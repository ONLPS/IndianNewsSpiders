66,Sahil Joshi,"Finally, Marathas (not Marathi) have got what they have been waiting for many years – reservation in government jobs and education. Historically known as warriors who fought for Chhatrapati Shivaji's army, Marathas had been demanding reservation for the last decade based on their claim of being socially and economically backward. In the end, it was their sheer strength and might in Maharashtra that got them what they wanted. Comprising nearly 30 per cent of Maharashtra’s population, Marathas can’t be ignored by any political party. Evidence of this was their   across Maharashtra two years back that was enough to show their strength. After the Congress-NCP government   and lost the reservation case in the court back in 2014, the Devendra Fadanvis government has now managed to get the desired report from the backward class commission and again passed the bill giving reservation to Marathas. Yet, what remains to be seen is if the bill can pass the legal test in its present form, given that someone or the other will surely knock the court’s doors and force the government to defend the decision to award  . But what worries me the most is the backward class commission  which has shown poor social and economic status of the community which has been politically very strong in Maharashtra ever since the formation of the state in 1960. The report shows that even after nearly 58 years of the state’s formation, in Marathas 14 per cent of the community remains illiterate while 35 per cent have barely completed primary education. 44 per cent have managed to pass 10th or 12th standard exams and merely seven per cent are graduates. This reflects very poorly on the community leaders who have been ruling the state for many years – especially when political heavyweights from the community are the ones who are running private colleges and educational institutes across the state. Many of them have been called ""Shiksha samrat"" as they are the ones who got the license to start private medical and engineering colleges in the late 80s. Despite this dominance, it looks like they seem to have completely failed to uplift their community when it comes to education. Another worrying thing is that the backward class commission’s findings on Maratha’s economic status show their leaders in very poor light. As per this report, 93 per cent of the maratha families earn less than 1 lakh Rs per annum and 24 per cent of these families live below the poverty line. Further, 71 per cent of the Maratha peasant’s land holding is so less that they are still in the category of marginal or poor farmers. And all of this is when Maharashtra is the leading state in the cooperative sector which is supposed to be working for the betterment of poor and marginal farmers. Out of 179 cooperative sugar factories, nearly 75 per cent are run by the leaders from the Maratha community. Elections to get control of these factories are fought with the same intensity and vigor of that of any assembly or corporation election. Same is the situation of district cooperative banks, cooperative milk federations, the agriculture produce marketing committees (apmc) across the state – the majority of which are again ruled or controlled by the leaders of the Maratha community. Yet we have witnessed many Maratha MLAs offering to resign in support of their communities demand for the reservation. These findings say a lot about the leadership this community has given to the state of Maharashtra. With  , half of the state's 288 MLAs and nearly half the number of cabinet ministers from the community, Marathas since 1960 have enjoyed might and strength to change their situation. Probably, for this reason, the Mandal Commission in the late 70s had called it   and in 2003-04 the then backward class commission refused to approve backward status to the Marathas. But the current study shows that when some were enjoying political and economic power due to sheer strength of the community across Maharashtra most of the community kept struggling to improve its condition. Muslims, on the other hand, are yet to get their   in education that was approved by the High Court. The reason probably is that simply do not have the political and numerical might to get it passed by the government.  Despite subsequent commissions and committees clearly highlighting the poor condition of Muslims and their poor presence in government jobs, it doesn’t look like Muslims will be able to get what they have been asking for as they simply do not have that presence in the state which can mould its political opinion. But looking at the condition of the mighty Marathas in Maharashtra – as stated by the backward commission report – one really wonders if it really helps even if your community is politically strong. ",2018-11-30,"Devendra Fadnavis,BJP,Congress-ncp,Maharashtra",How Maratha leaders have failed their community in Maharashtra,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/marathas-maharashtra-congress-ncp-bjp-devendra-fadnavis/story/1/28084.html
67,Majid Hyderi,"J&K Governor SP Malik’s  , of treating Jammu and Kashmir Bank (J&K Bank) Ltd as a public sector unit (PSU) and making it more accountable, has divided Kashmir into the proverbial haves and have-nots. While the common people have largely welcomed the much-needed push for accountability, Kashmir’s “powerful and the mighty”, including politicians and some businessmen, are up in arms. By virtue of the orders approved by the State Administrative Council (SAC) under the chairmanship of the Governor, the bank has been brought under the ambit of Right to Information Act (RTI), the Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) guidelines and the state legislature. The development has taken place exactly when the previous Peoples Democratic Party-led government under Mehbooba Mufti has reportedly  of irregularly appointing over 2,000 undeserving candidates in the bank, besides recommending bank loans worth crores to her favourites, including a Chennai based brother-in-law, against disproportionate mortgage. Thus, the PDP has reacted against the Raj Bhawan orders for apparently obvious reasons. Apart from issuing statements and staging protests, the PDP president personally spoke to union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, seeking immediate revocation of the orders. 
 
 The PDP’s arch rival in the state, National Conference, sounds no different. In fact, the NC left behind the PDP in taking out the first protest rally. On November 26, in the wake of a separatist call for  the “killing spree” in the valley, the NC leaders took out a procession in Srinagar — but in support of the J&K Bank. On the same day, Awami Ittehad Party leader Engineer Rashid held a parallel protest. Interestingly however, unlike the NC, he struck a balance between the hartal call by separatists and his concern for the bank — Rashid dedicated his protest rally to both the issues. Kashmir’s head priest and Hurriyat M Chairperson, Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, went a step further by saying that the decision could have implications similar to what was witnessed after the killing of Hizbul commander and poster boy of new-age militancy Burhan Muzaffar Wani. Mirwaiz, whose father-in-law reportedly is a defaulter to the tune of Rs 5 crore at the J&K Bank,  the government to be prepared for a “2016-like agitation” if the orders are not revoked. Interestingly, the 2016- agitation, that left around a hundred civilians dead and more than 20,000 wounded in Kashmir, had finally ended when the government blessed veteran separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani’s grandson with a backdoor job.  But then the stand of Kashmir’s business community looks shocking, with some business leaders saying outright that they are against accountability. Yes, you read it right. The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries in a statement  “opposes the decision of the State Administrative Council (SAC) to bring the J&K Bank Ltd under the purview of RTI, CVC.” The KCCI has even criticised Governor Malik for his people-friendly decision of getting appointed 582 candidates who cleared exams and interviews, but were replaced with appointees recommended by politicians during the Mehbooba Mufti government. The KCCI questioned these fresh employments, saying: “It is for the first time that Bank had to engage additionally 582 banking associates when they were not needed as per the requirements… Engagement of our unemployed youth cannot be resolved by providing the services in the Bank.” As per news reports, the J&K Bank is in a bad condition mainly because of  granted to some big names who didn’t pay back. As per the  , the loans were even being diverted to the Middle East, something which sounds like a ‘reverse-Hawala’. The  said: “Interestingly, many of the valley hoteliers, who have defaulted to repay the loans have recently managed more borrowings from the bank and diverted the same loan amount to Dubai and other gulf countries for investment.” The report also reveals that there are hundreds of willful defaulters from within and outside the state. Established in 1938 by the then-Dogra Maharajas, J&K Bank is the only state -promoted bank in the country. But the bank’s condition has reportedly turned so bad that its share value has dipped to Rs.39.5. As per news reports, the state government this year purchased its shares at Rs 79 and invested more than Rs 532 crore, which raised the government’s share in the bank to 59.3%. As per the Raj Bhawan, the move to bring the bank under ambit of RTI, CVC and state legislature aims to “insulate the bank from political influence used for backdoor appointments and sanctioning massive loans to big business houses” following reports of large-scale scams in the bank. “Extension of RTI Act and CVC guidelines is only aimed at promoting Good Governance and transparency in the functioning of the Bank, as this premiere financial institution has often been questioned on both these counts by the general public,” an official handout has said. With major shares lying with the government, J&K Bank is already supposed to be a PSU. But prominent economist and PDP leader Haseeb Drabu says treating J&K Bank as PSU would bring undue political interventions. Well, somebody should ask this former CEO of J&K Bank what made him resign from the chair in 2008, when the NC had come to power. What’s wrong in J&K becoming a PSU? After all one of the largest banks in the subcontinent, the State Bank of India, is also a PSU. And then, why are only the influential sections of Kashmir up in arms? Why are common Kashmiris silent? And, why are Jammu and Ladakh silent altogether?  In a state with a population of over one crore, where almost every citizen bears a savings account in J&K Bank, why are common people not taking to the streets to join the cry of the influential few? Is there something fishy here, that only Kashmir’s powerful are feeling insecure?",2018-11-30,"Mehbooba Mufti,Governor satya pal malik,PSU,Jammu and kashmir bank",Why only the high and mighty of Kashmir are unhappy with J&K Bank becoming a PSU,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/j-amp-k-bank-psu-governor-satya-pal-malik-mehbooba-mufti-national-conference/story/1/28083.html
68,Ashish Pandey,"With elections just a week away, Telangana is witnessing high-decibel electioneering. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has finished one round of campaign in the poll-bound state, where people will cast their votes on December 7, he will campaign once again on December 3, the last day for campaigning in the state. The state has also witnessed high decibel campaigning from the Congress with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and party president Rahul Gandhi seeking votes for the grand alliance, or Prajakutami, the rainbow alliance between Congress, Telugu Desam party (TDP), Left and Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS). Telangana is witnessing a tight contest between the ruling Telangana Rastra Samiti (TRS) and the Congress-led Prajakutami, with both leaving no stone unturned in wooing voters. While Congress state unit chief Uttam Kumar Reddy has famously announced that if Prajakutami loses, he will quit politics, TRS leader, caretaker minister and son of chief minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao, K Taraka Rama Rao (KTR), too has announced his retirement from politics if the ruling party looses. While the TRS is banking on development projects, including several cash benefit schemes, and believes the poll sops can bring them back to power, the Congress-led Opposition front is targeting the ruling ‘pink party’ over his failed promises like two-bedroom houses for the poor, one lakh jobs per year for unemployed youths and  . The state has a population of around 12 per cent Muslims and so the reservation promise can prove to be a big mobiliser. Interestingly, while the Hyderabad-based All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) is standing firm with the TRS, it has so far refused to enter a formal alliance with the party. The AIMIM is still campaigning for the ruling party and at the same time contesting on eight Assembly segments. Asaduddin Owaisi’s party, which had seven MLAs in the now dissolved Assembly, could emerge as the kingmaker once the results are announced. Asaduddin brother, Akbaruddin Owaisi, has already hinted at that by making a  , “Whoever becomes the chief minister, doesn’t he bend before us? Haven’t they all listened to us? So, who has the real weight in the balance? — AIMIM,” he said. “We will show the power of AIMIM after December 11. We will be political king,” Akbaruddin said. The controversial statement attracted criticism both from the Congress and the BJP, which won five seats in 2014. While the TRS is fighting its first ever battle as a ruling party in the state, the Congress sees it as a rehearsal for 2019 general election. TRS, which won  , increased its number to 90 with MLAs from Congress and TDP changing loyalties and joining the ruling party. It has repeated all most all of its sitting MLAs (apart from four) and is contesting the poll using KCR as the face of its campaign. The party believes that once again the charismatic KCR will bring it back to power. However, the party is also facing serious anti-incumbency against its sitting MLAs and so the Congress hopes that it stands a chance to form a government in the state. The Congress is also banking on the power of the Reddy community which has been given 33 seats (out of 99). The leadership is however worried about Muslim votes, which they see as a crucial factor. As the AIMIM is supporting the TRS, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who had earlier served as in-charge of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, is trying to garner support from the community on behalf of the Congress. The  , has become a crucial battle field. Traditionally dominated by ‘settlers’, with roots in Andhra Pradesh, the Congress leadership believes that its alliance partner TDP, can help them win. During 2014 also the TDP was the best performer in the GHMC area. Party chief and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu held a two-day long campaign and also shared dais with AICC president Rahul Gandhi. On the other hand, the TRS has found a friend in AIMIM and its supremo, Asaduddin Owaisi, who represents Hyderabad in Parliament. The AIMIM won seven seats in 2014 and is contesting on eight this time. TRS’ second in command, KTR, who is known as a young leader with reach in the middle and upper middle classes, is expected to attract the educated youth to vote for the party. KTR is campaigning extensively in the city constituency apart from wooing deferent non-Telugu communities in favour of his party. Traditionally, TRS has had a strong base in north Telangana and in 2014 out of 54 seats (spread across districts Adilabad, Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Medak and Warangal) it won 51 seats. The party also performed well in the traditional Congress stronghold, South Telangana (Mahabubnagar, Nalgonda, and Khammam districts) by winning 24 seats (out of 36) Assembly seats. In the 2009 polls, the TRS couldn’t even open its account and so this time with anti-incumbency, the Congress is putting in all efforts in both north and south Telangana to shatter the TRS’ dreams of holding on to power. Meanwhile, the election is also witnessing unprecedented seizure of cash by the Election Commission and enforcement agencies. So far, a whopping over Rs 100 crore have been seized, which includes Rs 89 crore in cash, liquor worth over Rs 9 crore, gold and silver worth Rs 7 crore, and other banned items.",2018-11-30,"TDP,TRS,Assembly elections,Telangana assembly elections",Telangana polls: Who stands to win the big battle,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/telangana-assembly-elections-assembly-elections-tdp-trs/story/1/28075.html
69,Aroon Purie,"For millions of fans, Rajinikanth is simply Thalaiva (leader), a man who inspires frenzied adulation unlike that seen anywhere else in India, an inheritor of the mantle held by a long line of icons, from Sivaji Ganesan to MGR. The Dravidian movement was atheistic, so what explains Rajinikanth's demigod like status? 'When Dravidian atheism said ""No God"", it never said ""no hero""', according to  , an award-winning 2015 documentary that tries to explain his unique fandom. The Rajinikanth story is well-known. The bus conductor from Bengaluru who stormed Tamil cinema with a string of megahits, trademark dialogues, mannerisms and gravity-defying feats to become one of Asia's highest-paid movie stars with a fan following even in distant Japan. A rags-to-riches tale that is the stuff of cinematic legend and even a chapter in school text-books. Rajinikanth, 67, now stands at an interesting crossroads in his career. His Rs 540 crore film  , out on 10,000 screens this week, is the costliest Indian film ever made. The release comes at a time when the star is contemplating an entry into politics. Both of the state's Dravidian parties have lost their iconic leaders, Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, in the past two years. Can Rajinikanth 2.0 fill this vacuum in a state addicted to messianic political cults? The superstar announced his intent to join politics on December 31 last year, but is yet to launch a political party. Ironically, for a man of the masses, he can often be inscrutable — a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. His interviews are often film promotions. He rarely speaks about his early life and of the world outside cinema. That's what makes his   interview so unique. Over the course of an hour at Brindavan, his three-storeyed home in Poes Garden, Chennai, Rajinikanth spoke candidly to Group Editorial Director Raj Chengappa and Deputy Editor Amarnath K Menon not only about his life and films but on a range of issues like secularism, corruption and his political vision for the state. Rajinikanth's off-screen persona, shorn of star accoutrements, is a stark and constant reminder of the illusions of cinema. Chengappa, who interviewed the late star-turned-politician MG Ramachandran, notes the difference between the two icons. ""MGR would never be photographed without his trademark wool cap and dark glasses. Rajinikanth, on the other hand, has no such hang-ups."" The star's political fortunes now ride on the success of   — if it breaks the box office, it will fast-track his entry into politics. His legion of fans are going to be the key movers. His fan clubs, the Rajini Makkal Mandrams, were relaunched in January this year and will likely form the bulwark of the star's plan to contest all the state's 234 constituencies in the assembly election in 2021. His goal will be to stage a thunderous MGR-like political entry while avoiding the mistakes made by recent star-turned-politicians like Vijayakanth. The star is conscious the road ahead is not a 'path of flowers', as he says, but seems to be working to a plan to cultivate a voter base and convert his star power into political capital before the formal launch of his own party.

70,Srijana Mitra Das,"Our relationships with nations are deeply personal things. So intimate, you don’t even know when a nation envelops you with its blanket of stories, some borrowed, some, your own. In the backdrop of Kartarpur, I have a story to share. Of how I got to know the nation of Pakistan. It was 2000. I was new at Cambridge University, on a scholarship that gave me all I could ever want, topping my class, surrounded by friends, winning student elections, discovering wine, living life to the fullest. Suddenly, I lost my father. It was, as Shah Rukh Khan says wryly of his loss, rather careless of me. A carelessness which filled me with anxiety. One that stopped me from understanding what had happened to my father — after all, just a few months ago, he was waving me goodbye after summer break. One that had me feeling my way through a new darkness, searching for him, as I tried to keep walking and not fall down. One that had me in tears, wondering how my short-sighted father could go anywhere without his glasses. His watch. His wallet. Without me. I changed. I stopped smiling. I stopped laughing. I stopped studying. I spent hours staring unseeingly at books while my mind worried about my father. My friends noticed. They were all from Pakistan. We had met as undergrads at the London School of Economics, a gang of them, boisterous, merry and flamboyant, studious, curious me. Somehow, something in their jokes, their gags, their songs, their warmth, their love of food made me laugh. They reminded me of home. And yet, they were so different. I must have seemed the same and before I knew it, I had been enveloped in a hug from Pakistan that lasted me years. Years in particular which went from shimmering light to utter dark. My Pakistani friends didn’t abandon me. On the contrary, as my world fell apart, they took me to their heart. My dearest friend invited me that winter to her wedding in Lahore. Friends came all the way to Delhi, stayed and traveled with me to Pakistan. With my friends, I discovered the most fabled city of the Punjab. Lahore was like a jewel box. At least, its central parts which were still dotted with luscious green parks. With wide, gracious streets. With sudden, breathtaking old havelis that sported the signboards of old times, ghostly letterings, Hindi names, Gurmukhi scripts, glimmering under new Urdu lettering. I saw so much of Lahore. Its  , where the young people danced joyously to perfectly rehearsed Bollywood numbers. Its  , which simply groaned with food. Its parties, which in their sheer voluptuousness, their capacity to lie back on cushions of silk and drink, think and talk about Spinoza and sex while the staff silently pottered about, gleamed through dark nights. Its feudals — about 50 families ran the country. Its Aitchison College — alma mater of Imran Khan — with its smart classrooms, its huge lawns, its tiny snack shop that sold ‘hud-dugs’ with pink sauce. Its Fort, all terrazzos of marble and   of jeweled stones that gleamed dully in the sunshine. Its Liberty Market where buying shawls — everyone thought I was Pakistani — the vendor told me,  . Its Café Zouk where we ate great Continental food and its 'androon shaher ka' Gawal Mandi where we ate South Asian food that melted in ghee and hot spice. And its Canal where driving, we got lost in a thick December fog and, cracking up in laughs, followed the car ahead of us, only to drive right into his drive and be greeted by a most quizzical guide. Lahore was magical. Its magic didn’t lie in its beauty, in its haunting quality of the past wrapped around its shoulders like a gossamer shawl, in its ability to shake that shawl off and break into a mad bhangra. It was magical for me because, despite my grief, it made me laugh. It made me love. It made me live again. For that, and for all the tenderness and merriness and humour and warmth my Pakistani friends filled my life with, I will always be eternally grateful. But I will also be eternally vigilant. For our relationship with nations is emotional, yes. But it is also a sharp intellectual tryst. Soon after I visited Lahore for the first time, 9/11 happened in the United States. The world changed. Suddenly, with its brow furrowed, it became a world that would wall itself off, rather than be devastatingly attacked again. A world which would avenge itself by attacking not Saudi Arabia, where 9/11's attackers mainly came from, but instead, Afghanistan. In that world, I saw Pakistan change. As I returned, to see friends, attend shaadis, do research for the PhD I'd started on Punjab and militancy, I literally saw Pakistan shrink into itself. I saw the nation that only had its   to recommend it fear its own joy of life. With the War on Terror raining bombs and funds on Af-Pak, Pakistan made a choice. Its state abandoned all notions of development or governance. It became a terror ka zamindar — a feudal lord of radicalism and violence, growing this, yoking human beings to its cultivation, selling it, buying it, renting it, enjoying life through it. And doing nothing else. But Pakistan's terror-feudalism came with a twist. Slowly, the 'Talibs', the 'beardy-weirdies', the 'fundos' who, my friends – educated, liberal and cosmopolitan – had scoffed at, creeped out from the margins of their mosques to take centre-stage. And people like my friends found themselves pushed aside. Of course they were also to blame. Their fathers, after all, were the feudals who wouldn’t share. The businessmen who had flats in Mayfair. The army generals who injected opium and violence into the veins of the Afghans. They just didn’t know when the sons they had thus fathered would suddenly become their  . For me, the turning point in understanding Pakistan came with  .  In 2002, the 38-year-old   journalist, with an oval, clever face and a jaunty smile, was kidnapped in Karachi and slain, executed on video by a mad Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who slit his throat and sent out the filmed murder to the world. It was the first ISIS-style execution. But it was enough for me to understand Pakistan, the old Pakistan, even its genial post-Partition ghost which I had seen, was dead. The new Pakistan was a very different nation. From a country which reveled in the rhetoric of its large heart, it became one whose vision and emotions were to contract simply to hate, to an evil domination of the vulnerable. Or, the brave. In 2005, the famous shrine of Pir Rakhel Shah was attacked. In 2007, Benazir Bhutto was assassinated. In 2011, Salman Taseer was killed. In 2012, Malala Yousafzai was shot. In 2014, children at school in Rawalpindi were brutally murdered. Pakistan was over. The old Pakistan, that is. But such was the magic of Lahore that even a mention of that silken, faded city, with its remnants of palaces and its broken pieces of verse, its green parks, before they were filled with Christians shot dead by fundos, can bring back a certain heady charm. Therefore, it is imperative for India to be vigilant. Yes, many Pakistanis are super people. But their state is anything but that. It is, if anything, even more anti-India, even more venal and even more venomous towards us than it ever was. It now carries with it so much venom, it has corroded its own self. And it has only poison to offer us, in the guise of a jhappi, a kebab, a silken kameez, a deliciously rhetorical jawaab. Don’t buy it. This is simply clever PR.  Which will make an advertisement of the noble intentions of Prime Minister Imran Khan and use India’s naivete to normalise itself before a doubtful world. And then, before we know it, we will be stabbed deep in the back again, by a deep state that uses the Kashmiris it can find to come lob stones and bullets and bombs at us. Don’t buy it. Don’t ever confuse the Pakistani people with its state — poor things, most of the time, the people are the greatest victims of the Pakistani state. But, much though I sympathise, I see no reason for us to join them. It took years of research, ethnography and thought for me to make the clear distinction between those Pakistanis who were my friends, and their state, which would always be my antagonist. Some years after 2000, I finished my studies and found myself drawn to another nation. One that offered me my first job. One that took me into its arms but also threw at me tough challenges. One that fed me — and taught me how to earn to feed myself. And how to value that act and never take it for granted, for the right to work, to earn, to give yourself a good, a dignified, a joyful life — a right each one of us has here — is what distinguishes India from Pakistan. There, that right has always been seen as the exclusive preserve of a few. It is the exact opposite in India. After my studies, I returned home. And I fell slowly, madly and irrevocably in love with my motherland. But that is another story.",2018-11-29,"Navjot Singh Sidhu,Imran Khan,Kartarpur corridor,Indo-Pak ties","Keep it cool: With Pakistan, India should never confuse deep friendships for the deep state",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kartarpur-corridor-india-pakistan-ties-imran-khan-dont-confuse-deep-friendships-for-the-deep-state/story/1/28040.html
71,Shuja-ul-Haq,"In the world that we live in today the metaphoric phrase of ‘shooting the messenger’ is so apt. Journalists have become increasingly vulnerable to attacks both online and offline. Though in much of the world we see awareness on journalists’ right to access of information and expression. But it is also a fact that the incidents of threats, virtual abuse, harassment and even physical injury have been constantly on the rise. For those who investigate stories and work from difficult zones, the threat is compounded. On the evening of June 14, three unknown gunmen   and his two security guards right outside his office. They all died on the spot. Like most of us working from this conflict zone, Shujaat was also a victim of online vitriol before the physical attack on him. His death had a calamitous effect on us. But the life, the work and the reportage had to go on. At the   (GIJN) in Seoul, celebrated Malaysian cartoonist  , popularly known as Zunar, delivered the keynote address. He has penned nine books and is also facing nine charges of sedition, which carry a penalty of 43 years of imprisonment. All this for his satirical cartoons and tweets decrying government scandals and misdealings. He has been facing several attacks, crackdowns and raids for years now. At the Seoul conference, Zunar told a gathering of close to 500 journalists from across the region, “We all have fear. Yes we all do. But when it comes to the question, which one is bigger, fear or responsibility. The responsibility is bigger. I told them you can ban my book, you can ban my cartoons but you cannot ban my mind.” True, it is this spirit and the passion of storytelling that keeps a journalist going on. But in the wake of increasing cases of assault in various forms, it is also equally important to know and understand the ways and means to cope with the threat. The flood of harassment today is of different shapes and means; death threats and physical assaults, legal threats and jailings, trolling and doxing. Umar Cheema is a known investigative journalist from Pakistan, a country categorised by CPJ as the world's deadliest place for the press in 2010. On September 4, 2010,  . He was held captive for more than six hours; during this time the masked individuals tortured him and asked him to stop criticising the government in the articles. “I was beaten up, undressed, shaved, and photographed in humiliating poses. The torture was physical and also psychological. They told me if I write again I will be killed next time,” said Umar Cheema at the GIJN conference. Cheema, however, thought if he cows down to the pressure and harassment it would never end. He decided to speak up. ""It made me stronger and made my enemies more cowardly. Their efforts to intimidate me but it backfired,"" Cheema said. On December 29, 2017,  . They had served a two-month sentence for operating a drone near the parliament compound in Naypyidaw. It was a first of its kind sentence.  a freelance journalist was one of these three journalists. At one of the session of the GIJN conference he made a passionate speech and tried to throw light on the plight of journalists working in his country. “Things aren’t good at all. I don’t believe I was arrested for a mere drone flying. They were keeping an eye even before. I realised this during my interrogation. They would ask me questions about my previous writings on various ethnic groups,” said Aung. He, however, also wasn’t someone who would give up so easily. “We went through it. In the jail I kept reading and writing. And once I am out now I continue to do my work,” he said. In India, the issue of harassment of journalists is equally grave.  , which is compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), reflects growing animosity towards journalists. In its ranking the country has dropped from 136 to 138 out of total 180. Journalist Gauri Lankesh was about to walk through her front door in Bangalore on the evening of September 5, 2017, when she was shot dead by a motorcyclist. New cases of online and offline abuse towards journalists are reported on regular basis in India. Hate speeches targeting the scribes are amplified on social media by troll armies favouring certain political groups. Many of these attacks are systematic and well-planned rather than being random. While there is a worldwide debate over addressing the issue of intimidation of the press, very little seems to to be happening in the Asian countries. Most journalists who have faced these attacks will tell you that the first step towards dealing with deliberate harassment is acknowledgement that it is happening. Speaking up is the key to coping. This not only results in support cropping up from different quarters, but it also defeats the primary objective of the attackers, which most often than not is intimidating into silence.",2018-11-29,"Gauri Lankesh,Journalists,Umar cheema,Shujaat  bukhari",Why it is imperative for journalists to speak up against repeated attacks,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/shujaat-bukhari-umar-cheema-gauri-lankesh-world-press-freedom-index-journalists/story/1/28057.html
72,Harmeet Shah Singh,"When you spot media and political jamboree around so-called India-Pakistan peace initiatives, it’s not unwise to be a little skeptical. That’s my mantra, which stems from the history of measures that attracted a bit too much of TV cameras. If not all, many such moves which began with a fanfare — and hailed as a “thaw” in our typical media jargon — have ended up as damp squibs. Forget non-Sikh citizens of both India and Pakistan, if anyone had taken a poll of the global Sikh community about what Sri Kartarpur Sahib stood for before Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu  the Pakistani army chief, the findings would have been startling. In how many Sikh homes have you ever seen images of Sri Kartarpur Sahib, now being projected — and rightly so — as the center of the Sikh faith? Isn’t it Sri Darbar Sahib in Amritsar — the Golden Temple for the world outside — which has been portrayed as the nucleus of Sikhi post-Partition? The Sikhs are not to be blamed for having ignored or neglected this shrine barely four km from India’s international border with Pakistan. They have been brainwashed into consigning Sri Kartarpur Sahib into oblivion. Generations that grew up on this side of the border after 1947 received scant education about the historical significance of the gurdwara, which has caught global headlines overnight because of the highest-profile politics linked to it. Until Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan breaks ground to give visa-free access to Indian Sikh pilgrims to Sri Kartarpur Sahib, the sacred site will largely be referred to as the final resting place of Guru Nanak, who passed in 1539. But the symbolism associated with Kartarpur is much higher. It’s here that Guru Nanak settled after his life-long missionary travels across the subcontinent to as far as the Arab world and back. Guru Nanak spent around 18 years at Kartarpur. It’s here where the institution of a community kitchen, or langar, which broke caste, social, religious and geographical distinctions, was formalised. It’s here where Guru Nanak amalgamated “kirat”, or honest labour, with spiritual meditation (naam) and charity (vand chhakna). It’s here where Guru Nanak anointed his successor, whom he named Guru Angad. It’s here where Guru Nanak discarded his own sons as worthy of leading humanity in the noble mission that eventually culminated in 1708 – the year Guru Gobind Singh invested spiritual authority in Sri Guru Granth Sahib. If not everyone, many Sikhs had inadequate knowledge about the importance of Sri Kartarpur Sahib in shaping up the Sikh school of thought till the hawks in our media and political establishment pounced on Sidhu for embracing the Pakistani general in 2018. Earlier, the sighting of this holy and historically enriching location remained limited to some enlightened devotees viewing it through their binoculars from a border post at Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur. Our bilateral history bears witness to failure of events hyped up as peace endeavours between the arch-rival neighbours. The much-publicised Lahore bus trip, the Agra summit, the confidence-building measures (CBMs) and so forth — all of them were designed for media consumption and all eventually collapsed. It’s become fashionable for every new head of government on both sides to launch something ostensibly packaged as bilateral peace in his or her term. On each occasion, what’s disseminated on TV is an artificial glee on the faces of political leaders and over-enthusiastic media-persons covering such events.This show of delight evaporates into thin air in weeks or months, as the two sides get back to their routine business of hostility. Whatever his compulsions behind what he said while inaugurating the faith corridor’s Indian side, Punjab’s chief minister, Capt Amarinder Singh,  the project before it took off, knowingly or unknowingly. Though a state CM — that too of Punjab, which shares a common heritage with its counterpart province across the border — Capt Singh illustrated that it’s adversity that defines India-Pakistan ties and not flying doves. “The Pakistan PM should rein in his army as the ISI, which works under the army, works against us. Such army chiefs (referring to Gen Bajwa) should understand that we have a bigger army than they have, and we are fully prepared. There is a limit… If you do it (provoke) repeatedly, then India will also have to think,” he warned. If that doesn’t explain the futility of the proposed passage as a peace measure, what else will? For now, sadly, it just appears to be a one-day television entertainment crafted strategically by state powers in India and Pakistan over something as spiritually sublime as Kartarpur.",2018-11-28,"Navjot Singh Sidhu,Narendra Modi,Imran Khan,Agra summit",How jingoism defeats the purpose of Kartarpur corridor from the word go,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kartarpur-corridor-jingoism-lahore-bus-trip-agra-summit-imran-khan-narendra-modi-navjot-singh-sidhu-sikhism/story/1/28032.html
73,Owais Talib,"Now that the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly   and the Election Commission of India has announced tentative dates for fresh assembly elections, there are already wider claims of a 'third front' emerging in Jammu and Kashmir. This   is led by Sajad Lone, an erstwhile separatist and a former representative from the Handwara constituency, which also happens to be his native town. However, the larger question among political and public circles remains, ""Has an alternative in the form of a third front really emerged on the political landscape of Jammu and Kashmir?"" The correct answer lies in understanding the history of the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Conference (JKPC), headed by Sajad Lone. The Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference was founded by Sajad's father, the late Abdul Ghani Lone, in 1978. The leader made his entry into state politics as a member of the legislative assembly, on a Congress ticket in the year 1967. In subsequent years, Abdul Ghani Lone went on to become minister for education and health in Mir Qasim's cabinet. However, in 1976, Indira Gandhi expelled Abdul Ghani Lone from the Congress and he decided to fight the upcoming elections on a Janata Party ticket. In 1977, Lone contested elections on a Janata Party ticket and won. However, within a year, he resigned from the Janata Party and floated his own party – the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Conference (JKPC). Though the JKPC was originally floated as a mainstream political party, with the aim of working for the restoration of the internal autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir, in subsequent years, JKPC also reportedly emerged as one of the separatist groups advocating a larger cry for an independent Jammu and Kashmir. However, in the later years of his life, Abdul Lone was seen as a moderate voice among separatist groups – something that finally led to his tragic  in 2002. Sajad Lone and his elder brother Bilal stayed aloof from politics. It was only after the death of their father that the two brothers joined politics in Jammu and Kashmir. The JKPC broke into two factions, one headed by Sajad, another by Bilal.  While Bilal Lone’s faction continues to remain in the separatist camp, Sajad Lone entered mainstream electoral politics in 2009. And in 2014, a Sajad Lone-led JKPC contested assembly elections, fielding candidates in many parts of the Valley, winning two seats from north Kashmir’s Kupwara district. Sajad Lone was then included in the BJP–PDP coalition government on a BJP quota and inducted into the cabinet as the minister for science and technology and animal husbandry. However, Lone  refused to take charge as he was not given a ministry of his choice. He was so miffed, it is claimed, that he boarded a flight to Srinagar the very next day where he termed his induction as an insult by the BJP. After he turned down that offer, Lone was inducted into the cabinet as the minister for social welfare. In my opinion, though, this shows Lone’s political ambitions are more power-centric rather than people-centric. He apparently believed that animal husbandry - the most vital part of any state's economy - was not worthy enough of being taken care by him. Yet, Lone was representing a rural area of Kashmir, where a major chunk of the population eke out their livelihood through the rearing of cattle. In my view, had Sajad Lone been really sincere about the welfare of his people, he would have taken charge of such an important ministry and tried to make a difference in the lives of people who are directly dependent on livestock. This was the first blow to his claims of being an 'agent of change' and a person who believes in making a difference to ordinary people’s lives. Now, during his tenure as social welfare minister in Jammu and Kashmir, Sajad Lone didn't make any significant changes on ground-level. He too  started to adjust his own favoured party men in various plum positions.  Frequently these days, Sajad Lone, in his press conferences and on his social media,  Mehbooba Mufti and Omer Abdullah as dynasts who have held the state of Jammu and Kashmir hostage to their whims for decades. He has heroically vowed to throw these dynasts out of power. But the larger question is, isn’t Sajad a dynast himself? Sajad Lone heads a faction of a party founded by his father and has been the president of it since 2002. There is no tradition of internal elections in his party for the post of president. He has been running the party for many years as its president and recently, while staking a claim for forming a government, presented himself as a chief ministerial candidate. So, if Omar and Mehbooba are dynasts because no one except their family members heads their parties, isn’t Sajad Lone also a dynast by precisely such standards? The JKNC and PDP still have a tradition of symbolic internal elections for the post of president. However, the Peoples Conference is yet to have such a tradition, even symbolic. As Junaid Mattu, a JKPC leader and the new Mayor of Srinagar, wrote in one of his blogs in   upon his joining JKNC, ""After three years with the Peoples’ Conference and with due respect to Mr Lone, I eventually decided to not stay in a party which has to function on the whims of one single man.” So, as I see it, the much vaunted 'third front' of Jammu and Kashmir is nothing but another dynast emerging on the political landscape, aiming to replace the already existing dynasts.",2018-11-27,"Polls,Jammu and kashmir peoples conference,Valley,Jammu and Kashmir",Sajad Lone is also a dynast.

74,Sushant Sareen,"It isn't quite clear if Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been deeply influenced by his Pakistani counterpart who has earned the sobriquet of 'U-turn Khan', or if it is the other way round. Because when it comes to Pakistan, and to an extent, Kashmir, it has become difficult to keep count of the U-turns made by the Narendra Modi government. Worse, while Mr Modi's devotees marvel at his ability to surprise everyone by his U-turns (especially on Pakistan), the fact is that he invariably ends up getting rude surprises of his own — the   that followed his Lahore visit is emblematic of this trend. If there is one defining characteristic of Mr Modi's Pakistan policy, it is a flip-flop approach. But, aside of the lack of policy clarity that this approach underlines, what is more worrying is the fact that every policy flip inevitably leads to a policy flopping. The latest U-turns have been made on two of the most serious and sensitive foreign and security policy issues confronting India. The first, of course, is the decision of the government to bite the Pakistani bait on the Kartarpur corridor. The second is even more egregious: using a   (or is he a yoga entrepreneur?) to bring in a dubious former Norwegian Prime Minister to mediate/meddle in Kashmir, overturning the national policy of shunning any foreign or third-party interference. No one is quite sure as to what prompted these tectonic policy flips — is it vanity, is it sheer vacuity, is it some petty political point-scoring, ignoring the disastrous implications of what has been conceded by the government, is it megalomania or just mania, is it a sign that the Indian political establishment has totally lost the ability to think things through and look at issues strategically rather than tactically? Honestly, your guess is as good as mine. How utterly muddled the thinking is in the government is clear from the mixed signals sent on the Kartarpur issue. There is the usual hyperbole from the Prime Minister who has equated the Kartarpur Corridor with the fall of the Berlin Wall. But the External Affairs Minister excused herself from attending the ground-breaking ceremony of the Corridor in Pakistan because of prior commitments. Strange, isn't it, that while something as epochal as the proverbial Berlin Wall is falling, the EAM is busy in some low-level political campaign! The analogy of the Berlin Wall collapsing is in itself quite bizarre. Do members of the ruling party have absolutely no sense of history when they draw such an analogy? Do they even realise the meaning of what they are saying? Perhaps not, given the appalling mindlessness which made the government pick the 10th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks by Pakistan to organise the ground-breaking ceremony of the Corridor on the Indian side. The speeches made at the ground-breaking ceremony don't however change the fundamental reality of India-Pakistan relations. To put it very bluntly, the Iron Curtain on the Radcliffe Line isn't going anywhere, something borne out from India's refusal to attend the SAARC Summit until Pakistan ends export of terrorism. Be that as it may, the question that isn't being answered by the Indian government is what prompted the U-turn on Kartarpur. Just a couple of months back, the government had brushed aside this gambit of Pakistan. But suddenly, the cabinet has given the green light to the proposal. So, what changed in these last few weeks? Was it some sort of international pressure? Was it an epiphany that prompted the Modi government to rush into something that even angels would avoid? Was it the old Prithviraj Chauhan syndrome or the saviour complex that afflicts every Indian leader who tries to pull Pakistan out of the hole it finds itself in? Even more important is the question — why is Pakistan so keen to push ahead with this Corridor now? Surely it isn't that the Pakistan military is taken in by the grating garrulousness of the comic-cricketeer-politician Navjot Sidhu. Nor can it be the case that the Islamic State of Pakistan has suddenly been infused with the milk of human kindness and has become sensitive to the sentiments of Sikhs to agree to opening the Kartarpur Corridor. There is also no evidence on ground that Pakistan has turned over a new leaf and is genuinely interested in making peace with India. If anything, the Pakistanis have been working overtime to reignite the flames of terrorism and separatism, not just in Kashmir but also in Punjab — the attack on the Nirankari congregation, the Khalistan propaganda in Pakistan and in Western countries, the entire Referendum 2020 programme bears witness to Pakistan's sinister game-plan. And, despite such compelling evidence and intelligence on Pakistani perfidy — the portent of things to come became crystal clear when   was given the front seat in the Corridor inauguration ceremony in Pakistan — the government of India has displayed unseemly haste in biting the bait of the Kartarpur Corridor — why? While it is true that many Sikhs have for long demanded a corridor to Gurdwara Durbar Sahib in Kartarpur, they have also been demanding a Vatican-like status for Nankana Sahib. But the important thing is that while such pro forma demands are routinely made, there was neither any pressing demand, nor any movement for this Corridor at this point in time. Sure, a certain urgency was attached to the Corridor by the fact that next year is the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak. But 50 years back, we had the 500th anniversary which, by all accounts, has far greater salience that the 550th anniversary. If the Sikh faith could survive and thrive without the Corridor back then, the heavens wouldn't have fallen if there was no Corridor on the 550th anniversary. Such is the recklessness of the Indian government that it went ahead and announced the acceptance of the Corridor proposal without first working out the modalities and operational details of movement of people in the corridor. Ruling party spokespersons reflect the cavalier and careless attitude of the current dispensation when they nonchalantly declare that these will be decided as things proceed. In other words, India has agreed to start something without a clear idea on how that something will work on ground. It is difficult to think of another example of such a lackadaisical, irresponsible and imprudent handling of a sensitive security and political issue, involving an implacable and inimical enemy country. The sheer obtuseness of the government to think things through and understand the minefield it was entering is quite astounding. This Corridor will become a bone that is stuck in India's throat which it will neither be able to swallow, nor vomit out. Apart from the resentment that will brew in Punjab if there are controls and restrictions on the movement of pilgrims on the Corridor — the widespread public impression currently is that there will be free access — there is the entire spectre of Kartarpur Gurdwara being used to incite and instigate the Sikh pilgrims against India. A perfunctory study of the Pakistani media should have been enough to apprise the government of what lies in store for India. But the obsession with emerging as a visionary, the desire to create tamasha and think that slick event management and media handling amounts to good politics and substitutes for performance, has forced India into Pakistan's trap. While there will be problems if India is seen to be placing any kind of obstacle in the pilgrims' path — for instance, ruling party members are confidently proclaiming that if the Pakistanis engage in hostile propaganda, they will restrict movement or even close access to the Corridor — what is worse is the possibility that the Pakistanis will use access to the Corridor as a tool for blackmailing both the Indian state as well as Indian pilgrims. But, given the fact that the Indian political class and the obsequious babus have the memory of a goldfish when it comes to Pakistan, we have walked into a trap with our eyes wide open and our brains completely shut. Unlike India, which has virtually zero expertise on Pakistan, the Pakistanis know how to play the Indian politician — and the Indian media. For a country that has faced repeated betrayals from Pakistan, and which has paid a heavy price for Pakistan's treacherous behaviour, it is nothing short of a historical blunder for the government to once again place faith in Pakistan.

Chouhan took over as chief minister in 2005 and has since occupied the chair. The BJP leader can claim a strong public connect. A slew of welfare measures announced in the run-up to the election may work to his advantage. However, Chouhan also faces high anti-incumbency and the taint of the Vyapam scam.

While Nath is not contesting the polls, he is in the race for the chief minister’s chair should the Congress make a comeback in the state. While experience is valued by the party, what actually works against Nath is that he lacks a pro-poor image. The four-time Madhya Pradesh MP, represents Guna.

76,Kamlesh Sutar,"Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray made all the right political noises during his  . Thackeray may have called the visit a religious one, but it cannot be denied that the move had political undertones. Even though Thackeray was visiting Uttar Pradesh, he was actually catering to his constituency in Maharashtra, and the impact of the ‘religious tour’ is likely to be seen in the politics of the state. Experts believe the most obvious reason for Thackeray’s visit to Ayodhya was to exert pressure on the BJP, and position himself as a Hindutva icon. The larger story has an interesting element. Before the 2014 Assembly elections in Maharashtra, the BJP was a junior partner, playing second fiddle to the Shiv Sena. The Assembly elections were fiercely fought, with the two allies washing their dirty linen in public. Though the BJP had its presence in parts of rural Maharashtra, it was still perceived as a party from the Hindi heartland, and a party of Brahmins and Banias. OBC leader Gopinath Munde, who was instrumental in taking the BJP to the rural areas, had recently passed away in an accident. Shiv Sena had the upper hand as the local party, with an emotive outreach achieved by raking the ‘sons of the soil’ narrative and playing identity politics around Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, after whom the party is named. In order to match the Shiv Sena's local connect, the BJP coined a new slogan:   (With the blessings of Chhatrapati Shivaji, let us go along with Modi)."" Huge posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Raigad fort were put up with the slogan in every part of the state. The idea and slogan worked for the BJP, in building a new perception with a local touch. The BJP also achieved its larger objective of taking away Shivaji from Shiv Sena. The relations between the two allies were expected to improve when the Shiv Sena decided to join the Devendra Fadnavis-led government. On the contrary, the relations continued to sour, with Uddhav Thackeray's repeated attacks on PM Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. Always looking out for opportunities to outmanoeuvre the BJP, the Shiv Sena found one such big chance in the form of the Ayodhya issue. Uddhav, in his annual Dussehra rally,   to seek answers from the Centre on the delay in the construction of the Ram temple. Uddhav during his Ayodhya tour got a great response, giving his party the much-required saffron shot in the arm. At one function,   (king of Hindu hearts). Usually, one hears slogans of 'Jai Shivaji' during any Shiv Sena function, but in Ayodhya, there were additional chants of 'Jai Shri Ram'. Even before Uddhav went to Ayodhya, pictures of Lord Ram and the proposed Ram temple were already being seen at Shiv Sena programmes in Maharashtra.  When Uddhav visited the makeshift temple at the disputed site, he was warmly greeted even by Vishva Hindu Parishad workers, who were in the temple town for the outfit's own Dharm Sabha. Uddhav was the centre of attraction in Ayodhya during his two-day visit. Local sadhus who attended the ashirwad ceremony at Laxman Qilla praised the Shiv Sena chief for taking on the Modi government. Just like Modi was seen with Shivaji in Maharashtra, Uddhav was seen with Lord Ram in Ayodhya, with a slogan of ' '. While it is too early to talk about the political implications of Thackeray’s Ayodhya visit, one thing that prominently comes out is the important role Lord Ram will now play in Shiv Sena's politics. Not that the party has given up Shivaji to embrace Ram — it has aggressively pitched for the Ram temple and portrayed itself as a party openly talking for a law that would pave the way for the temple. The issue will — in one way or the other — put pressure on the BJP, both at the Centre and in Maharashtra. For Shiv Sena, it is also a sweet revenge of sorts — Uddhav has more or less hijacked Ram from the BJP, much like the latter hijacked Shivaji from Shiv Sena in 2014.",2018-11-26,"Shivaji,Ayodhya,Uddhav Thackeray","Shiv Sena has wrested Ram from BJP, just like BJP took away Shivaji from Sena",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uddhav-thackeray-ayodhya-ram-temple-shivaji-ram-mandir-shiv-sena/story/1/27991.html
77,Minhaz Merchant,"It was shortly after 10.30 pm when we first heard the news — there had been a shoot-out in Colaba in South Mumbai. Within minutes, it was clear this was no gang war. The Taj Mahal hotel in Colaba was under siege. Gunfire had been heard at Mumbai’s largest railway station, then called CST. Reports of gunmen in the Oberoi hotel filtered in. A shoot-out near Cama & Albless hospital, not far from police headquarters, was reported. The Jewish Nariman Chabad House had been attacked. Mumbai was under a coordinated terror attack on the night of November 26, 2008. Ten years later, what lessons have we learnt from the terror attack, coordinated from Rawalpindi with Pakistan’s rogue ISI directing operations to the 10 terrorists who came from Karachi to Mumbai by boat and inflatable rafts? Not enough. On the night of November 26, as soon as they received news of the terror attack, 250 elite National Security Guard (NSG) commandos were ready to fly to Mumbai. They were stationed at Manesar, Haryana. However, instead of reaching Mumbai by 2.00 am, the commandos arrived in the city only at 5.00 am. Their IL-76 aircraft wasn’t available at short notice — a grave security breach. Immediately after the 60-hour-long terror attack, spread over four days, had been neutralised and nine of the 10 Pakistani terrorists killed (the 10th, Ajmal Kasab, was caught, jailed, tried and hanged four years later in 2012), the Manmohan Singh government toyed with the idea of retaliating with a military strike on Pakistani territory. In the end, it did nothing. If a punitive strike had been launched on Pakistan immediately after the terror attack was contained, world opinion would have strongly backed India. Several foreigners, including American citizens, were killed in the attack on the Taj and Oberoi hotels. But the UPA1 government, counselled by national security advisor MK Narayanan and army chief Deepak Kapoor (who returned from South Africa on November 28), stepped back from a confrontation with Pakistan.  The decision would have serious consequences on India’s fight against terror over the next decade. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s faltering response was to replace Home Minister Shivraj Patil with Finance Minister P Chidambaram on December 1. Chidambaram had held the finance portfolio from 2004. Now, four years later as the new home minister, he set about revamping India’s anti-terror infrastructure. New NSG hubs were created around the country to ensure rapid movement of commandos during a terror attack. The Mumbai NSG hub  in June 2009. Hubs in Kolkata, Hyderabad and Chennai were established soon after. Today, nine years later, NSG commandos are better equipped to handle terror attacks like 26/11 — but both infrastructure and weaponry remain a concern. For example, only a basic firing range is in place in the Mumbai hub, which now has 500 NSG commandos. They still lack the state-of-the-art facilities they were promised. Both the UPA and NDA governments must bear responsibility for this lacuna. The attack on Mumbai, which killed 166 people and injured hundreds more, came from the sea. With its long coastline, the country’s financial capital remains vulnerable. As Sudhi Ranjan Sen    : “Then, as it is now, the Achilles’ heel of India’s coastal security remains small fishing boats, especially those under 20 metres long. Of the 280,000 odd-fishing boats registered across states in India, 220,000 fall in this category. “The 10 Pakistan-based terrorists involved in the 26/11 attacks hijacked Kuber, a small fishing trawler in the high sea, killed the captain, and sailed into Mumbai unchallenged. They then used inflatable rafts to land. Since then, all merchant and fishing vessels that are above 20 metres long are fitted with an ‘Automatic Identification System’ (AIS), a Global Positioning System-enabled friend or foe identification (mechanism)…” There are some life-changing events that stay etched in memory and prompt the question: where were you when it happened? The assassination of US President John F Kennedy, the assassinations of Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, the 9/11 terror attack on the twin towers of New York’s World Trade Centre — and now, 26/11, fall into this category. The morning after the 26/11 terror strike, on November 27, 2008, we sped along empty Mumbai roads, seeking access to the multi-location attacks. On day three of the attack, November 28, television camera crews were banked a few hundred metres from the Taj, then still under siege as NSG commandos went floor to floor, room to room, searching for the four Pakistani terrorists who had shot their way into the hotel 48 hours earlier. By the next day, November 29, nine of the ten terrorists in all locations — Taj, Oberoi and Chabad House — had been killed. Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, would say four years later to Ramesh Mahale, chief investigator in the case, as he was led from Arthur Road jail in Mumbai to Yerawada jail in Pune where he was to be hanged on November 21, 2012: “  (you won, I lost).” It was not the end though that India sought. Pakistan-sponsored terrorism continued:   and countless targets across Jammu and Kashmir. By 2012, Chidambaram had moved back from home to finance. Many of his initiatives, like the National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC), came to nothing. Lessons learned? Not many, certainly not enough. India remains a soft target. The trial to bring the Pakistani state handlers of Kasab and nine other terrorists to justice has long descended into farce in Pakistan’s subverted courts. Hafiz Saeed, patron of the Punjab-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), is a charitable and religious icon in Pakistan.  America’s bid to try the ISI’s General Ahmed Shuja Pasha for the killing of American citizens in the 26/11 terror attack   in US courts on the basis of sovereign immunity. The principal handler of the 26/11 attackers and top LeT commander working directly under the ISI, Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi, faced a deliberately sabotaged trial. The Pakistani prosecutors suppressed evidence and Lakhvi is out on bail, his trial for all practical purposes over. With Pakistan descending into a vortex of sectarian violence, the solution to cauterising crossborder terrorism lies within India. In 1997, then Prime Minister IK Gujral eroded India’s covert operational capabilities. The Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh and Modi governments have not reversed that erosion. As a result, India remains a vulnerable target, with few options to make Pakistan pay a price for its terrorism. Covert operations were one option in the 1990s. They no longer are. They must be rebuilt, along with all the other tactical weapons India now has, to inflict severe costs on Pakistan. The martyrs of 26/11 deserve that.",2018-11-25,"Ajmal Kasab,Pakistan,ISI,Mumbai terror attacks","Ten years after 26/11, can Mumbai be attacked again?",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/ten-years-after-26-11-mumbai-terror-attacks-isi-pakistan-ajmal-kasab/story/1/27976.html
78,Rajeev Dhavan,"One part of freedom of religion stems from free speech — the right to express, proclaim, celebrate and even propagate your faith in any way within the requirements of the public order, health and morality.

But in India, the living contradiction is that while the Constitution’s secular agenda is meant to apply to the state and public governance, its civil society is not secular, but deeply divided. This divides India. Given elections, the phantom menace of communalism abandons tolerance for political glory. The build-up in Ayodhya has strange antecedents. In the nineteenth century, the ‘chabutra’ was an act of trespass. The Nirmohi Akhara’s predecessor fought a civil case claiming title in 1885, but the Muslim claim to property was upheld, conceding prayer to Hindus. With the rise of the Hindu Mahasabha in 1934, the mosque was damaged and later repaired. In 1949, another trespass was paraded as a miracle. Opportunist officer Nayyar simply refused to obey orders from Centre and state. The ‘great’ Babri-Janmabhumi case began. The ‘lock’ incident of 1987 showed communal partiality across the political spectrum. Finally, the Babri Masjid was smashed on December 6, 1992 following rath yatras by Advani and Joshi, supported by the aspiring Modi. This was followed by Gujarat in 2002. There have been cow campaigns, ghar wapsi, murders, communal riots. Every Indian of any variety needs to ask: How can India survive this to create a society in which there is no freedom from fear from the state, political parties and civil society. All courtesy the British taxpayers. Amazing, no? One question immediately comes to mind: what about India? The present build-up in Ayodhya is massive: 1 lakh RSS, 1 lakh VHP, 500 sainiks. What is expected is an untidy pageant of 14,000 bikers, Jeeps, SUVs, buses and trains. From Varanasi 1,322 buses and 1,546 four-wheelers reportedly carried 80,000 persons. BJP MLA Surendra Singh has warned that as in 1992, the ‘crowd’ could take the law into its own hands. BJP Ravindra Khushwaha says a Bill for temple construction will be placed in Parliament on December 11, 2018. 
 
 The government cannot table or support such a Bill since it is the Supreme Court appointed statutory receiver. The Shiv Sena says: “ ”. The state government, headed by then-CM Kalyan Singh, could not protect the government. In the present assertions in 2018, the state has now organised seven paramilitary, police and 20 companies of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), and two RAF Companies. The town will be as in a state of siege, divided into eight zones and 16 sections, with barricades. 
 
 Is this free speech and the exercise of freedom of religion? As an unforgiving defender of free speech and plural diversity, I would support non-violent demonstrations of any kind. Free speech includes strong speech. But this build-up is more than that. It is not a celebration of faith, but coercive and intimidatory. The British answer lay in the ‘law or order’ state to prevent such demonstrations, ban, censor and separate and leave it at that. But the voice of secular togetherness is not just the concern of a fractured civil society. In the second, they must make it clear that they defend the rights of minorities. In one sense, they could use this neutrality politically. But thirdly, the positive obligations of secularism require positive assertions other than providing police, army and barricades. But CM Adityanath has gone well beyond his negative and positive obligations in changing names of towns like Allahabad and spending huge state money on the Kumbh mela — not just for safety but to advance the majoritarian faith of Hindus. Ayodhya and Sabarimala have set up challenges for India’s secularism. So far, the independent India has nationalised temples instead of leaving them in community hands, subject to temple entry for untouchables. The state’s duty should end in ensuring financial and health probity. This is what Justice Dipak Misra (as he then was) did in the Kalka temple case. It cannot and should not pronounce on issues of faith — not even the Supreme Court. We cannot totally go the way of French laïcité to prohibit any public expressions of faith, other than its concordat with church. The distinction between public and private religion endowments needs to be reworked. In India, it is not feasible or desirable to ban religions being celebrated publicly which, with secular sensitivity, other communities join in. But enjoying public space is one thing and using it to intimidate, coerce and embarrass others is contrary to bring the nation together. All this needs a rethink. Ayodhya’s controversies are sadly too one-sided. I feel that if Lord Ram had a say he would say: “Don’t build a temple for me. Just look after all people irrespective of their faith. That is the message of Ram Rajya.” (Courtesy of  )",2018-11-25,"Lok Sabha elections 2019,Ayodhya dispute,Babri Masjid,Ram Janmabhoomi",Why the build-up in Ayodhya today is not a celebration of faith,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/babri-masjid-ramjanmabhoomi-why-the-build-up-in-ayodhya-today-is-not-a-celebration-of-faith/story/1/27968.html
79,Aakash Mehrotra,"If we believe the verdict of the opinion polls, Madhya Pradesh is all set to see some tightly contested elections — and every trivial development could become a game changer. Political observers have already prophesied that these would be the toughest elections fought by Shivraj Singh. Learning from its earlier mistakes, the Congress, too, has busied itself in burying the differences among leaders, and presenting itself as a united house, and a credible alternative to the present government. A visit across the state is enough to tell that the BJP is on a sticky wicket this time, and anti-incumbency against the government and sitting MLAs will hit it hard. The last two years have seen many caste realignments, and coming up of caste groups, potent to sway the wind in one direction, and sail the other party to the winning line. One such development is the SAPAKS effect. Christened as Samanya, Pichda, Alpasankhayak (Sapaks), a brainchild of Hiralal Trivedi, SAPAKS is a political movement against reservation, which intensified after the SC/ST protests on the amendments in the SC/ST Act, and Shivraj Singh’s overt support to the status quo for the amendments. The movement mainly draws its energy from the  , which have been the pillars of the BJP’s unchallenged hegemony in the state politics for over a decade. On the lines of other socio movements like Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti (JAYS) for the tribal, SAPAKS is believed to have disturbed the equations for the ruling party. The idea of SAPAKS poses a bigger question of its viability, and to what extent it could hurt the prospects of the BJP. The movement has limited itself to the elite section of the upper castes, and specifically to the government employees, though it has raised many eyebrows. While the caste wars are heating up, the recent rally of the Brahmins in Ujjain got the BJP notice the SAPAKS. And this did make the BJP go on a course-correction mode with a series of steps to win back the Brahmin loyalty. It was a photograph that set Madhya Pradesh’s political circle abuzz — chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan meeting former BJP minister Laxmikant Sharma, a key accused in the Vyapam scam, in Vidisha in September. This was soon followed by his meetings with Anup Mishra, a forgotten Morena MP, and Rakesh Chaturvedi, a former Congressman. The meetings seemed like an action to neutralise the SAPAKS effect, which, if realised, would hurt the BJP the most in these elections. If political observations are to go by, the SAPAKS may not conjure up enough magic to win seats or split votes, but it could manage to create a political whirlpool for the BJP, by creating an atmosphere against the party among the upper caste, urban youth. SAPAKS has risen from disenchantment among upper castes against the stance of the BJP government, and this anti-BJP mood may not necessarily translate into pro-Congress mood. And SAPAKS could just add fuel to this mood, and may have varying implications — from swing of votes against the BJP to abstinence from voting. SAPAKS isn’t BJP’s only reason for worrying. The Rajput-dominated Karni Sena is also up in arms against the government. With the upper castes forming almost 17 per cent of the voter base, and Rajputs having a sizeable presence in the Mewar region, it spells bad news for the ruling party. These votes may not swing to the Congress side, as the grand old party has failed to take a firm stand on the aspirations of the upper caste, but it can still remain on comfortable grounds, if the core votes of the BJP get frittered. After the Supreme Court sought answers on the SC/ST amendments, which was largely seen as dilution of the Act, and made all parties come forth against it in unison, the Dalit-upper caste schism has widened in the state and led to violent protests by the upper castes. The stance gradually changed from 'against the instant arrests', as advocated in the SC/ST act, to 'anti-reservation'. The BJP soon found itself in the muddy waters, as it went overboard to show solidarity with the SC/ST, to retracing its stand to provide contestable legitimacy to a dubious sense of victimhood among the upper castes. But assurances don’t live long in Indian politics. The BJP’s desperation to hold voter bases, in an election seen as the toughest in decades, saw it swinging from one side to the other. The gambit, however, is fraught with the risk of it losing credibility among both the groups. The rise and rise of caste-cum-ideological groups like JAYS and SAPAKS speak of that fear turning into harsh reality for the ruling party. The 2013 state elections and then the 2014 general elections were significant because of their political readings. The upper castes and the OBCs have been the BJP’s traditional voter base, while the SC/STs have preferred to vote for the Congress. However, this pattern changed in 2013 when the BJP gained 36 per cent SC votes in comparison to 31 per cent in 2008, and then 46 per cent in 2014 elections. The party also managed to increase its voteshare among the ST, with securing 54 per cent of the ST vote, which traditionally went to the Congress. Since 2017, the BJP has seen the tides change, with consistently losing its gain among the SC/ST votes. As pointed in my previous article,  , the BJP had lost almost 13 basis points, and the Congress gained 16 basis points, among the two groups. With such significant shifts in votes, any loss in its core votes only adds to the worries of the saffron party. For now, the saffron party may feel content in the fact that every anti-BJP vote may not turn into pro-congress vote, but what it seems that the caste conundrum has got the BJP caught between a rock and a hard place.",2018-11-25,"Assembly elections 2018,Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections,Congress,BJP",Madhya Pradesh is caught in a caste whirlpool: Which party stands to lose the most,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/madhya-pradesh-is-caught-in-a-caste-whirlpool-which-party-stands-to-lose-the-most/story/1/27975.html
80,Mehr Tarar,"Aasia bibi is released. And Khadim Hussain Rizvi is arrested. This is the Pakistan I never thought I’d see in my lifetime. This is the Pakistan of which Imran Khan is the prime minister. The politician who was labelled a fundamentalist, Khan is walking the talk. He is doing what is right, the way forward, to be the change that he promised he would be, doing his best to make Pakistan the country that is not just prosperous and peaceful but also respects the law, is fair and does not practise appeasement of extremism. The October 31 Supreme Court verdict to release the poor Christian woman Aasia bibi, a death sentence prisoner, based on a thorough legal review of her case, unleashed a reaction that was expected yet very ugly, with all the makings of a nation-wide anarchic situation if not controlled in time. The few-day protests that erupted in many areas of Pakistan were orchestrated on the call of Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the leader of the religious organisation Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). In what was said to be governmental capitulation to an extremist group that threatened to hold Pakistan hostage if its demand to revoke the Aasia bibi verdict was not met, an agreement was signed between the government and Rizvi’s organisation. Protests ended but the threat of more protests loomed constant and ominous in the non-fulfilment of his demands related to Aasia bibi case: court review of the verdict and placement of Aasia bibi on the Exit Control List. On November 23, after arrests of many members of TLP, the news of Rizvi’s arrest was made public. Pakistan, mostly, lauded the action of the Punjab police that took place on the order of the Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar. In Punjab, Khan’s party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf is in power, and Buzdar is the little-known, unassuming and low-key PTI politician suddenly catapulted into the most important position in the biggest province of Pakistan. Buzdar with the silent yet firm crackdown on TLP showed that actions speak louder than words. On a day that was marked by the horrific tragedy of the killing of 32 plus people in a blast in the Orakzai district, and four people, including two police officials, in a terrorist attack on the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, the news of Rizvi’s arrest came as a reminder that things despite being awful are changing in the Khan-governed Pakistan. As the nation paid tributes to the people martyred in the two attacks, there was also the non-stop appreciation of the operation in Karachi led by the very courageous ASP Suhai Aziz Talpur of the Sindh police. Much is to be done, much is being done. That is how a country facing a huge economic crisis and many other issues must be prepared to function — steadily, without stopping. Pakistan does not have any time to waste as every day is a new challenge, and each challenge must be dealt with in the best way possible. As Pakistan mourns its martyrs and salutes its heroes, the realistic assessment of the what and why must never be lost focus of. A thorough investigation of the two terror attacks of varying intensity in two different parts of Pakistan is needed to prevent the same kind of destruction in future. The number of acts of terrorism due to the collaborative efforts of government, army, law enforcement and intelligence agencies has been substantially reduced, and whereas it can be said that terrorism cannot be completely eliminated, no effort must be spared to fight it on all levels. Prime Minister Khan tweeted: “I am absolutely clear both these attacks are part of a planned campaign to create unrest in the country by those who do not want Pakistan to prosper. Let there be no doubt in anyone’s mind that we will crush the terrorists, whatever it takes.” 
 
 In the backdrop of a geopolitical history that is marked with much that is negative, Pakistan takes another positive step. Khan’s government is going ahead with India’s agreement to Pakistan’s offer to open the Kartarpur corridor for the easy passage of Sikh pilgrims for the 550th birth anniversary in 2019 of the Shri Guru Nanak Devji. Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on behalf of Khan’s government has extended an invitation to India’s external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu to attend the groundbreaking ceremony at Kartarpur on November 28. Minister Swaraj while RSVP’ing her regrets citing her earlier commitment on the day of the event accepted the invitation on India’s behalf. Mrs Harsimat Kaur Badal and former ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri will represent India. 
 
 
 
 
 
 After three months of his swearing-in, amidst relentless antagonism from political parties in opposition and biased media reportage, what is clear is the agenda of Imran Khan’s government: formation of a Pakistan that is future-focused, self-reliant, progressive, peaceful, corruption-free, and fair and good to its people. There are errors, there are bad decisions, there are some inefficient people on positions of importance, and there are some slips of tongue or careless utterances. What is also there: constant and strict course correction. The government is new, it is untested, it has five years to prove itself, and it has a new test every day. What makes it different beyond that: it is Imran Khan’s government. What makes Khan different from most previous rulers of Pakistan — civilian prime ministers and military dictators — is that despite appearing to be self-centred and a follower of me-myself-and-I school of thought, Khan is anything but that. At 66, in his first term as the prime minister of Pakistan that he owes his everything to, he is determined to make it into a country that he along with his 200 million compatriots would be proud to call their homeland. Security of life, quality healthcare, solid education, effective law and order, a fair and impartial legal and judicial system that is for all, affordable housing for the underprivileged, employment opportunities, conducive environment for business, enhanced tourism, and mutually beneficial bilateral relations with countries in the region and outside is inclusive in Khan’s vision of a model social welfare state of 2018 based on the principles of the 7th century Medina. Some of Khan’s ideas might not be new; what is new is they will turn into reality with him as the prime minister. There is no political dynasty that Khan has to protect or leave his chair for; there are no financial stakes in any business within and outside Pakistan; there is no unaccounted wealth spread around the world in palatial houses, unknown companies and untraceable accounts. What Khan is and what Khan has is all about Pakistan, and is in Pakistan. And that is what makes the flawed, human and very real Khan the one-of-a-kind leader. The kind of leader Pakistan needs today and tomorrow. The leader that is trusted by his own people, and is respected by people and leaders of other countries. The leader with whom the 92-year-old Malaysian First Lady has her adorable admiration moment; the very lovely Ma’am Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali, accompanied by her husband Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, was beaming as Khan shyly laughed and held her hand on her request. 
 
 Why I believe in Khan to do the right thing is based on my idealism for humanity and Pakistan, and that is what I see in Prime Minister Khan. While I, as a stay-at-home writer, am not in a material position to do much for people, Khan as the prime minister of the country is, and that is what I see him doing every day. Moved by the photo of a poor man and his three children sleeping on a road, Khan instructed the building of shelters for the homeless and the needy. On November 24, he tweeted: “I have asked CM Punjab to set up tents for people sleeping on footpaths and provide them food until the Panah Gahs (shelters) are built, as the weather is turning increasingly cold. Peshawar and Karachi spots also being located.” 
 
 It may be trivial for many, for me it is huge. I don’t usually see this empathy, this concern, this humanity and this pain for the poor in the words, tweets and actions of many heads of state. He who notices the pain of one family sleeping on the road is my hero. And I’m happy and grateful that he is the prime minister of the Pakistan I love and call home. Thank you, Prime Minister, Imran Khan.  ",2018-11-25,"Kartarpur corridor,PTI,Pakistan,Imran Khan","Aasia bibi released, opening of Kartarpur corridor: This is how Imran Khan's Naya Pakistan looks like",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aasia-bibi-verdict-opening-of-katarpur-corridor-this-is-how-imran-khan-s-naya-pakistan-looks-like/story/1/27967.html
81,Kumar Kunal,"Chilli powder or mirchi is normally used in Indian curries to add flavour and piquancy. Of late, the same chilli powder is spicing up politics in Delhi. Following an attack at   on Tuesday, when the alleged attacker threw chilli powder at him just outside his office in Delhi secretariat, a fresh political blame game has ensued among political parties — especially between the The incident has thrown the high security zone of Delhi secretariat into a tizzy. The Chief Minister’s office on the third floor of the Delhi Secretariat is an area where security is so tight that even mediapersons are not allowed to enter the premises before 3pm every day as per government’s guidelines. The security of the Delhi Secretariat is the responsibility of Delhi Police, which functions under the jurisdiction of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Due to this reason, the attention immediately shifted from the security lapse to a suspected political motive behind the attack.  Minutes after the incident took place, the Aam Aadmi party called the attack a political conspiracy to  . The party has accused the Delhi Police under the Central government of acting at the Centre’s behest. The AAP has even claimed that no 'attacker' can enter the CMO without the knowledge the police, let alone meeting Kejriwal and throwing chilli powder at him. In a way, the AAP has declared the Delhi Police as the chief conspirator. Hence, the focus has immediately shifted from the real attack and the alleged attacker to the perceived political conspiracy and the alleged agency behind it. Even though the Delhi Police claimed to have provided foolproof security to the Delhi CM, it was not for the first time that such attacks have taken place on Kejriwal. Earlier, the Delhi CM has been attacked both in and outside Delhi, but never in his office premises. So, this time around, the attack looks more serious and a bigger security lapse has come to the fore, as far as the working of Delhi Police is concerned. Questions have been also raised over the precautions taken by the security agencies after attacks on the CM in the past. Although it's difficult to come to the conclusion if a bigger political controversy was behind the attack, one thing is quite clear — had proper security checks been in place, the incident could have been easily avoided.   While the Aam Aadmi Party accused the BJP of conspiring the attack, the BJP government at the Centre has rubbished all claims. Interestingly, even though the BJP initially condemned the incident, some of its party leaders have called it a   to bring Kejriwal back into the limelight. The BJP has also pointed out the promptness with which the AAP cried a political conspiracy, which remains unfounded so far. BJP's Delhi president Manoj Tiwari went on to claim that it was not chilli powder but some other ""scented powder"" placed by AAP leaders to stage an attack. Meanwhile, the alleged attacker Anil Kumar Sharma's social media profile has revealed that he was had been posting messages against the Delhi CM for some time now. So the posts and the statements made to the media after the attack on Chief Minister, conclusively proved that   on him since long. The motive behind the attack, in all probability, was personal which could be influenced by a certain political ideology that is against the policies of Kejriwal and his party. But that still doesn't discount the fact that the attack was a huge security lapse, even if not a political conspiracy as alleged by the AAP. With the 2019 Lok Sabha elections drawing nearer and Arvind Keriwal expected to travel across the country for poll campaigning, adequate security must be provided to the Delhi CM who has faced several attacks in the past as well.",2018-11-22,"BJP,Delhi secretariat,Chilli powder attack,Arvind Kejriwal",What could be the real motive behind the chilli powder attack on Arvind Kejriwal?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/what-could-be-the-real-motive-behind-chilli-powder-attack-on-arvind-kejriwal/story/1/27940.html
82,Ashutosh Mishra,"The 2010 Amir Khan-produced   was a sensation — but not many know about the village the movie was based on. The village, called Sehra, is located about 200 km from Bhopal, the capital of poll-bound Madhya Pradesh. I travelled to the village as part of our election coverage and interacted with its residents — including the real-life Natha.   The character of Natha was based on Kunjilal Malviya. He comes from a family of astrologers, and at the age of 75, had predicted his own death. Though he did not die, his dramatic prediction hit national headlines. Seven years later, Khan made a movie on the subject. Locals recall the time in 2003 when the whole village was flooded with outsiders, curious about whether Kunjilal’s prediction would come true. Kunjilal is 90 today. Age has made him frail, but he is still actively interested in the politics of the state. He never watched  Kunjilal is quite happy with Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who, he says, has improved the lot of not just Sehra, but their entire district of Betul. The reasons for Kunjilal’s admiration are not hard to see. The village has primary schools, and there is a high school nearby. The state highway leading to Sehra from Betul is well-maintained. Electricity supply to Sehra is regular, it has a primary health care centre, and a bigger state-run hospital is not far-off. But not everyone is as happy. Many inhabitants of the village have major grievances. Parashuram dada, 78, says that for the past several polls, politicians from the BJP and the Opposition parties have been making the same promises. “Every election, we are told farm loans will be waived and the village will get drinking water. We are still waiting for either promise to be fulfilled,” he says.   The villagers’ ire, however, is directed more at their local MLA rather than CM Chouhan. The locals say that after winning the Betul seat in 2013, their MLA, BJP’s Hemant Khandelwal has not visited the village even once. “When we go to his house or office to seek help, we are told the MLA is in Bhopal, Delhi, the USA,” says Anuj, a villager. The need for farm relief is apparent. Ramkishor, a farmer, says: “My family and I toil the whole day, but barely manage two square meals. For the past three years, we have been unable to even recover the input costs of farming, and are therefore forced to keep borrowing from banks.” Youngsters have other concerns. Deepak, pursuing a BSc degree, and Santosh, enrolled in a BCA course, are apprehensive about ever landing a job. According to the duo, barely 10% of the youth in the village have found jobs. They believe Chouhan has neglected the problem of unemployment, and hence, they want a change of guard this time. But arguably, the most acute problem in the village is the shortage of drinking water. Women spend long hours queued up in front of the lone tubewell. Children have to miss school to help ferry water. Even that tubewell gets water supply only on alternate days. Things will only get worse. Lakshmi Hukum Singh says: “The pipe will dry up by the end of February or the first week of March. Then the real trouble will begin. Children will be forced to walk for kilometres, carrying water.” Many in the village believe the state government has come up with schemes to help them, but the benefits did not reach them because of the failure and ignorance of the local political leadership and the local administration. Thus, even though the CM himself is not too unpopular, the lackluster performance of the local MLA seems to have turned many against his party. The villagers have once again been promised a lot before this election — it remains to be seen whose words they will buy this time.",2018-11-22,"BJP,Peepli Live,Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Madhya pradesh elections","In the MP village that inspired ‘Peepli Live’, a trailer of the election ahead",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/madhya-pradesh-elections-shivraj-singh-chouhan-peepli-live-bjp-farm-distress-unemployment/story/1/27939.html
83,Sudarshan Ramabadran,"India‘s President Ram Nath Kovind is midway through a significant trip to two important Indo-Pacific countries, namely Vietnam and Australia. His visit to Vietnam has been his first to an ASEAN country since assuming office. It has also come soon after the election of Vietnamese President Trong, which happened in October 2018. What is very significant is the fact that President Kovind began his visit from Da Nang, a place believed to have a rich historical and civilisational connection with India. Da Nang is famous for its world heritage site My Son, which is the origin and home of the Hindu Cham civilisation — which dates back 2000 years — and the ancient temples of their people, constructed by the kings of Champa between the 4th and 13th centuries AD, which also have Buddhist connections. This further strengthens its ties to India, considering that Buddhism originated in the Indian subcontinent, as President Kovind also pointed out. The Cham community is one of 50 ethnic groups living in and around the margins of Vietnam, and they share distinct characteristics with Indians. In fact, a documentary on India and Southeast Asia produced by India’s Ministry of External Affairs has stated that the Cham community also have part Tamil ancestry. 
 
 
 
 The importance of the visit to My Son cannot be missed as it is one of the foremost Hindu heritage sites of Southeast Asia. As per UNSECO, “The My Son Sanctuary is an exceptional example of cultural interchange, with an indigenous society adapting to external cultural influences, notably the Hindu art and architecture of the Indian sub-continent. The Champa Kingdom was an important phenomenon in the political and cultural history of South East Asia, vividly illustrated by the ruins of My Son.” In fact, some more research-driven audio-visual documentaries about My Son also state that there were more than 70 temples at the site, with inscriptions in Sanskrit and Cham. There are also details which state that a large number of the inscriptions allude to and describe interesting historical events, such as the then on-going wars between Champa and Cambodia in the 12th century. Most of My Son’s architecture was destroyed by the US during the Vietnam War. Interestingly, My Son is the only place in Vietnamese history without the influence of the US or France. Indeed, a great start to President Kovind’s visit, and one which marks the kindred spirit and emotional link shared between the two countries, as well as a deep cultural connect. Slowly but surely, India has begun effective projection of her soft power symbols in Southeast Asia. Currently, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is helping Vietnam in the preservation and conservation of some of the temples there. To this effect, funds are released through the Ministry of External Affairs as part of India’s diplomatic outreach to such nations, with the ASI, under the Ministry of Culture, is the implementing agency. This type of work can go on for decades and is often monitored by third-party agencies such as the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. In 2010, as part of an India-Vietnam cultural exchange programme, a two-member ASI team visited Vietnam to make a preliminary assessment of the task to conserve the Cham monuments, including the UNESCO World Heritage My Son group of temples. A memorandum of understanding was signed in October 2014 and execution of the project began with three groups of temples. It’s definitely high time that we have detailed research of Hindu temples in Vietnam, and of their idols and structures. After all, Southeast Asia holds an integral part of the destiny of Hinduism. As per a research paper by the Center on Globalisation, Governance and Competitiveness of the Duke University, “Tourism has become an essential and fast-growing economic activity and it accounts for about 45 per cent of service exports in developing countries.” The paper goes on to attribute that “Vietnam has already had success in offering MICE (Meetings Incentives Conventions and Exhibitions) products in addition to its more well-known cultural tourism offerings.” The President’s visit could reignite, or rather is a gentle reminder for tour operators that enabling tourism in a substantive manner through a focussed approach by tapping into sites such as My Son, is the way forward. One of Vietnam’s former Deputy Prime Ministers, Vu Khoan, once famously asserted that, “The depth of diplomacy is culture.” What is also discernible is the vast reach of Buddhism, the flourishing and dominant religion in Southeast Asia — a common socio-cultural and religious thread. In fact, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations has established several chairs related to India in countries abroad, and there are several of them in universities in ASEAN countries. Back to Vietnam, the visit of the President of India has had other highlights too. In a heart-warming gesture, students from the Vietnam National University, along with Indian embassy staff and their spouses, came together to sing the Hindi movie song, “Yeh dosti hum nahin todenge” (we will not break this friendship) from the popular movie  , for the Indian president and his wife, Savita Kovind. Music is not the only way to the President’s heart, who didn’t miss an opportunity to later tweet about Vietnamese cuisine and coffee, commenting on the fact that both are growing in popularity in India. He highlighted that Indians are popularly known to be tea drinkers; quite a testimony for the quality of coffee produced by Vietnam! 
 
 While drawing attention to the parallels between both countries, President Kovind noted that India and Vietnam both have a special year coming up, as 2019 marks the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi as well as the 50th anniversary since the passing away of Ho Chi Minh. Both are considered fathers and catalysts of change in their respective nations. Ho Chi Minh and Vietnam are popular in India, especially in West Bengal where the famous chant ‘Amar Naam, Tumar Naam, Vietnam, Vietnam’ was earlier heard. The words have deep imprints and are recalled even to date. President Kovind also referred to the deep connection between the two countries by tweeting, “The people-to-people network between Vietnam and India – an inheritor of one of the oldest people-to-people networks in Asia and the Indo-Pacific – is the foundation and the edifice of our partnership.” In the book,   edited by Shyam Saran, the long-standing historical ties between India and the ASEAN region were determined by the nautical narratives of India. In one of the chapters titled,   the author, Le Thi Lien writes that, “trade along the sea and river systems played a vital role in cementing ties between India and Vietnam, mainly along the river systems, including goods such as metal ingots, gemstones, shell, carnelian, fine pottery, etc.” For millennia, Indians have believed in the power of civilisation and that has been a key aspect of Indian identity. This very premise has given Indians a sense of belonging, inclusion, and loyalty. The country’s bilateral relations and foreign policies have also been determined by alluding to the relevance of civilisational ties. The focus has been on that which connects, which is always a healthy focus to have. India’s meaningful steps in harnessing these civilisational connects are what truly distinguishes Indian soft power. This by no means is an imposition with strategically important countries like Vietnam and other ASEAN countries. The visit of President Kovind to culturally significant places like My Son was welcomed by the people of both countries, and it also reaffirms that India is no longer reticent to exhibit to the world that she is serious about harnessing these soft power tools.",2018-11-22,"Foreign policy,Vietnam,Ram Nath Kovind,My son","How the Indian President, Ram Nath Kovind's visit to ‘My Son’ in Vietnam is a symbol of soft power",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/indian-president-ram-nath-kovind-my-son-sanctuary-vietnam-foreign-policy/story/1/27921.html
84,Soumyadipta Banerjee,"I can say with some confidence that the   at the hands of senior leaders of the Congress party more or less shaped my political opinion during my teenage days. At the time of the incident, I was a boy who had just passed his school finals. I was still in my teens and like many junior college students in West Bengal, I had an active interest in political affairs. I used to take part in political discussions among my small peer group and I'd dare say that almost everybody in my peer group used to agree that the Congress wasn’t a party worth our support. I say a 'very small peer group' because I grew up in communist Bengal, where the atmosphere was always politically highly charged. We were a miniscule group of people who used to think that despite the communists claiming that they were a labour-friendly party, they had only acted as a fillip to the misfortune of factory workers as factories increasingly downed their shutters in the state while many Left leaders continued to render lip service before the media. ""My dear comrade, first decide whether you are with Russia or China,"" we would say joking about our communist friends who supported the CPI(M) in West Bengal, as many even among the senior CPI(M) leadership didn't know the difference between the communism practised in China vis-a-vis Russia and the clear ideological differences between the two of them. The only poor and distant alternative to the communists in Bengal during 1997-1998 was the Congress (I). When I was in school, I was used to seeing PV Narasimha Rao's face as the Prime Minister of India on television and in newpapers. I also remember that for a brief period of time, it was Sitaram Kesri who was in the spotlight despite him not being a great orator. This was also when my political consciousness was taking shape. I was a schoolboy when the country saw the brutal killing of Rajiv Gandhi and I didn’t see another Gandhi ‘assume’ power till I was on my way to Class 12. It was the Sitaram Kesri incident that weaned me away from the Congress party forever. The way Kesri was removed from power said a lot about how the Congress is a party which is destined to be controlled by one family alone. The incident was pretty straightforward and was played out in the media for a long time afterwards. After staying out of active politics and after an electoral loss to the BJP in 1998, Sonia Gandhi finally agreed to step into active politics. But Kesri, who enjoyed huge popularity in the party at that time, apparently didn't want to relinquish the presidency of the party. He hadn't stepped down, despite a resolution to that effect from the party. What followed was unprecedented in the history of the Congress. As there was some indication that he might oppose the move when Sonia Gandhi would assume office as the president of the party, he was allegedly   for hours till Sonia Gandhi formally assumed office as the party president. Someone had reportedly bolted the door from outside when Kesri went in. He was then asked to leave and escorted out of the party office. Kesri was 82 years old when he was subjected to this humiliation. The same incident is believed to have led to some very senior Congress leaders, including Sharad Pawar, PA Sangma and Tariq Anwar, walking out of the party, and the subsequent formation of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) as it would definitely made senior leaders feel vulnerable within the Congress fold. This is the  during an election rally in Chhattisgarh recently.  
 
 The chain of incidents affected me to a level that I could never believe in Congress ideals. Till date, I have never agreed with the repeated Congress claims that the top posts of the party are for top performers and not for the dynasty's yes-men. In my teenage mind, I could never fathom why an 82-year-old man and so many senior leaders were denied the voice that they had, despite remaining dedicated to the party for decades. There were many other incidents that followed which drew me away from the Congress party – but the biggest shock was yet to come. It was the  . Rao’s mortal remains were reportedly not allowed inside the gates of the Congress headquarters, a standard practice followed after the death of senior leaders by most political parties.

85,Sandip Ghose,"If there was a way to measure the AQI (air quality index) of the political atmosphere, it would probably turn out to be more  . One has not seen a more vitiated climate in the run-up to major elections in recent memory. In the past, the mood of the electorate used to remain trapped at ground-level. Now, thanks to the advent of social media, there is a heavy overhang of political smog — impairing clear vision. These are not ordinary times. This is the age of post-truth, when neither politicians, nor the media want facts to come in the way of the narrative they wish to peddle. Thus, half-truths and selective memory form the discourse. There are no saints here. All sides are equally guilty of muddying the waters. Fault lines are drawn all over. It is not just in the media, which is sharply divided and becoming blatantly partisan by the day. Social media was always polarised. It has only become more vicious. Fissures are visible even in social circles — sometimes within families too. Our political conversation has been sliding downhill for quite some time now. To be fair, the phenomenon is not restricted to India alone. One sees it playing out in the West too. Most notably in the US. Though Modi is no Donald Trump, the liberals in India tend to blame him solely for the descent. Rahul Gandhi is seen to be only squaring his 2014 account with Modi by cornering him on  The BJP came to power on the plank of corruption charges against the Congress. But, in nearly five years, there has been no  . That puts Modi and the BJP on a weak wicket to make corruption an issue again. Besides, as for the ruling party in most states going for elections, the shoe is on the proverbial other foot. The incumbent party is always at the receiving end. So,  are having to fall back on pouring vitriol over the Gandhi family legacy. How far this is working with the voters will be known only after December 11. But, for sure, it is triggering more toxins in the system. And, just like the murky weather of Delhi, there are no signs of respite. If the BJP has a grand plan to change the wind direction, it is not clear. At the moment things are not looking bright for the BJP. It seems to have only three cards up its sleeve. They are —Modi, Modi and Modi. But, as the unmistakable tired look on his face during the recent rallies indicate, the strain is beginning to tell on the Prime Minister. There are three factors constraining Modi from going for the jugular now. Modi is well-known for his sense of timing. But he seems to have faltered on at least two of the three. First, there is a widely accepted view that  . If the “bad news” had been dealt with early in the innings, he would have been in a better place today. There can be many counterfactual arguments as to why he could not have done it earlier. He had to win major state elections, especially Uttar Pradesh before taking hard calls. Besides, he needed to up the  , without which important legislations were being scuttled by the opposition. Having to backtrack on the land reforms bill was a major setback — and after the   jibe, it became a case of once bitten, twice shy. As a result, Modi had to exhaust disproportionate political capital over  without leaving enough time for him to recover the spent goodwill. Perhaps an even bigger lapse in hindsight was not replacing the old guard in the states. It is only natural that after three terms, both Raman Singh and Shivraj Singh Chauhan would have accumulated heavy credit on the liability side of their individual political balance sheets. That  stock was going down in Rajasthan was an open secret. The popular conjecture is, Modi could not take those calls due to internal party dynamics. Moving such heavyweight leaders would have meant accommodating them in important ministries at the Centre. That would have posed a different challenge, which he may not have liked to take up so soon after assuming premiership. Finally, a lot is being said and written about how Modi was let down by the bureaucracy and his own team. This is inexplicable. Because Modi’s strongest credentials were that of a corporate CEO-style administrator. Much of that sheen was taken off by the execution failures of demonetisation and GST. Some of the best social welfare schemes have not reaped commensurate mileage due to slow implementation. But now, the image of a man in control has been further dented by the  . It gives the impression of a loose grip — uncharacteristic for a leader known to be always in control. It is clear that the Opposition has repeatedly tried to used the higher judiciary to waylay the government on sensitive issues, starting from the National Judicial Appointments Commission ( to  . Many feel the government yielded a lot of undeserved face-time to its detractors, which could have been better managed. As a result of these distractions, attention has shifted from the many genuine achievements of the government on multiple fronts. For example, the work done on financial inclusion and digitisation of the economy has been phenomenal, as recounted by the Prime Minister at the  . This is acknowledged globally. There has undoubtedly been progress on the  front for all to see. But critics only cherry-pick the apparent failures. Over the last few quarters, the  . But the good news gets drowned in vituperative campaign crossfire and needless cacophony over a classical concert. The opposition accuses that the Prime Minister thinks he can do no wrong. Similarly, it can be said that according to the Opposition, Narendra Modi can do nothing right. But, just as 60 years of Congress rule could not have been a washout, five years of NDA government cannot be written off either. Modi will be able to convince the people that he has made an honest start — and needs another term to finish the task. Equally, the Opposition will need to inspire confidence that they have a genuine alternative to offer beyond just a “Modi hatao” agenda. Ultimately, it is for the people who will judge. To arrive at an informed decision, they need to see the full picture.

86,Aneesha Mathur,"The   mess is getting murkier by the day, and Tuesday saw a new stone being thrown into the already muddied pond. The Chief Justice of India asked the petitioners, including ""deposed"" CBI director Alok Verma, why information regarding the confidential CVC probe was “ ”, and why serious allegations against senior government functionaries were “splashed all over the media.” The court also noted that it wanted to maintain the confidentiality of the probe, “to preserve the dignity and respect of the institution” that is the CBI, but the petitioners were violating the court’s efforts. Worryingly, the CJI has also commented that the SC is “not a platform for anyone to come and express whatever... this is a place for adjudication of legal issues,” and added that “we intend to set this right.” Speculations abound on what form this “setting right” will take. Does this mean stricter controls on the media? Senior lawyer and “respected jurist” Fali S Nariman squarely blamed the leak on “everyone wanting to know this and that,” and questioned the “irresponsible media”. A few minutes later, after actually reading the article in question, and possibly speaking to his clients, Nariman backed down and accepted that there was no “leak” of sealed information, and the report was based on information that was “not sealed”. The court has also raised a red flag about MK Sinha’s application being “splashed all over the media” a day after the court declined to give an urgent hearing. Legal reporting usually is based on documents, particularly petitions become “public documents” once they are filed and listed for hearing. Do we as reporters now need to fear that if we publish a petition that has been brought before the court, it may draw the ire of the judiciary? Thousands of petitions get reported in the media but get dismissed from the courts. The only thing that a publication does, is start a public debate by informing the people that such and such issue has been raised. On one hand, it may be seen as a last-ditch effort by the Supreme Court to plug the leaks and have a hearing on the legal question raised by the various petitions that have been filed. Alok Verma’s plea has raised the spectre of undue interference by the government and violation of the clear laws put in place to preserve and isolate the position of the CBI Director from executive influence. The legal issue before the court is of whether the CVC decision to send Verma on “extended leave” and appoint ""an interim director"" reached beyond its power as the Supervisory authority and conscience keeper. However, as the various pleas and counter-allegations are coming out in the open, the deeper rot in the “system” is being rapidly exposed and is becoming the focal point of political mudslinging and media debate. The court has repeatedly said that it does not want the politics of it all to be bought into legal proceedings, but the hearing on Tuesday has allowed fingers to be pointed at the Supreme court itself. Social media is rife with people asking why a CJI, who as the senior-most Judge of the Supreme Court, was part of the infamous “Judges Press Conference” earlier this year, would object to the dirty linen of the probe agency being washed in public. If the Judiciary could place its differences before the court of public opinion, then why quibble about the “dignity” of the CBI, which had famously been labelled as a “caged parrot” by a Supreme Court judge for botching important investigations. On the other side is the issue that “hearsay” allegations are being spread by all sides, instead of concrete evidence that can be taken on record. As observed by Justice SK Kaul on Tuesday, “it is difficult to adjudicate such cases where everyone seems to be snooping on everyone else.” This comment seems to indicate that the allegations raised in various complaints are based on phone taps and surveillance. According to reports, this surveillance, particularly of senior government officials, may have been illegal and unauthorised.  Where does this leave the much-vaunted right to privacy and our legal holy grail of due process? How much of the alleged “records” are even true? Particularly as there is no documentation being shown to the court, only allegations being raised. What has come on record is the fact that there is a deep-rooted malaise in the CBI and the bureaucratic system of the country.  The response of Alok Verma to the CVC questionnaire, which was reported in   and drew the anger of the SC, also indicates the kind of walls that are being put up in a system that allows personal opinions and favours to manipulate sensitive investigations. Verma has claimed that his objections and complaints have been “ignored” by the CVC since officials including the DoPT and PMO have been “favouring” Asthana and brewing “indiscipline” in the investigative agency. Asthana in his plea before the Supreme Court and the High court has claimed that he is being “targeted” for opposing Verma and attempting to expose corruption in the agency. Who is telling the truth and who is bending the truth is something that only a detailed investigation and trial will reveal. Unfortunately, with fingers being pointed at the top officers of virtually every branch of the government’s investigative and supervisory framework, WHO will conduct this investigation is yet unanswered. The ""caged parrot"" is singing at the top of its voice. It's up to us all to make sense of what it is saying.",2018-11-21,"Judiciary,Rakesh asthana,Alok verma,CBI",Why the SC is angry over media's role in the CBI turf war,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sc-cbi-alok-verma-rakesh-asthana-judiciary/story/1/27905.html
87,Arindam De,"Elections can be won even if a party gets its math wrong, but it is a mighty tough job. Mere calculations don’t win you elections — it has to be backed up by political sense and awareness of the situation on ground.  The Karnataka have encouraging signs for Congress. Only signs. However, in the run-up to the General Elections, such signals are invaluable. The Congress-JD(S) combine bagged two Assembly and two Lok Sabha seats, making it 4 in their favour against BJP’s 1. The result reflects how a pre-poll alliance during the Assembly elections could have probably turned out to be. The keywords here are maturity and flexibility. Maturity — in the ability to play second fiddle to strong, like-minded regional players — and flexibility — the ability of Congress to sit down and strike separate, not necessarily different, deals with various regional parties, who have their own local agenda and vote bank. Regardless of the success or failure of the proposed non-BJP, non-Congress front in uniting, the Congress must try and act as the gel that binds these parties together. For, each of these parties, in the 2019 General Elections, could bring a substantial number of seats to the negotiation table. Yes, you may term such tie-ups opportunistic, but that is what they are intended to be. Because as far as organisational strength and cadre base are concerned, the Congress cannot even compare itself with the election machinery of the BJP, let alone take on the entire NDA combine, which should see the addition of a few potent partners ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.  The only hope, then, is the local strength of regional parties. Karnataka provided just a glimpse of how things could turn out — a score of 4-1, the fortress of Ballary breached, not allowing BJP to wrest any seat from the Congress-JD(S) strongholds. If you take a look at the voting patterns, the INC-JD(S) combine won with resounding margins, and in the seat they lost, the combine was able to bring down the margin of victory substantially.  The verdict could also be touted as a vote of confidence on the coalition government in the state. A bit of political maturity would have saved the political drama that Karnataka saw post polls, and the coalition would have been in a far more comfortable position. The BJP has time and again targeted the “weak” coalition, but so far seems unable to have convinced the voters about it. Hopefully, the ruling coalition in the state keeps things simple and continues preparations for the General Elections. Beyond Karnataka, there has been some movement towards stitching up anti-BJP fronts in states like Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The AP CM Chandrababu Naidu   to engage opposition leaders. Although, how potent would Chandrababu prove to be in Andhra Pradesh or as a deal maker, remains to be seen. As things stand, hectic parleys have resulted in some positive bytes, but little else. Early next week, the Opposition leaders  . Chandrababu will meet Mamata Banerjee separately before the proposed opposition unity meeting. The outcome could be crucial. Although Congress has long lost the political primacy it was used to in national politics, it can still work as a fulcrum, a pivot. Provided, it can engage and adapt. It will not be all smooth sailing. BSP chief Mayawati, for example, has cried off a coalition in the ongoing state Assembly elections. That may have damaging repercussions for Congress, at least in Chhattisgarh. Whether a SP-BSP tie up will take place in Uttar Pradesh is still unclear. What is clear is that such a coalition would substantially increase their seat tally. Substantially — but not dramatically. That is because even socialist parties rely on the politics of caste and while the BSP vote may transfer to the SP, it may not happen as smoothly the other way round. Then there is the looming Ram Mandir issue. No political party in India will position itself against Lord Ram. For anything to click, the Congress must hope that it scores a 3-2 in the ongoing Assembly elections — at least A 2-1 in the big three, where the anti-incumbency factor favours the party. Unless that happens, the Congress will find it extremely difficult to convince people or allies that it is worth it.",2018-11-18,"Opposition unity,Congress,Karnataka by-polls,General Elections 2019",Math of alliance politics – What Karnataka by-polls tell us about advantage Congress,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/general-elections-karnataka-by-polls-third-front-opposition-unity-bjp/story/1/27849.html
88,Shantanu Mukharji,"Electioneering is at full throttle across . The election-related activities assume greater significance this time due to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s display of political astuteness in engaging her political adversaries into what is being described as 'dialogue'. Such adversaries include the Jatiya Oikya Manch — a conglomerate of rightist parties — and a more significant faction led by Gano Forum chief and former foreign minister under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,  . It would be worth recalling that Hossain, a constitutional expert and Mujib-Hasina loyalist, floated a separate platform against Hasina just before the elections to take on the formidable Awami League. However, more surprising is Hossain's volte-face in consistently pressing for Begum Khaleda Zia’s release from prison and canvassing for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party's (BNP) participation in the elections as an ally. There were a slew of dialogues between Hasina and the Oikya Manch’s delegates that started from November 1. They have locked horns mainly over the release of Khaleda. Simultaneously, former President of Bangladesh AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury, a former BNP cadre, had initially allied with Hossain but parted ways as Chowdhury (of the erstwhile Bikalpa Dhara) distanced himself from the former on the grounds that Hossain was supporting the BNP that has partnered with the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI). Chowdhury realised through straws in the wind that the BNP was a 'burden' and taking it along will be an electoral suicide. However, he too held a dialogue with Hasina. General HM Ershad of the Jatiya Party (JP) followed suit. Ershad, as of now, is with Hasina but talks with the Oikya Manch did not yield any results and things are in limbo and unlikely to show any tangible results. Meanwhile, the Awami League's growing warmth towards Islamic fundamentalist Hefazat-e-Islam has raised eyebrows among a section of the liberals in Bangladesh. And such elements are not off the mark. Their argument is the same that Hefazat, perceived to be a diehard communal outfit with its hate actions in 2013 silencing liberals and abetting terror, perpetrated through hate crimes, has now tied up with the Awami League. Political analysts, however, reckon that this is political masterstroke by Hasina because of the following: activities of  . From there, the moderation that is now seen in Hefazat is a positive development. There are almost 1.4 million students studying in  . Most of the students are very poor and many are orphans. By recognising the madrasa’s degree, the government has taken a very positive step in bringing these students into the formal employment circuit in the country. By coming close to Hefazat and conceding to its list of demands, The Awami League has tactically neutralised the Hefazat's communal aggression. The recognition of degrees is expected to enable the madrasa students to compete with students from the mainstream education stream for jobs both in public and private sectors. Also, keeping these huge number of poor students outside the formal job market would mitigate a great danger of these young people becoming radicalised. The banned extremist organisations would exploit the situation to the maximum possible extent. Further, mainstreaming the madrasa students would expose them to the wider society and to the enlightened world weaning them away from the medieval and antiquated thoughts. All this is fine, but Hasina should be hawkish in keeping an eye on Hefazat activities in the longer run. Fanatics, in the past, have always let down democratic governments. Be it the Taliban in Afghanistan or the latest misdeeds of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP). The TLP initally gave signals that it was all for Imran Khan. But in the infamous Asia bibi acquittal case, it held the government to ransom. Hence, in the context of Bangladesh too, caution is called for. openly engaged in bonhomie incurring the wrath of the minority and liberals who are opposed to or are victims of Hefazat-e-Islam. Hasina, on the other hand, appears confident to handle Hefazat keeping it on a tight leash. Meanwhile, last week  downtown areas saw violence allegedly sparked off by BNP leading to many injuries and a law and order situation cropping up. Under no circumstances, the BNP or its allies like Jamaat should be given any leeway to take to the streets and agitate. That’s exactly what they want. A little political space to exploit the situation to their advantage. After all, they have nothing to lose and violence will enable the BNP to stay politically afloat. By implication, they must be enjoying moral and logistical support from inimical quarters. That needs to be curbed. Electioneering, in the meantime, is picking up steam with colourful posters and poll speeches and film actors, sportspersons and other celebrities seeking to contest in large numbers. By and large, as of now, the Awami League and party leader Hasina are riding on the waves of optimism. This enthusiasm deserve careful restraint to ensure a decisive victory for the Awami League.

89,Mehr Tarar,"In most countries there are two major political parties that individually or in alliance with other parties form a government or work as the opposition. In Pakistan there are the two major parties and their fair-weather allies. And then there is Imran Khan. Things would have continued in their linear monotony if Khan had been content to remain a former cricketer and a philanthropist, had not stirred things up a little here, some more there, challenged the status quo, and made them all squirm a bit. Squirm, mind you, nothing more. O the folly of never taking him seriously! Push the fast-forward on the film reel, and there he is. The inconsequential character actor now in the main frame as the hero, his inimitable crinkle-eyed smile wide, striding into the bright light, and saying: I told you so. Imran Khan the dispensable actor in the film of politics of Pakistan is today the prime minister of Pakistan. And while that fact is a matter of great consternation and untold melancholy to many Pakistanis who never thought - like Bollywood and Hollywood never saw it coming how an Irfaan Khan or a Hillary Swank or a Viola Davis would be suddenly propelled into superstardom with their award-winning performances - Khan would ever be more than that. He kinda is today, and what he faces as the prime minister is not your run-of-the-mill ordinary opposition. Nope. This is a whole new game of pettiness and gratuitous attacks packaged as political opposition of Khan's government, and sold domestically, regionally and internationally as the ""real, hard-hitting, unbiased"" critique of a new government. If only. There's a deluge of misleading newspaper reports, partisan op-ed articles, blogs that mostly go unread, and TV debates that focus on who's the shrillest and loudest panelist, and less on the variables of economy, the massive international debt, acuteness of water shortage, the scimitar of religious extremism held to Pakistan's delicate neck, internal security instability, tension on the borders, the issue of the imperativeness of raising of gas and electricity tariffs, and rising prices affecting everyday lives of millions of Pakistanis. What becomes breaking news is a new statement of Khan, and how it can be broken into salacious bits to write more inane op-eds, blogs, and have more TV discussions about that ""incoherent, comedian of a leader, who lacks articulation, and has no control over his words."" Khan is no Cicero, never claimed to be, and never will be. What is lost in the mindless criticism is the essence of his message, the main point of his statement or speech, and what does become a sensational, easily sold hashtag in a tweet, a TV ticker, and a headline in domestic and international media (through Pakistani media or correspondents who are mostly Pakistani): Imran Khan doesn't know what he is talking about. Prime Minister Khan in a statement to the press said: “  and caused losses as they did not take U-turns.” Without going into intricacies of European history, and whether the allusion was to the U-turns both Napoleon and Hitler made, and/or did not make marauding and killing and destroying nations on their mission of regional and world domination, what I know is that as the result of one-sided journalism, commentary and mockery, Khan’s sincerity as the leader of a country in dire straits has been questioned again. Imran Khan as prime minister has been given a Pakistan that is full of promise and potential but is presently a huge mess in a number of ways. How Khan, one step at a time, and at the end of his five-year tenure, performs will be the test of his mettle as a leader who matters. Pakistan — still in shock and anger at the recent kidnapping, torture and gruesome murder in Afghanistan of Pakistan’s valiant and heroic police officer, Tahir Khan Dawar, and a tad pacified at Khan’s promise of a thorough investigation and immediate dispensation of justice to Dawar — needs an honest and non-partisan assessment of its issues and their short- and long-term solutions. There is   denying that there has been a multi-institutional failure on multiple levels vis-à-vis Dawar’s horrific case, but what is imperative to note: Imran Khan did   create the system in which a police officer is kidnapped and taken across the border and murdered. What Khan can do and must do is review of the system, and ensure and establish a security mechanism that leaves little room for human failure to prevent loss of life in a manner that is stuff of nightmares. Doing that would   be a U-turn of Khan’s confidence in Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies; it is a reiteration of his agenda that all institutions of Pakistan must work with an effectiveness that is new and with a transparency that leaves little room for fatal errors. Pained to see Pakistan perched on the precipice of an economic disaster, and watching most monetary indexes ready to go into a free fall, Khan, going against his decades-old stance of never seeking outside help for Pakistan’s domestic mess, decided to get financial aid from old friends, Saudi Arabia and China, and approach IMF for a bailout package. To ask or not to ask was the multi-billion dollar question in the mind of a leader who had to push his self-respect and principles aside, and do what was best for Pakistan at   particular juncture. Unless it becomes a permanent feature of his governing policies, it is just what it is: Khan trying to do what is best for Pakistan. Thank you, Prime Minister Khan for   U-turn. Contrary to the perception pushed through a narrative aimed at painting a picture of a right-wing leader taking the reins of an extremist Pakistan, Khan supported the Supreme Court decision to release Aasia bibi, fully aware of a violent backlash from the organisations that exist to wreak havoc in Pakistan through their distorted interpretation of religion. Thank you, Prime Minister Khan, for U-turn. Not many thought they would see the day when an elected prime minister of a Muslim Pakistan would appear on television in a special address to the nation following protests of TLP’s Khadim Hussain Rizvi and his like-minded parties, to say in no uncertain terms, to the rioters to stop, to not oppose the Supreme Court verdict of freeing the Christian Aasia bibi, to not challenge the state writ, and to not cause anarchy. Thank you, Prime Minister Khan, for  U-turn. Khan, not known to make many statements that might trigger a vicious reaction from extremist elements of Pakistan — a tiny section but very dangerous — said without mincing words, during his phone call with President Antonio Tajani, President of European Parliament: “As citizens of Pakistan, Aasia bibi and her family are entitled to all rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of Pakistan.” Thank you, Prime Minister Khan for   U-turn. U-turns are made for myriad reasons en route to your destination: you forgot to turn off the gas in your kitchen; you left your backdoor open; you remembered you left your important papers on the nightstand; you did not realise your youngest child was home alone. U-turns of a leader, an elected prime minister, even when they give him the appearance of being fickle, are detrimental when the self is bigger than the country. When the ego is bigger than the good of the country. When the narcissism is working in collusion with the inflexibility to   acknowledge the faux pas of judgment or action. U-turns are bad when your polices are not aimed at making the country the best version of itself. When the moral vacancy of state is filled with hyperbole and big promises. When your work as a leader is harmful to the nation.

90,Sharat Pradhan,"Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath continues to remain Bharatiya Janata Party’s star campaigner in at least three of the five poll-bound states. That clearly shows how desperately the party is banking on its politics of polarisation, which is perhaps the USP of the saffron-clad chief minister of India’s most populous state. It is strange that the party leadership entrusted Yogi with the responsibility even though experiences in several states over the nearly past 12 months show that the UP chief minister failed to make any considerable difference to the BJP tally. And to top it all, BJP lost even the  Lok Sabha seat, which was considered a Yogi bastion since he had won from the constituency five successive times. Be it Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttarakhand or the Northeast states where Assembly elections were held over the past one year, Yogi Adityanath was among the key star campaigners, but he could hardly mobilise any additional vote for the BJP. Even though the party managed to romp home in most of these states, the UP chief minister had no role to play in it. In fact, he failed to even pull large crowds in Gujarat, Himachal and even Uttarakhand. Yet, the party leadership decided to handpick him for the crucial elections in the three states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where BJP is faced with a stiff wave of anti-incumbency. BJP insiders suspect that Yogi was not the popular choice of the party, but the RSS and other hardcore Hindutva forces were hell-bent on using him as the polarising figure. The fact remains that barring Chhattisgarh, where chief minister Raman Singh is credited with a lot of visible development, BJP has very little work to showcase in the other two states. While there is much disillusionment with the style of working of Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia, who has failed to deliver, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s popularity is on the wane due to multiple reasons. Under the circumstances, Yogi Adityanath is expected to come in handy to take the attention of the people away from real issues into the realm of Hindutva. Failing to fulfil the party’s promise on Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, the large-scale name-changing exercise, currently being undertaken by Adityanath in Uttar Pradesh, is being seen as the first step in the direction of polarisation. No wonder, both cities —   were chosen for name change. Without caring to understand the essence of the names Allahabad and Faizabad, the UP chief minister chose to rename them as Prayagraj and Ayodhya. The fact is that neither Allahabad founder Akbar, nor Awadh nawab Saadat Ali Khan, who built Faizabad, ever attempted to alter the original names of Prayag or Ayodhya. Both Allahabad and Faizabad were new cities built in the neighbourhood of what were popular Hindu pilgrimage centres, which remained as they were. However, the impression that Yogi and his supporters are trying to build is that he is only undoing the ‘Islamisation’ of names by Muslim rulers. Not very long ago, Yogi had also  . And even before he entered the coveted office of chief minister, he went on a renaming spree of localities in his home bastion, Gorakhpur. He renamed Humayunpur as Hanumanpur and Miya Bazar as Maya Bazar. It is widely believed that his next target is Lucknow, which is likely to be rechristened as Lakshmanpuri. He was also busy working on his plans to install an imposing statue of Lord Ram at a public place in Ayodhya. “The deity for offering prayers will remain inside the Ram temple, while this large sized statue of Lord Ram would be installed for viewing,”   in Ayodhya on Choti Diwali, which he observed on the banks of the Saryu river in Ayodhya by lighting three lakh ‘diyas’. He did so for the second consecutive year largely with the intent to keep all Ram devotees in good humour. Once again he sought to add a dash of melodrama to the mega show by getting some artists to enact the arrival of Ram, Sita and Lakhsman from their 14-year-long exile on a helicopter, symbolic of the mythical ‘pushpak viman’ that flew them down all the way from Lanka. It is said that the hype being created by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) in the name of the Ram temple through a rally proposed to be held in Ayodhya on November 25, also has the blessings of Yogi Adityanath. Evidently, Yogi hopes to turn the fate of his party in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh through the narration of the events which he considers as his prime ‘achievements’. Will these moves find resonance among the masses in the poll-bound states, or all his desperate efforts to establish himself as a star campaigner go in vain like the past, remains a million dollar question.",2018-11-14,"Ram mandir,Ayodhya,Assembly elections 2018,Yogi Aditayanth",Will Yogi Adityanath be able to make a difference for BJP in poll-bound states?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/yogi-adityanath-assembly-elections-2018-ayodhya-vasundhara-raje-scindia-ram-mandir/story/1/27792.html
91,Dev Ankur Wadhawan,"BJP’s  for Rajasthan polls is out.  Even as the party has not given a ticket to any Muslim in the first two lists, interestingly, it has dropped two of its firebrand leaders. Gyandev Ahuja and Banwari Lal Singhal are the sitting party MLAs from Alwar, whose names do not figure in the first two lists. Both have been known for making vitriolic comments. In political circles, it is being interpreted as the BJP’s attempt to distance itself from hardcore religion-based politics.  Gyandev Ahuja is the sitting MLA from Ramgarh in Alwar. This time, the BJP has fielded Sukhwant Singh from that seat, whereas from Alwar Urban, Banwari Lal Singhal’s seat, the party has given the ticket to Sanjay Sharma.   Ahuja has recently been at loggerheads with the state BJP leadership. He had demanded the removal of Vasundhara Raje as chief minister after the party’s losses in the by-polls held earlier this year. In an  gone viral, he could purportedly be heard claiming that if the current leadership was not removed, the party was doomed, and that he had informed the party leader, Ramlal, that results would be disastrous if the current leadership was not changed.  The BJP had   during the by-elections held in Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha constituencies and Mandalgarh Assembly constituency.  This, however, was   Ahuja courted controversies. His statements on JNU, about “thousands of condoms being found on the campus daily”, were widely reported. He has supported cow vigilantes on various previous occasions in Alwar. After being dropped from the list of candidates, he told   “I will not comment on the matter right now. Yes, I have not been given a ticket.” Banwari Lal Singhal, the BJP MLA from Alwar Urban, is also known for his firebrand politics, and has targeted Muslims in the past. Singhal had earlier claimed that Muslims were “increasing their population to rule the country by 2030”.  “A Hindu couple gives birth to one or two children, whereas Muslim couple is giving birth to 8 to 10, 12, 14 children. Sometimes, Muslim couples buy women in order to give birth to children. Due to this, Muslim population has been increasing at a sharp pace because of which, Hindus’ existence will come under danger. Due to rise in Muslim population, Chief Ministers in more and more states, country's Prime Minister and President will be Muslims. After that, such laws will be made by them that Hindus' existence will come under danger. Muslims will put Hindus in jail and will make use of Hindus' resources themselves... Their only motive is to increase the population to have the country proclaimed as Muslim nation and their only motive seems to be to get control of reins to power in this nation,” Singhal  said. Singhal has been less stoic than Ahuja at being denied a ticket. “I want to say that I am definitely a Hindu, have been born in Hindu community, am a Hindu, will remain a Hindu, there is no doubt in it. If my ticket has been cancelled due to Hindutva agenda, then not just one, I will let go of 100 tickets. I want to say that not just a ticket, I am ready to give up my life for Hindutva in this country.

92,Aroon Purie,"When we last did a cover story on diabetes in 2003, India had 33 million diabetics, more than the population of Canada. Fifteen years later, this figure has climbed to 82 million, equal to Germany, the world's 17th most populated country. India houses the world's second largest population of diabetics after China. From a lifestyle disease, diabetes has turned into a violent virulent epidemic, figuring in the prime minister's speeches and the government's health action plans. Our cover story 'Death by Sugar' examines the havoc wrought by this disease in recent years and detects some alarming new trends. One of them is that diabetes can be aggravated by air pollution. A new study on 1.7 million individuals published in   this July shows how inflammation from lethal air particles puts severe pressure on the pancreas, leading to diabetes. New research shows that ultra-fine pollutants classed by PM2.5 can breach the protective barrier of blood vessels, triggering inflammation and greater risk of heart events, lung disease and cancer. Pollutants interfere with the body's ability to process sugar. This is a double whammy because India is now home to 14 of the world's 20 most polluted cities. Diabetes is also being aggravated by another silent killer — obesity. About 20 per cent of Indian adults are overweight, up from just 9 per cent in 1990. About 38 in every 100 overweight Indian adults have diabetes, compared to just 19 globally. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells are to insulin. China might have overtaken India as the world's diabetes capital in 2014, but this is no consolation. The prevalence rate of diabetes in Indian adults above age 20 jumped 39 per cent between 1990 and 2016. There has been an 80 per cent rise in years of healthy life lost to premature death or disability due to diabetes during this period, the highest among non-communicable, chronic, lifestyle diseases in India, along with a 131 per cent rise in death rate. A new study between 1990 and 2016 has detected a potentially explosive increase of diabetes — in every Indian state. Excess blood sugar leading to ischaemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke, tuberculosis, cancers, Alzheimer's, dementia and cataracts among Indian diabetics account for a whopping 2,111 years of healthy life lost to premature death or disability per 100,000 population. We are staring at a public health crisis of unimaginable proportions. What was earlier seen as a rich man's disease has now engulfed social barriers. It's not hard to see why. Post-liberalisation India has seen rapid urbanisation, greater disposable incomes, increasingly sedentary lifestyles and easy access to cheap junk foods laced with sugar. Tonnes of it. India is the world's sugar capital. Last year, Indians consumed 26.5 million tonnes of the white stuff, more than twice what the US consumed. The implications of a large diabetic population are grim — it means increased healthcare spending and a less productive population. Research has established a 36 per cent jump in years lost to diabetes due to excess weight in India. Statistically, Indians are at a higher risk from diabetes — in 2016, the incidence in India is about twice the global average. Executive Editor Damayanti Datta, who has tracked the steady march of this disease in our pages over the past decade and spoke to a cross-section of experts, says she finds the link between the deadly PM 2.5 air pollutants and diabetes especially frightening. ""India is second in the world in obesity and diabetes and tops the charts in pollution. Can that be just a coincidence?"" she asks. ""Is that why everybody's getting it — young, old, men, women, rich, poor and neonates?"" These are questions we must ponder over. While a cure for diabetes still eludes researchers, the disease can be mitigated through a healthy lifestyle, eating the right food, and plenty of exercise. More importantly, it calls for intervention from the state to detect its onset. A diabetes mukt Bharat? That's a public health goal worth pursuing.",2018-11-15,"Pollution,Lifestyle disease,Health,Diabetes",Can medicine or government policies find a cure to the diabetes epidemic?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/government-policies-cure-to-diabetes-health-lifestyle-disease-pollution-pm-2-5/story/1/27814.html
93,Sandip Ghose,"Speaking at an election rally in Chhattisgarh, Congress president  '. He then went on to allege that no action has been taken because the Chief Minister of the state is corrupt, the Prime Minister himself is corrupt. Over the last year or so Rahul Gandhi has been progressively upping the ante against the Prime Minister on corruption. From accusing him of crony capitalism and being a friend of corrupt industrialists, he has moved onto calling  without mincing  words. By all accounts and appearances, the Congress is carrying out a systematic and well-planned campaign. Apart from its own analytics cell, it is believed to have deployed field researchers to gauge the impact and reactions of voters. So, these are not cavalier statements that Rahul Gandhi is making on the election trail. These are well-scripted speeches and considered positions. The strategy must be backed by data that shows the accusations are sticking after the Pandora’s Box  was opened. This should be a matter of concern for the BJP because so far, a Teflon-coated clean image has been Narendra Modi’s USP (unique selling proposition). It is clear that the Congress is trying to do a  . In fact, the Congress’ newspaper the   carried a banner headline calling “Rafale: Modi’s Bofors”. How Modi and the BJP will respond to this is yet to be seen. But, react they surely will because they cannot allow the Prime Minister’s reputation of being incorruptible get sullied. One saving grace for the BJP being, as some commentators have pointed out,  , who had a lily-white public persona. Sadly, today’s Congress and its leadership do not command the same credibility. However, the interesting take out from this crossfire is how easily labels of corruption can be put on politicians and no one bats an eyelid. The sad truth is people find it difficult to believe that anyone can be a politician and yet not be corrupt. This is not cynicism. It is based on the understanding of ground reality. Even the common man realises . Voters have a problem when the enrichment appears disproportionate and seen to benefit a handful. That was the perception on Bofors and, more recently,  etc. Now the same formula is being used for  . This is doubly unfortunate. First, because corruption in public life in indeed a fact. Second, for all our pride in being the largest democracy in the world, we look like yet another third world country, where parties come and go out of power by levelling charges of corruption against one another. The more it changes, the more it remains the same or gets worse. The point is not about the substance and veracity of the accusations. The downside of fighting elections on the plank of corruption charges devoid of ideology and real agenda is that it can descend to a zero-sum game. The public develops fatigue hearing new remixes of old records. After a while they become immune to this allegations and accept it as the new normal. That emboldens politicians further. The scale of corruption balloons. As stakes increase, so does the need for larger war chests. It becomes a vicious cycle. From there on the country easily slip on a banana peel to go the way of our South Asian neighbours. To be one up — a new wave of vendetta politics gets triggered.  in troubled waters. At the moment the opposition’s single point agenda is to defeat Narendra Modi and drive BJP out of power. For that they are willing to bury principles, ideology and past rivalries. Leading the charge as a self-anointed messiah, Rahul Gandhi is campaigning in an “as-if-there-is-no-tomorrow” mode. He has mounted a two-pronged attack. The first is targeted at Narendra Modi personally, trying to destroy his credentials for honesty. The second is aimed at  as an institution — painting it in the lurid light of communalism and anti-national antecedents. Under Rahul Gandhi, the Congress may have diluted the previous line of “ ”. But, in adopting a “ ” approach, temple runs and promise of gaushalas, he is trying to add a new layer of “Good Hindu Vs Bad Hindu” to the narrative.  This may be working as per his election strategists in pushing the BJP to the wall. The current mood of the commentariat is upbeat about the prospects of Congress and the mahagathbandhan pulling it off. There is a great deal of optimism in the anti-Modi camps about the likely outcome of the state elections. They could well be right. But, victory will not be an unmixed blessing. It will come with conditions attached. Parallels are cited about how the entire opposition got together to oust Indira Gandhi. But, there is a fundamental difference. 1977 was about defeating an individual and the threat to democracy posed by the Emergency. Now, no matter how Modi is demonised and the RSS portrayed as a fascist force — it will be seen as a battle against Hindu majoritarianism. This sentiment will get further solidified if the BJP is cornered by a disparate but united Opposition.   Narendra Modi if put on the backfoot on Rafale and other charges might choose to move away from making it a personal 1:1 fight between him and Rahul Gandhi or even the BJP Vs the dynastic Congress. In case of a setback in the Assembly elections, a broader front will open up. It would almost certainly turn into a war between the Modi and RSS Vs Rahul and the rest. Irrespective of who wins the finals of 2019, it will create chasms that might be difficult to bridge. That is a scary prospect. Looking at a cracked mirror will not be a pretty sight. Therefore, one can only wish real issues will prevail over rhetoric and propaganda.

Except an encounter in Bijapur, killing three Maoists and injuring five Cobra jawans, nothing else was reported. It was a significant success, given the influence of the Left-wing extremism, particularly in Dantewada, Bastar, Kanker and Rajnandgaon. About 700 companies of paramilitary forces ensured peaceful elections resulting in a higher turnout of voters at polling booths, which was a big jolt to the Maoists, who had threatened people with consequences, if they went out to vote. The campaigns to desist voters from exercising their democratic rights were on full swing — there were posters, banners everywhere. But, ballot won over bullet. In Manpur area of Rajnandgaon district, there were campaigns to boycott elections. Fear loomed large. But Manpur’s Kesari and Bablu were no more afraid of these threats. Forty-two-year-old Kesari, who came to cast her vote in a polling booth in Rajnandgaon, said to   that exercising her voting rights to choose a better future mattered more to her than the Maoists threats. “There are adequate security measures in the booths which encouraged us to come out and vote,” said Bablu.

95,Valson Thampu,"Great importance is now attached to names. It is assumed that names capture the totality of reality. So, if Shakespeare were to ask, “What’s in a name?” there would be a blast of an answer – “Everything”. So,  , and with that, the city stands washed of its historical association with the hated name of Akbar. Mughalsarai railway station is soon to be re-named after Deendayal Upadhyay. Not long ago, Gurgram was Gurgaon; Mumbai, Bombay; Bengaluru, Banglore; Chennai, Madras, and so on. The most delicately beautiful proposal among all is that of re-naming of Shimla as Shyamala. The good thing about India is that the scope for re-naming is almost endless, insofar as this paper revolution is driven entirely by the psychology of rejection in respect of the past. It has nothing to do with what is afoot in the present. It is not merely cities or railway stations that are re-named at will. Rahul Gandhi is referred to, in all anti-Congress propaganda material I receive, as Rahul Vinci. Before that, he was “Pappu”. To our Prime Minister, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul are not individuals but generic “mother-and-son”, while to Sambit Patra, a BJP spokesperson, Rahul is “clown prince”, and so on. Re-naming is a colonial phenomenon and it was expressive then of the right of the master to exercise his authority arbitrarily, heeding only his convenience. Thiruvananthapuram, for example, sat a bit too awkwardly on the Anglo-Saxon tongue. That clumsiness was eased by changing it to Trivandrum. There is nothing wrong about re-naming cities, institutions and even individuals. In fact, it is a welcome thing if it is effected with a view to either reviving fading historical memories, or to acknowledge what is of general value in personalities, historical or contemporary. Change is integral to the flow of life. But changes of this kind are not arbitrary or unrelated to the realities taking shape over a period of time. Generically, an infant gets re-named, if you like, as ""child"" in the course of its growth. A child is named and acknowledged as ""youth"", likewise. Merely sticking the label of ""youth"" on a one-year-old child, however, is puerilely comic. There must be, in other words, a rationale to name-changing. Suppose we want to change the name of Delhi into Suvidhabagh, the city of good facilities. What should precede the change in name is a standardisation and upgradation of civic facilities so that the change in the name makes sense to the people. Irwin Hospital, in Delhi, was re-named, under the Janata Government, as Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Narayan Hospital. The change in nomenclature was effected overnight, without any change in the character or content of the institution. If tomorrow, it is renamed as Veer Sarvarkar Hospital, the inner life of the institution – its facilities, its work culture, its practice of health and healing – will remain unchanged. That makes it comic. The psychological strategy behind the charade of re-naming is the recognition that the people crave for change. The thirst for change arises out of frustration with the status quo. Change breeds hope; even change in names and appearances. The feeling that nothing changes or will ever change breeds despair and restlessness. If lived-realities cannot be changed, at least their costumes can change. NDA-2, like its preceding regimes, came to power with a promise of change for the better – acche din. Change in names are its ceremonial substitute. Like demonetisation, for example. If the promised windfall gain for the common man – an overnight bonanza of Rs 15 lakhs – cannot materialise, at least he can be given the alternate gratification that those more privileged than him are being hit hard. Demonetisation too is of the same genre as name-changing. But there is a problem. If a people are, or pretend to be, so naïve and shallow that they get hypnotised by superficial and arbitrary exercises like changing the names of cities and railway stations, sanitising them of historical memories, they will become, willy-nilly, party to creating a climate of opinion in which diversions and distractions from lived-realities take the place of positive changes. They will get habituated to embracing illusions in lieu of good governance. In doing so, they’d legitimise a political culture in which promises can be made and broken at will and a dispensation’s iron-grip on power secured by conjuring up illusions. I’d welcome the re-naming of Delhi University as National Takshashila University – the latter being the world’s first international university – provided there is a will to make it the leading university in the world, as Takshashila was in its days. I would deem it a comic and frivolous exercise to rename Delhi University without bothering to change any aspect of its academic culture or competence. The tragedy with us is that we are far too sentimental to be sensible. It is so temptingly easy for a demagogue to set our emotions ablaze and to sweep us off our feet. What his calibrated words and gestures add up to does not bother us. But the divorce between words and their meanings is a dangerous thing. It undermines the sanity and integrity of public life. Every word is a symbol. Symbols are sign-posts to reality. To change the symbols, without corresponding changes in realities, is mere subterfuge. Akin to this is the emerging trend – increasingly evident since 2014 – of eclipsing realities with fine slogans and rhetorical turns of speech. GST is a good and simple tax, but petrol and diesel will not come within its goodness and simplicity. The government is with everyone and wants everyone’s development – sab ka saath; sab ka vikas – but that doesn’t mean that you will be safe from lynch-mobs if you are inconvenient. Beti bachao, beti patao does not mean that women will be safer. What matters is that slogans fill the mouth with sound and the mind with hope. We are gravitating towards becoming a state in which smart slogans are an adequate substitute for constitutional guarantees and improvements in quality of life.  ",2018-11-13,"Uttar Pradesh,Yogi Adityanath,BJP,Narendra Modi",Allahabad vs Prayagraj: Why current re-naming spree is a comic exercise,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/prayagraj-allahabad-narendra-modi-bjp-yogi-adityanath-uttar-pradesh-name-change/story/1/27779.html
96,Markandey Katju,"In his recent article ' ', Shashi Tharoor has revealed much about himself and his claim to be a 'liberal' and an 'intellectual'. This must have made him realise that his Hindu vote bank may be adversely affected if he did not change his 'liberal' stance. Also, it must have dawned on him that the judgment cannot be selective for Hindus alone, for on the same logic, demands may soon arise to give entrance to Muslim women to mosques (though in theory, there is no bar, in practice, hardly 1 or 2 per cent Indian mosques permit entry to women). But having already spoken out in favour of the judgment, it was of course difficult for him to make a complete about-turn.  So what does Shashi do?  Like a clever politician, he equivocates. He  , ""In implementing the Supreme Court verdict the politicians should have sought to reconcile the principles upheld by the Court with the believers' sense of the sanctity of their faith. There is a need for a mutual engagement between the liberals and traditionalists on what their convictions and doctrines mean in a changing world. The Court judgment might have been the occasion for such an engagement."" Now does this carry any sense?  Regarding the Sabarimala verdict, either one can agree with it or disagree with it — there is no middle ground. If one is a 'traditionalist', one will say that religion is a matter of faith, not reason, and since the Ayappans (devotees of Lord Ayappa) believe that he is a Naishthik Brahmachari (celibate), menstruating women cannot be allowed in his presence, otherwise the very nature of the temple gets destroyed.  On the other hand, if one is a 'liberal', they will stand for women's equality, and regard the Naishthik Brahmachari idea to be irrational. Obviously, there is no meeting ground here. So, how can one 'reconcile the principles upheld by the Court with the believers' sense of the sanctity of their faith' when the two are irreconcilable, and what will any 'mutual engagement between the liberals and the traditionalists' achieve except acrimony, abuse — possibly even violence? The basis of religion is the feeling of helplessness before natural and social forces (originally all religions were nature worship, e.g. the worship of Vedic gods like Indra, Agni, Surya, etc.). The lives of poor people are so miserable that they would go mad if they did not have religion as a psychological support.  Even for the middle and richer classes, the chance factor is so powerful in life that they plan one thing but often something else happens. Hence, they believe some supernatural entity controls their lives, which has to be propitiated. For instance, there can be business losses due to poor management, recession, change of government policy, etc.  Therefore, most businessmen are highly religious, going to temples to please the gods who may save them from losses. The truth is, it is not because of some supernatural entity but because of the low development of science as yet in the world that we are unable to control our lives. So religion (and with it, irrational beliefs and practices) will continue to exist for several more generations, maybe for over a century from now, until science has advanced to such a high level that we are able to control our lives. Any attempt to obstruct religious beliefs and practices are usually counter-productive as it makes people more bigoted and aggressive, as was witnessed after the Sabarimala verdict. About all this, our 'intellectuals' like Shashi Tharoor apparently have little understanding - yet they strut around among the ignorant public who keep clapping their hands and bowing their heads at their 'profundity'. But the fact is, when it comes to reacting rationally to a problem like the Sabarimala judgment, our 'liberals' and 'intellectuals' are all at sea.",2018-11-12,"Supreme Court,Shashi Tharoor,Liberal,Sabarimala",Shashi Tharoor at sea: The 'liberal intellectual' falters on Sabarimala ,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/shashi-tharoor-at-sea-the-liberal-intellectual-falters-on-sabarimala/story/1/27738.html

Similar protests took place across the state, mostly outside district election offices, demanding the removal of Chief Electoral Officer, SB Shashank. The protests came in the wake of the Election Commission’s decision to transfer out the principal secretary for home and finance, Lalnunmawia Chuaungo, reportedly following a letter by the CEO saying that the former was ""interfering"" in the election process.  The Election Commission, following the protests, summoned CEO Shashank to New Delhi on November 6 for a meeting, which led to protests being called off temporarily. The Mizoram government has now proposed the names of three IAS officers, as asked by the EC, for the post of a new chief electoral officer. But at the heart of the protests lies a 'conflict' that had been ruling Mizoram's politics for far too long now — Bru refugees living in relief camps in Tripura. In the run-up to the elections, trouble started after Shashank accused Chuaungo, a native of Mizoram and Gujarat-cadre IAS officer, of objecting to facilitate voting for Bru refugees for the Assembly elections. However, there are always two sides to a story. There are over  of Tripura. The Bru refugees had fled Mizoram more than two decades ago following ethnic clashes. But that doesn't mean there are no Brus living within the state of Mizoram — an   in four districts of the state. In past elections in Mizoram, Brus living in the relief camps have cast their votes from Tripura through postal ballots and other special arrangements. Now, Mizo groups fear that the casting of votes from within Tripura can lead to misuse of money and muscle power, especially in the wake of sudden ""changes of policy"" towards the refugees by a BJP-ruled Tripura and the Centre. Bru repatriation to Mizoram has been going on since 2010 in different phases, although not always successfully mainly because of disgreement over rehabilitation packages. Following the series of unsuccessful repatriation attempts, the home ministry this year announced a final repatriation bid and said that after that the relief camps would be closed and rations stopped. On July 3, the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre signed an agreement with state governments of Mizoram and Tripura  . The agreement was termed by Home Minister Rajnath Singh as a ""major breakthrough in repatriation of displaced Brus"" by the Centre. After October 1, the repatriation process had concluded, although just over 30 families returned.  following instructions from the Ministry of Home Affairs. However, there are rumours that a week later the ration supply was restarted and ""elected officials from BJP-ruled Tripura went to the relief camps to kick-start"" the process. This led to suspicions among Mizos that something fishy was going on, especially when the polls in Mizoram were so close.  There are also whispers that the manner in which the electoral-roll revision in the refugee camps was conducted raised more suspicion about vested interests.  Brus living in Tripura, on the other hand, say they are eager to cast their votes but from the relief camps, citing security reasons as well as travelling inconvenience. They say it's not possible for everyone to travel so far into interior areas of Mizoram to cast their votes. Moreover, they fear, there is always a threat to their life and security. Organisations representing the displaced Brus say they are equal citizens of Mizoram and not   yet. Many within the region feel if the Brus living in Tripura are prevented from casting their votes by the majority Mizos it won't be any different from a ""majority curtailing the democratic rights of minorities"" in other parts of India. Mizos, on the other hand, feel no electoral process should be conducted outside the state since Mizos living in other parts of the country also come back to Mizoram to cast their votes. Questions have been raised that if Brus are not ready to come back to Mizoram, why do they want to cast their votes anyway.  To add to the complications,  , the ECI had made a commitment saying Brus will vote within Mizoram for any future state assembly as well as Lok Sabha elections. Many in Mizoram now suspect that the poll panel is not so keen to keep that commitment.    While the Congress has been ruling in Mizoram for 10 years, its main opposition is the Mizo National Front. Besides several smaller parties have merged together to join the poll fray. A lot is at stake for the Congress, which will try to save its last stronghold in the region. For the BJP, as declared, capturing the Christian-dominated state will complete  . Even though the MNF is a part of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) in the region, it has said that there  . Political observers in the region are keenly watching the contest since elections across India have now practically become a two-party battle — the BJP trying to conquer its last frontiers and the Congress trying to save its last bastions. The rest, regional and lesser-known national parties, incidentally seem to have been reduced to incidental participants.  ",2018-11-12,"Bru refugees,Bjp-congress-mnf,Election Commission,Mizoram assembly elections",What's happening in Mizoram ahead of Assembly elections and why we need to know it,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/what-s-happening-in-mizoram-ahead-of-assembly-elections-and-why-we-need-to-know-it/story/1/27745.html
98,Mehr Tarar,"Blaming political leaders for everything that goes wrong around us is as common a practice as driving without giving a damn where the lane ends and who’s been overtaken from the wrong side. Blaming prime ministers for the ills that affect our daily lives is as acceptable a fact as the knowledge that eating too many carbs alters size six to ten faster than you can say damn, I’m fat. Today, blaming Imran Khan for everything that is wrong in Pakistan is as much a reality as the smog that has been ignored as fog in many parts of Pakistan for many years. And the “impartiality” of those who are doing it, despite spouting the nobility of their intention to be that of the good of Pakistan, is as subtle as a double decker bus on a one-lane road. Admit it, folks. Prime Minister Imran Khan, the words that may be of great joy and satisfaction to millions of Pakistanis who voted for him, his party workers who waited as a picture of patience for more than two decades, and tweeters who support, enunciate, tweet and troll — all kinds exist — in his favour, are nothing but a source of great agony for an equal number of people. Okay, more. Khan was always supposed to be a political outsider, the man who threatened accountability, said outrageous things, made U-turns, staged months-long dharnas, protested more than a Shakespearean prince in the company of his adoring friends, wished to establish a social welfare state based on Islamic values, and held rallies so huge they would gladden the heart of any Justin Bieber fan. Khan was never supposed to be the prime minister, as that one position had to go to one of those who thought they had patented the right to be in power. Yes, the PML-N Sharifs and the PPP Bhutto-Zardaris. Khan won the elections and became the prime minister, and while the lamentation and the protestation and the outrage and the condemnation were guaranteed to hang over his five-year tenure as scarily as the Bent-Neck Lady of  , no one could have imagined it would make its entry so noisily, so crazily and so soon. Man, and I thought I knew how political opposition in Pakistan worked. All rules of journalistic reporting, op-ed writing, tweeting and presentation of facts and analyses on TV have been whacked on the head, creating a   world of who will win the game of breaking news, propagation of false news, creation of hype, and repudiation of truth. The result is almost comical, if only life, and in this case, the political reality of Pakistan was a 1950s cartoon show. There is  ’s Fact Tracker to record Donald Trump’s “false and misleading claims” after two years of his presidential term. After a year of its implementation, analyses of the demonetisation debacle of the four-year-old Narendra Modi government are being done with more determination than that of an alpine ibex trekking up a mountain during rain. And then there is the non-stop, yes, non-stop commentary on the performance of the Imran Khan government. For the uninformed, Khan was sworn in as the prime minister of Pakistan on August 18, 2018, and not even three months have passed since his government came into existence. And unlike those in Pakistan who have been chief minister and prime minister more times than one can count on two hands, this is the first time Khan has been in any position of governmental authority. The criticism commenced before the tea-and-biscuit ceremony following his swearing-in ended. I mean, seriously, people? One of the most hilarious things was a critical op-ed in an acclaimed newspaper on the fifth day of Khan’s government. Getting used to sleep on a new memory foam mattress takes longer, here, the new prime minister was being judged on the fifth day. There’re some people who’re in a race with themselves: on how to beat their own record of inanity, partisan agenda-pushing and negative narrative formation. They excel at what they do, and pat their own back, religiously, three times a day. Healthy criticism, a critical eye on the working of a new government, hard questions, expectation of satisfactory answers, and a regular assessment of government policies and initiatives is the prerogative of media, and even citizens of a country. That is how healthy democracies function and flourish. What is happening in Pakistan is anything but that. Attacking Imran Khan and his government is not done in the good of Pakistan; it is being carried out as a part of a systematic demolition of the credibility of the new government. It is a black comedy of the puppet masters and the drama they mis-wrote. Political parties that have been defeated in the elections have made it all a personal game of vendetta, a la Queen Cersei Lannister of the  : if you wrong me I will burn all of you to ashes in the Great Sept of Baelor. Pakistan’s wellbeing be damned, let’s make Imran Khan rue the day he took the prime ministerial oath, fumbling on a word or two. The economic mess created by previous rulers forces Khan, contrary to his staunch conviction about never seeking help, to ask friendly countries to help. Oh yes, the mess is theirs, but it is Khan who is doing the “ "". An anti-ostentation and pro-austerity Khan is reluctant to live in the palatial Prime Minister House, but that idea is ridiculed. Without a pause, it all became a full-time tamasha. Khan’s wife is in a  , but that has been made an issue in a Muslim country. Khan wishes to make Pakistan green but the commentary has swerved to the types of trees that are being planted.

99,Sudarshan Ramabadran,"As the South Korean First Lady Kim Jung-sook set foot in India on her first foreign visit without being accompanied by her husband, President Moon Jae-in, a historical page that defines India’s soft power narrative has been written and celebrated. What is most significant is that the First Lady commemorated the rich legacy and lineage of Heo Hwang-ok of the Karak dynasty — whose original name is believed to have been   by laying the foundation stone to expand a monument dedicated to the ancient queen, in Ayodhya. On reaching the historic city, the Kim Jung-sook’s first stop was the existing plaque and park dedicated to Suriratna. She also attended grand Diwali celebrations alongside Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, including cultural shows and the spectacular lighting of more than 300,000 lamps on the banks of the Saryu river. Kim Jung-sook certainly made a strong and graceful statement by donning a sari at the festivities, but the greater statement was made by the reason for her very presence. The original memorial for Suriratna was inaugurated in 2001 by a Korean delegation, which included over 100 historians and government representatives. Then in 2016, a Korean delegation proposed to develop the memorial further. A memorandum of understanding was signed between the governments of both countries. The recent visit by the First Lady consolidated and solidified the cultural bond and the flourishing robust economic ties between India and South Korea. The ability to build such cultural connections is indeed the new currency in international relations. Professor Joseph Nye, who first coined the phrase ""soft power"" 27 years ago has said, ""Power with others can be more effective than power over others,"" and this is being demonstrated by India’s international relations in the present age. Other nations are keeping pace. As part of its renewed foreign policy approach, South Korea has officially documented its foreign policy initiatives towards India, as part of its  . Apart from prospective economic reasons, South Korea also wants to enable an India led Indo-Pacific region by rejuvenating its relations with India. Several visiting South Korean ministers have reiterated that historically their country has had no sensitive geo-political issues with India. In fact, while visiting India in July earlier this year, which was the longest visit by the head of either country, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, emphasised on the ancient relations between India and South Korea. He referred to queen Suriratna in  , “India and Korea have a long history of exchanges and have been friends helping each other in difficult times. Indian Princess Heo Hwang-ok (Korean name) from the Kingdom of Ayuta came to Korea about 2,000 years ago and later became the Queen of Korea’s ancient Gaya Kingdom.” 
 
 Kim Byung-Mo, an anthropologist from Hanyang University, has identified Ayuta as Ayodhya in India. Chinese language texts have referred to a dream the then King of Ayodhya had, where God ordered him to send his 16-year-old daughter to South Korea to marry King Kim Suro. It is said by historians that today there are more than six million descendants of the couple, which is roughly about 10 per cent of the entire South Korean population. The visit of President Moon had also marked the 45th anniversary of establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties. In this way, historic stories do not only illustrate, but also illuminate and inspire. Ayodhya, which is best known as the birthplace of Prince Rama and which interestingly translates as a “place of no conflict”, holds special significance for the said community of South Koreans, many of whom believe that they trace their ancestry to the city. In fact, it appears to be more than just a belief a fact, which was so firmly validated by the First Lady’s recent visit. On YouTube there are videos available which show how Korean youth start by tracing India-South Korea relations to the story of Suriratna and attribute that as a focal point in strengthening relations between the two countries. The fact that her story resonates with Korea’s gen-next even to this date, speaks volumes. The respect is mutual. Recently, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Uttarakhand Investors Summit in Dehradun, he affirmed that South Korea was a country that he had wished to emulate as erstwhile chief minister of Gujarat as the state and the country shared almost the same population.  , “I was asked who I see as my idol for development in Gujarat. Usually, when people are asked this, they say, 'I want to make the place like America or like England.' But I gave a different answer. I said that I want to make it (Gujarat) like South Korea.” Many Indians won’t know this, but more than 100 years ago, Rabindranath Tagore wrote a poem on Korea, titled “Light of the East”. Even today, Koreans learn this poem during their college years.  All this clearly indicates the close bond between the two countries. Expanding the monument for Heo Hwang-ok furthers cultural as well as economic bonds between India and South Korea, but this is about much more than just tourism. It is about honouring the beliefs of the descendants of Suriratna and focussing on that which connects in a world where the focus is more often on that which divides and disintegrates. Amidst the hue and cry about the installation of statues in today’s India, let’s look beyond face value at the strategic big thinking involved in placing India in the global scene. Our statues and memorials are symbols of our soft power as a nation. We’re no longer sheepish players on the world stage. India is stepping into the limelight and presenting her soft power in all the right ways and with all the right vantage points in this old yet new narration. As a country, important projects like   and a memorial for Suriratna in Ayodhya will posit India as a well-documented history and more importantly, it sets the scene for India’s cultural influence outside India to be adequately analysed in academic discourses.",2018-11-09,"Kim jung-sook,Suriratna,South Korea,Ayodhya",How a monument dedicated to a South Korean queen in Ayodhya is a symbol of India’s soft power,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kim-jung-sook-south-korea-suriratna-narendra-modi-ayodhya/story/1/27692.html
100,Majid Hyderi,"The recently held in Kashmir witnessed a comparatively low voter turnout, due to months of unease in the restive region. But the results clearly convey that winds of change have begun to blow over the Valley’s political landscape, at least in the mainstream. Moving forward, the Abdullahs and the Muftis won’t necessarily be the only alternative to each other in ruling the state. A strong third front has emerged in Jammu and Kashmir. Peoples Conference (PC) chairman Sajad Gani Lone and People’s Democratic Party rebel leader Maulana Imran Reza Ansari are up in action, as a deadly combination against the two dynasties that have ruled the state for decades. On November 6,  mayor of strategically-important Srinagar, as the PC’s candidate to the post. The summer capital has traditionally been dominated by the National Conference and the PDP, led by Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti respectively. The NC and the PDP  the urban local body polls, demanding that the Centre make clear its stand on Article 35A, which grants special status to J&K. But then, it was an open secret that both parties had fielded their proxies — a belief strengthened by both outfits maintaining silence over such allegations. In the city spanning 74 municipal wards, Mattu, a former NC leader who preferred “ghar wapsi” into the PC, bagged the support of 40 councilors to emerge as the mayor. His arch rival and Congress candidate got only 26. An independent contestant in the poll fray, Mattu was backed by the PC and covertly supported by Imran Reza Ansari and others in his rebel group. These leaders had raised a banner of revolt against Mehbooba Mufti   earlier this year. The BJP, which won four wards in the SMC elections, had also thrown its weight behind Mattu. In the SMC elections, Independents bagged 53 out of 74 wards, while the Congress secured 16 wards. Lone, a former minister whose party was not given an election symbol, had fielded his candidates as Independents. And, 20 of them won. Mattu’s success in the mayor elections suggests that the other 20 who backed him were proxies of Ansari, who is also a prominent Islamic leader enjoying influence in Shia pockets across Kashmir. Though the PC made a clean sweep in Lone’s native Handwara constituency in frontier Kupwara, bagging all 13 seats, it’s their maiden victory in Srinagar that makes a big difference. Srinagar, with eight Assembly seats, traditionally holds the key to the state’s throne. Over the years, it has been believed that the party which bags a majority in Srinagar emerges as the ruling party in the state. After his local body polls victory, Lone sounds confident, aggressive. Addressing a press conference to celebrate the win, the PC Chairman said his party had “emerged as an alternative to the dynastic parties”. “The so-called boycotters united to defeat my candidate Junaid Mattu. I am delighted over my party’s victory, because NC, PDP and Congress had allied against us. I wonder where the councilors of these parties sprang up from, when they had taken the high moral ground of boycotting the polls,” he said. Lone endorses his alliance with Ansari. The duo is in news for their friendship, and many of their admirers define them as the ‘deadly-duo’.  In fact, taking inspiration from yesteryear blockbuster  , the two are reportedly also called Jai and Veeru, aspiring to uproot the “Gabbars.” But then, if Lone-Ansari is emerging as an alternative to the ruling dynasts, the Abdullahs and the Muftis, it means people are fed up of years of governance marred by allegations of corruption and favouritism. After all, Governor SP Malik  that the “twin evils of corruption and nepotism have been at their peak in Jammu and Kashmir.” Solving a problem as complex as Kashmir, with tentacles spread as far as Muzaffarabad and even beyond, hasn’t been possible for regional politicians so far. And it might never be. But the deliverance of good governance void of corruption and favouritism is something achievable. If Lone-Ansari have emerged as a new hope, the “deadly-combination” needs to understand how to live up to the public’s aspirations and expectations. Otherwise, Kashmir has been a graveyard of reputations — where the once lively Abdullahs and the Muftis are just adding to the narrative of political deaths, this time at the hands of Lone and Ansari.",2018-11-08,"PDP,Jammu and Kashmir,Sajad Gani Lone,Junaid mattu","Meet the men shaking up the 'empire' of Abdullahs, Muftis in Jammu and Kashmir",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/srinagar-mayor-junaid-mattu-urban-local-body-polls-in-kashmir-national-conference-pdp/story/1/27689.html
101,Sharat Pradhan,"It was no surprise when a day before Diwali, on November 6, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath  . We could see this coming as barely three weeks ago, he had renamed  . After all, changing names of cities and localities has always been high on the list of priorities of the saffron-clad chief minister, whose entire politics has apparently hinged on symbolism and religious polarisation. Even before he rode on to the coveted position of chief minister, Yogi Adityanath was better known for bulldozing his way to rename localities in his home and political bastion, Gorakhpur. Miyan Bazar was renamed ‘Maya Bazar’ and Humayunpur was rechristened as Hanumanpur during the days he was a member of Parliament from the city, named after the famous 11th century seer, Gorakhnath, whose temple trust Yogi Adityanath continues to head. What good the change of name has done or would do to these localities or the cities is a million dollar question. But history shows that no matter how much some mediaeval rulers might have been condemned for their alleged religious intolerance, perhaps they were more tolerant that their 21st century counterparts. Researchers have confirmed that both Prayag and Ayodhya have existed since the ancient times and no ruler ever attempted to rename them. Sixteenth century Mughal emperor Akbar, who built the city of ‘Illahabas’ (abode of the divine) that got converted to the anglicised Allahabad during the British regime, never even attempted to rename Prayag that was always recognised as the town around the holy ‘Sangam’ (confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers).  Likewise, Awadh’s first nawab Saadat Ali Khan, who built Faizabad on the banks of the Ghaghra river in 1730, made no attempt to give any new name to Ayodhya that was always known as the birthplace of Lord Ram. The ancient temple town eventually became a part of Faizabad district, carved out by the British. Ayodhya thrived as a popular Hindu pilgrimage destination and all its economic activity centred around religious tourism. Historical records have confirmed that the funding for the maintenance and upkeep of Ayodhya’s oldest temple — Hanuman Garhi — came from the Nawab’s treasury. This healthy practice continued even after Saadat ali Khan’s grandson Asaf Ud-daula shifted the capital of Awadh from Faizabad to Lucknow, soon after he inherited the throne in 1775. And significantly, just as ‘Illahabas’ meant ‘abode of the divine’, Faizabad meant a ‘place for the good of all’ Both these cases clearly reflect the high tolerance levels of the two rulers, whose secular credentials also stand certified on the same account. Sure enough, if they had no concern for the sentiment of the local Hindu population, they could have easily imposed their arbitrary will on their subjects and changed the names of the two ancient towns. Instead, they chose to build new cities in the neighbourhood of the old towns. On the contrary, the present UP chief minister apparently chose to rename Allahabad and Faizabad, without taking into account anybody’s sentiment. Some even suspect that the decision was taken only to spite a certain section of the society, which arouses doubts about the sincerity behind his much-touted “sabka sath-sabka vikas” slogan. If it were to be believed that the move would give a socio-economic boost to these two places, then what stopped the government from carving out both Prayag and Ayodhya as independent districts by chopping away some bit from their respective bordering districts? In fact, that was how new districts were usually created. Such action could have kept the glory of both the ancient historic names of Ayodhya and Prayag, without erasing the names of Allahabad and Faizabad. In the bargain, the government could have also saved a huge amount of taxpayers' money that will go into effecting the consequent changes in the government records — institutions and stationary etc. Ironically, the BJP leadership was very critical of then Samajwadi Party chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, when he took a unilateral decision to change the names of the new districts created by his predecessor Mayawati in the names of different dalit icons. Evidently, the change from Faizabad to Ayodhya has not amused those who were anxiously awaiting some concrete action on the Ram temple promise, when sometime back Yogi Adityanath declared that he was going to bring some “good news” to Ayodhya on this Diwali. Even the added announcement of getting a huge statue of Lord Ram installed at the Ram Katha park in Ayodhya is no compensation for those who have looked up to the BJP as the party that will build their much-awaited Ram temple at the disputed Ramjanmbhoomi-Babri Masjid site . However, the only purpose that the rechristening could serve is to polarise the electorate. And who cares if that is achieved through a display of intolerance!",2018-11-08,"Prayagraj,Yogi Adityanath,Name change,Ayodhya",Faizabad becomes Ayodhya: Why we are not surprised at all this time,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/faizabad-becomes-ayodhya-why-yogi-adityanath-could-not-surprise-us-this-time/story/1/27668.html
102,Beebagr Baloch,"India was divided in 1947 – and Pakistan was formally carved out on August 14, 1947, all in the name of religious hatred. After Pakistan emerged on the map of the world, it started promoting religious terrorism in the region and globally as well. At some point or the other, the entire world’s top most wanted terrorists have had connections, or have been stationed, in Pakistan. Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar, Mullah Mansoor, Hafiz Saeed, released Taliban leader Mullah Baradar and other terrorists found sanctuary in Pakistan under the protection of its army. The country is the second home to many of the world's religious terrorists because Pakistani military and intelligence – as well as the majority of Punjabis there – believe that the country has come into existence in the name of religion, so the protection of religious jihadist extremists is their duty and in their national interest. Over the years, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan has fully supported ""Kashmiri militants"" and leaders who demand independence from India. From 1989 to 1999, the Pakistani state fully supported rebelling Kashmiris. During this period, thousands of Indian security personnel were killed by militants, and many more Kashmiri and Indian civilians also targeted by Pakistan-backed militants. Their actions established a reign of fear - and drove out   from the valley.  The interesting thing is that in 1996, Baloch patriotic leader Hyrbyair Marri laid the foundation of the current Baloch freedom movement. For the first time in Baloch history, this saw the Baloch movement spread from Kohistan Marri area to Gwadar, Balochistan. People from across the region and from all walks of life contributed to the Baloch movement. A state minister from Balochistan, Hyrbyair Marri belongs to Kohistan Marri which has huge reserves of gas, oil and others mineral resources, all which he could have used for his own gain. Yet, he left his luxurious life and started the current Baloch movement. A man who is trustworthy, extremely honest and loyal to the Balochi cause. Heroic and uncompromising, Marri enjoys the support of the entire Baloch nation. Even to the Pakistanis, it has always been clear that getting their hands on Khair Bakhsh Marri and Hyrbyair Marri is almost impossible. One of Pakistan's top politicians, Hasil Khan Bezanjo, informed the Pakistani parliament and military that they cannot bring Hyrbyair Marri to the negotiations table. The Pakistanis know that the movement Hyrbyair Marri started has totally disturbed Pakistan because it was this movement that encouraged towering Baloch leaders, like Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, to also join in. A man who lived like a king in Dera Bugti, Akbar Khan left all things for the Baloch cause – and eventually embraced martyrdom for the dream of a free Balochistan. His murder by Pakistan was a turning point. It showed the youth that if Nawab Bugti, at the age of 80, can sacrifice his life for the Baloch cause, then they can too.  Hyrbyair Marri's brother, Balach Marri, who was a member of the Balochistan assembly, is another such figure who left a comfortable life to join the Baloch freedom movement. He also embraced martyrdom to further the cause of the Balochistan liberation struggle. BNM leader Ghulam Muhammad was an ordinary man who embarked on an extraordinary journey of galvanising and organising Baloch people in support of Balochistan’s independence. Pakistani forces, it is said, abducted him along with his friends Lala Munir and Sher Mohammad Baloch from their lawyers’ office; their tortured dead bodies were found after seven days. The Balochistan freedom struggle has also indirectly impacted the Kashmir issue. In 2004 when Pakistan's military leadership was engaged in fighting against Nawab Akbar Khan and Balach Marri, top advisors on Kashmir apparently requested General Parvez Musharraf to divert Pakistan’s attention from Kashmir to Baluchistan and solve the Baloch issue first, or risk it festering and affecting the Kashmir movement. According to some Pakistani military analysts, they worked out many fronts to counter the Baloch movement. ISI, through its puppets and undercover agents, attempted to divide the Baloch people on the basis of caste, class and tribe.  Yet, those who were involved in the movement did not fall into the trap of these infiltrators – and Pakistan's false propaganda – but some Indians were confused and misled by the anti-Baloch freedom struggle campaign of the ISI and its hirelings. Hence, there are some Indians who wrongfully believe that the Baloch are divided. But, even if they are, the important question is, who is attempting to divide the Balochis? The main political stakeholders of the current Baloch struggle are Hyrbyair Marri, Brahumdagh Bugti and his Baloch Republican Party and Khalil Baloch. The weakening of any of these three major faces – and their parties – would be tantamount to the weakening of the Baloch struggle. Yes, there might be some differences on different issues, but the fact remains that all of us are united on the question of Balochistan’s independence. The irony is when there are differences of opinion in Europe – and other countries – the contradictions are called the ""beauty of democracy"". Yet, when that ''beauty of democracy'' comes to Balochistan, it gets called ''lack of unity''? Even in the Pakistani side of Kashmir, there exist many parties with differing opinions, but the Pakistani state has never made the same excuse there. Even as the Pakistani government goes on to support the Kashmiri cause at the UN and other international forums, it used the same reasons to attack the Baloch movement. Pakistan's former military generals and others have debated that if Pakistan succeeds in weakening the Baloch movement, not only will they be able to take control of Afghanistan through their proxies, but also be able to tackle the Kashmir issue more effectively. That’s why they are apparently making a scheme of bringing millions of Chinese and Punjabis to Gwadar, to totally destroy the Baloch and gain superiority over the area with the help of China. If Pakistan and China succeed in their plans of suppressing the Baloch liberation movement, it would not only be disastrous for Balochistan but will also have devastating effects on the US, Afghanistan and India. Through their proxy Taliban and other religious extremists, they will take control of Afghanistan, counter India through Kashmiri militants and weaken the US influence in the region with the Chinese influx in Gwadar. China already plans to build a naval base inside a gated city and eventually take control of the Strait of Hormuz. Once China gets a stronghold in Gwadar, it will easily control the Chabahar port as well.

Diwali, the festival of light and happiness, is one such occasion that makes dissimilitude – diversity – felt. In India, it is intrinsically placed across communities – and makes its impact even beyond the cultural sphere. Diwali reaches everything where money matters. So, the culture criss-crosses with materialism, money and the cycle of prosperity – this shapes the factors of celebration. In Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, the festival of light is celebrated in symbolic form by Hindus and Sikhs who happen to be living the existence of ""minorities"" there. Bhutan is relatively liberal and the Hindus living there celebrate Diwali to the fullest. In Nepal, Diwali is celebrated by the name of ""Tihar"". The time between Dashain (Durga Puja) and Tihar is considered the most auspicious in the country; till a few years ago, when the monarchy was still surviving, there used to be long holidays to celebrate the festivals. In Nepal, the celebrations of Diwali or Tihar are most intricate and driven through historical tales and myths. Tihar is a five-day-long eventful affair, with each day dedicated to Kaag Tihar (Crow Puja), Kukur Tihar (Dog Puja), Gai Tihar or Laxmi Puja (Cow or Goddess of Wealth Puja), Goru Tihar, Govardhan Puja, Maha Puja or Aatma Puja (Ox Puja) and Bhai Tika, Bhai Dooj (festival for brothers and sisters). This particular way of celebration is linked to Tihar’s mythological relation with Yama, the god of death, and his sister Yamuna. As per accounts of oral history, Yama had been staying away from his sister for a long time; Yamuna wanted to meet him, so she asked various sources to tell him to give her a visit. For that, she relied on a crow, dog and cow, and at the end, went herself to see her brother. Upon meeting Yama, Yamuna worshipped him with Tika (five-coloured mark) and flowers. Yamuna made a circle with mustard oil, Dubo grass and put Makhmali mala, asking Yamaraj not to go till the oil, Dubo grass and the flowers got dry. Therefore, to date, every sister worships her brother keeping him in the circle of mustard oil, putting a mala (garland) of Makhmali flowers and Dubo grass. In Terai, this is celebrated as ""Diwali"" and the Newari community calls it Swanti"", celebrating it uniquely. Since Tihar lasts for five days (Kartik Krishna Trayodashi to Kartik Shukla Dwitiya), it is also known as ""Yama Panchak"" (literally, five days of Yama Raj). On these days, believers do everything possible to keep Yama Raj happy, in the belief that ""treating the soul"" post the mortal existence is his prerogative.  Unlike India, where Diwali is celebrated with light and attributes related to the household and the material world, in Nepal, animals and birds, such as crows, dogs, cows and oxen are also worshiped for their symbiotic terms with humans. For the main Tihar day, this folk song aptly captures the essence of attachment the Nepalese have to this festival: “भैलिनी आइन आगना गुन्यो चोलो मागन, हे औसी को दिन गै-तिहारओ भैलो ।बडाली कुडाली राखेको, लक्ष्मी पूजा गरेको, हे अजको दिन गैतिहारओ भैलो ।” (Today is no moon day and Cow Puja and Bhailo day, the house is clean and you have done Laxmi Puja, today is cow Puja day and Bhailo) On the Bhai Tika day, the Rani Pokhari Temple in Kathmandu is opened for those who do not have a brother or sister. Noticeably, on this day only, the temple is open to the general public. A fable tells us that during a ritual of ""brother worship"" the messenger of Yama Raj came to collect the soul of the man going through ""brother worship"". But to stop this, the sister kept performing ""brother worship"", and requested the messenger to wait until she completed. The caring sister invited the messenger to sit along with her brother and get the honour of ""brother worship"". This pleased the messenger so much that he asked her to wish for anything as a gift. The loving sister asked the messenger for the long life of her brother – thus, saving his life. Another story about the ""brother worship"" states that Yama Raj had five days off, as Lord Vishnu entrusted Bali Raja to rule the three worlds for five days. Yama Raj’s world was one of the three worlds. With having the luxury of time, he went to meet his sister, as it was pending for a long time. Seeing her brother, Yamuna, Yama Raj’s sister, became so happy that she couldn’t manage just one way to welcome her brother whom she was seeing after a long time. She did everything possible thus to keep her brother happy and well-looked after for five days. While departing to his own world, Yama Raj reciprocated his sister’s warmth with a unique gift that set the tradition of ""brother worship."" While these ancient practices are still rejoiced over for celebrating a fast-modernising and consumption-driven festival like Diwali, it is to be noted that India’s tryst with globalisation was not limited to trade only – it has had deep impact on other countries' cultural sides as well. However, the irony is that countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh, once in the same cultural trajectory where India still is, are now bereft from an inclusive approach in treating Hindus and absolutely missing an opportunity to thrive through cultural reconciliation. Today, when we are celebrating the lights and the longing for happiness all around us, it would be worth giving consideration to the deep chasm created in South Asia's quest to end colonial rule and attain self-rule. The old mistakes are still defining our collective sphere, especially in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. For better historical reasons, Nepal and Bhutan are in a different league – and the way of celebrating the festival of light in both these countries are strikingly in sync with their independent past, normal present and a promising transition.",2018-11-06,"Bhutan,Nepal,Bangladesh,Pakistan","Diwali lights, and some dark, across South Asia",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/diwali-festival-of-lights-pakistan-bangladesh-nepal-bhutan/story/1/27661.html
104,Madhuri Danthala,"One of Mark Twain's lesser known novels, which he wrote with his close friend Charles Dudley Warner,  , in 1873 is uncannily reminiscent of the world we live in today. It was an era of rising economic inequality, stagnant living standards, growing anxieties about monopolies in the economy, crippling financial crises, political discourse being dominated by whipped-up emotions that the country (the USA) was doomed, and political corruption with 'wave' elections. In fact, the era between 1973 and the end of the century came to be known as the 'Gilded Age'. And Charles Dudley Warner's (many people mistake it to Mark Twain) quote: 'Politics makes strange bedfellows', became a popular expression to explain the most opportunistic alliances in politics. While there have been many stories of 'foes turning friends' (and vice versa), in India, the alliance between the TDP and the Congress is something that even seasoned observers of Indian politics are not able to make sense of. It's a surreal moment for those who follow the politics of Andhra Pradesh. They surely are the strangest of all possible bedfellows, given the acerbic past they shared in the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh. However, if one looks more closely, despite the bitter campaigning during each election, many leaders have frequently shifted camps depending upon who the victor was. Electoral results shaped the leaders' worldviews and their 'ideologies' suddenly dawned upon them. In reality, there was no real ideology either of the parties (much like all the other political parties in India) believed in or espoused. The alliance is a cruel signal to the party supporters that 'ideologies' are not meant for leaders to follow, but for the millions of faceless volunteers. Political arithmetic is given importance over the emotions and aspirations of the volunteers on the street. Before making such alliances, supporters of the party are seldom taken into confidence, and are expected to defend the decisions of the leaders - who may switch sides and return, depending on the electoral fortunes. In forging an alliance with the TDP, the Congress leadership has exposed its naivete as it ignores the emotions of its supporters as well as the TDP supremo's past which is chequered with constantly discarding his principles to back the winning side. While the TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu claims that this is a 'democratic compulsion', the Congress should recall the days when he was the convenor of the United Front to which the Congress extended outside support. Back then, the parties that supported the United Front kept aside their differences to keep the BJP out of power, and much like today, the stated objective was to 'protect the country from divisive forces'. Yet, in 1998, Naidu switched over to the BJP's side, claiming that the people of Andhra Pradesh wanted to see Vajpayee as the Prime Minister of India. He further claimed that he was joining the BJP-led NDA so that the TDP can be a 'restraining influence' which will keep them 'under check'. Yet, he continued to support the NDA - even after 2002's Gujarat riots. After losing power along with the BJP in 2004, he cited his continuance with the BJP as one of the prime reasons he lost. He eventually pulled out of the NDA - but went back to the BJP in 2014, despite it being led by Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister during the Gujarat riots. It is therefore very surprising that the Congress is forging an alliance with the TDP, despite the disapproval of its own leaders and supporters, carrying out a move which is being perceived as a breach of trust. India's 'Gilded Age', will probably be known as the time when ideologies of parties didn't matter and only the whims of party chiefs did. If only the leaders of political parties realised that a party's greatest asset is its supporters who truly believe in ideology-based politics. That would inspire more educated youth to take part in politics.",2018-11-06,"Rahul Gandhi,Andhra Pradesh,Chandrababu Naidu,Congress-tdp alliance",Congress-TDP alliance exposes Rahul Gandhi's naivete,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrababu-naidu-rahul-gandhi-telangana-assenbly-elections-lok-sabha-elections-2019-andhra-pradesh-assembly-elections/story/1/27648.html
105,Rohit Parihar,"In Rajasthan, it is a game of fresh versus old faces for both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Although the two parties have prepared their first lists, which have been sent to their respective high commands, Rahul Gandhi from Congress and Amit Shah from the BJP have turned these lists away. The two have demanded that the lists be backed with better research, as these have names of some candidates who are likely to lose. The Rajasthan BJP has carried out two different exercises. In one, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, along with other prominent leaders, took verbal, written, and confidential feedback on probable candidates. The other has been the probability of winning candidates and whether the ones sitting would lose the opportunity based on internal surveys. The problem here is that the BJP has 161 MLAs in the 200- member Assembly, of which one 100 are likely to lose, going by perception. One lobby insists that most of these sitting candidates be replaced by either their family member or someone else, with their consent. This is because their contribution to the party and their experience cannot be ignored. The other side says that while these candidates should be roped in, the party must give a chance to new faces to expand their base. This makes sense as Raje’s ministers have contributed strongly to the prevalent anti-incumbency due to their arrogance, utterances against her, and unavailability to the public as well as the MLAs. Many MLAs also added to this either with their misdeeds, or failure to help their constituents. Shah is believed to have told the state unit to redo this exercise with research of past voting trends and caste composition of the constituencies. He also wants to curb promoting one family. In the  , BJP had fielded Jaswant Singh Yadav, a sitting MLA and minister from Alwar, and Ramswaroop Lamba, son of the late Ajmer MP Sanwar Lal Jat. Both lost badly. Insiders say Yadav now seeks a ticket for himself or his son, but the high command is reluctant. Several other veterans or sitting MLAs, who are likely to lose, want tickets for their family members. But the BJP feels such a move cannot beat anti-incumbency, and the party should bring in real change. The high command is also clear that those who have been taken care of by the party have no reason to revolt if they are denied a ticket. It will then take more time before the candidate list is finalised. As far as the Congress is concerned, Gandhi, who reportedly agreed that a candidate should be capable to win, is upset with the little preference given to fresh faces. For long, Congress has banked upon some veterans who win one and lose another, but still keep getting a ticket. In fact, some have even lost successive polls. Now, a strong lobby within the party is rooting for discarding such leaders, including tainted ex-ministers. “Our image will get a boost if we deny ticket to ex-ministers with a bad image, or those who are bound to lose the next election even if they win this time,” says a senior Congress leader involved in the selection of candidates.

106,DailyO,"‘Leaving for district jail Shekhapura 2 see Aasia Bibi with mercy petition for Prezdnt Zardari. Hum ne   tweeted Salman Taseer, former governor of Pakistan’s Punjab Province, on November 20, 2010. Salman Taseer had gone to argue the case of a Christian woman,   who was accused by her neighbours of blasphemy. The fateful fight started over a cup of drinking water, where she was accused of polluting it. Religious insults were hurled from both sides, as is common in every society, but soon, a crowd of villagers surrounded this mother of five and accused her of insulting the Prophet. A year later, she was convicted of blasphemy under Pakistan’s Penal code and sentenced to death. It was this decision which Salman Taseer openly decided to appeal. His appeal was accepted. Two months later, Salman Taseer   by his body guard, Mumtaz Qadri. Asia was confined to Sheikhpora Jail, Lahore. A windowless room where, out of fear of being poisoned by the cook, guards or the other inmates, she cooked for herself. Mumtaz Qadri was  and executed. While alive, 300 lawyers pledged to fight his case pro bono. His funeral, attended by hundreds of thousands, was one of the largest gatherings of Pakistanis ever. The Mumtaz Qadri Shaheed Foundation was set up and received on its first day donations of 80 million rupees. Soon, a shrine was constructed at his grave, so that followers could pay obeisance to his soul. A shrine itself is considered to be  under Islamic doctrine, the highest form of sin, which Allah himself cannot forgive. Wahabism has frowned at the idea of Barelvis praying at structures which find no mention in the Quran. Yet, they remain a continued part of Barelvi Muslim practice. And Barelvis are ardently supportive of the draconian Blasphemy laws. Radicalism in Muslims is no longer confined to Wahabis and Salafis. Barelvis were the principle component of the huge numbers that attended Mumtaz Qadri’s funeral. The area around Mumtaz Qadri’s shrine is now a hotspot for land dealings — many Pakistanis are flocking to live around the ‘piousness’ of the saint. Blasphemy in Pakistan is not a law and order problem, as it is a religio-political phenomenon. After Asia Bibi was acquitted by the Supreme court, crowds gathered on Lahore and Kararchi streets,   a ‘bhagawat against Bajwa’ (revolt against the Pakistani Military), and for rebellion against the State for letting a 'Ghustakh-e-Rasool' go free. In one of the speeches that played on Facebook Live and was shared 20,000 times, the speaker is heard saying, “When you do such things, you know what happens? A Mumtaz Qadri is born. Another is born. One day in a Khutba meeting on Friday, one man will rise and tell himself that he will not allow that woman to live anymore, that he will be the hero who saves the honour of the Prophet. That day, Supreme Court’s faisla will mean nothing.” The crowd shouts Inshallah. The day she was acquitted, #HangAsiya was the number 1 trend on social media in Pakistan. This widespread indignation, which stems from an overt religiosity and uniform hatred for blasphemers, was already tapped into by the Tehreek-i- Labaik party in Pakistan. In the recent Prime Ministerial elections,  2.6 million votes and emerged as the fifth largest party in the elections. Tehreek-e-Labbaik renewed its expansion with protests-cum-campaigns on the day of the verdict itself. Khadim Hussain Rizvi urged all Muslims in the Army  against chief General Bajwa, and declared the three judges ‘Wajib-ul-Qatl’ (justified to be killed). He urged the judges’ security men, drivers, and any person who had access to them to kill them. Imran Khan was to be called a ‘Yahoodi Baccha (a son of Jews)’ and his government had to be overthrown. He announced that Justice Khosa was the same person who had sentenced the martyr “Hazrat” Mumtaz Qadri, and regretted that the ummah had not killed him earlier, one the very day of the sentencing. The crowd roared ""Labbaik!"" The Tehreek-e-Labbaik led processions in Lahore, Karachi and Faislabad,  , rickshaws, carts, pelting stones as they chanted Islamic slogans. Four people were reported dead as the country came to a halt over a poverty-stricken woman being allowed to live and go free after 8 years of solitary confinement. Khadim Hussain Rizvi could have easily been arrested on the grounds of inciting violence and rebellion, but he was not. The Pakistani army has mastered the art of managing extremist elements, using them, controlling them. This is not the first time radical Muslims have taken over law and order in the country. It is a nurturing and controlling of a living weapon. On November 26, 2017, Tehreek-e-Labbaik was a little-known party. Yet, through sheer strength of violence, it brought three cities of Pakistan — Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Faisalabad — to a halt. The incident, which came to be known the  , was in protest against the changes in the oath administered to ministers, in which the Khatam-e-Naboowat clause had been amended. The Khatam-e-Naboowat oath is an assertion of the finality of the Prophet, and all public servants have to swear it before joining office. Faisalabad town was jammed, the army was called in, and Tehreek-e-Labbaik shot to fame. After initial clashes, Rs-1000 notes were distributed to quell off the protests and help restore normalcy. Instead of coming down at them with a heavy hand, Labaik was rewarded. On top of that, the Islamabad High Court  over its ‘insensitivity’ towards the feelings of Muslims, and declared that prima facie, the amendment was a deliberate effort to bring the blasphemous Qadiyanis into government. The hardliners were elated and emboldened. Now, when Tehreek-e-Labbaik threatened rebellion against the Army chief and Imran Khan’s government, the Army sent out a notice that it should not be dragged into everything. The question is, why does it drag itself into everything? Why did it so brazenly encourage a little-known hardliner group, when it is skilled at ruthless tactics of imposing itself, such as the ones it uses to suppress the insurgency in Balochistan? The Military-Mullah nexus of Pakistan is not something the Deep State can hide anymore. It is the entrenched reality, which lawyer-activist Asma Jahangir kept reminding the world of. “ (with folded hands, I beg you to go back to the barracks now),” she thundered on a news show once. Pakistan’s reality has never been put in words better. Sadly, after a retort by the Imran Khan government that the rule of law would prevail over sentiments, the normal routine unfolded again. Tehreek-e-Labbaik has made an agreement with the state. One day after the verdict, another petition would be accepted in the SC. The rioters who burnt down property, engaged in loot and arson would be set free. Asia would be  , banning her from leaving the country. The government of Pakistan, instead of hanging her itself, chose to outsource her killing. It effectively signed her death warrant, as the ‘liberal democracies’ of the world watched. The state of Pakistan not only didn’t defy the hardliners, it once again surrendered jurisdiction to them and their methods. This choice fans the fires in Europe, the US, and even India. As political analyst Harbir Singh points out, Global Islamism is one of the principle reasons for the rise of the Right in democracies around the world. The Global Left’s refusal to stand for and protect minorities in Muslim-majority countries, and their having failed to take Muslim refugees from Syria, is one of the major reasons for the Right gathering strength across western democracies, from Alternate for Germany (AdF) to People’s Party of Slovakia. It is for the liberal Muslims to stand up for our minorities, demand that governments provide absolute protection, dignity and rights to them. It has to start with Muslims living safely out of reach of groups like the Tehreek-e-Labbaik and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan — namely India’s Muslims, and the Pakistani and other South Asian Muslims living safely in the West. Our voices have to be as decisive and loud as they are when we demand justice for Palestine or Kashmir. The Mullahs have brought their war to our doorsteps, and moderate peaceful Muslims cannot stick their heads in the sand anymore.",2018-11-04,"Imran Khan,Tehreek-e-labbaik,Pakistan,Asia bibi verdict",Pakistan burns over Asia Bibi: High time liberal Muslims spoke up for their minorities,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/asia-bibi-acquitted-protests-in-pakistan-tehreek-i-labaik-general-bajwa-imran-khan/story/1/27616.html
107,SY Quraishi,"The absence of a law for the appointment of Commissioners to the Election Commission of India has recently been highlighted by the Supreme Court, by referring a PIL on the subject . The plea has requested the court to direct the Parliament “to make law for ensuring a fair, just and transparent process of selection by constituting a neutral and independent collegium/selection committee to recommend the name for the appointment of member to the Election Commission”. Article 324(2) lays down that the President of India shall fix the number of Election Commissioners in a manner he sees fit. Further, Article 327 states that “Parliament may from time to time by law make provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections...” But the ruling dispensations have evaded their responsibility as they do not want to let go of this power. Even though the Parliament brought in a Bill in 1991 to specify the terms of service, it fell short of making a law for the appointment of Commissioners. Over the years, the commissioners have occasionally been accused of being stooges of the government that appointed them, even though no misconduct has ever been proven. This is a source of anguish and annoyance for the commissioners concerned, who have dedicated their lives to doing their constitutional duty with fierce impartiality. In one case, no less than   to the President of India, seeking dismissal of his fellow commissioner.  The demand for appointment of ECs through a collegium has received broad support from within the EC, and the civil society at large. In 2006, CEC BB Tandon wrote to then-President APJ Abdul Kalam, requesting that just like the NHRC and the Central Vigilance Commission, the appointments of the Election Commissioners be made through a committee, consisting of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha along with Leader of Opposition etc. CEC Gopalaswamy in 2009 wrote a similar letter to the President. I have also voiced the same concern publicly over and over again since 2010. Prominent political figures have also lent their support to the collegium system over the years. For instance, in June 2012,  to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that the current system of appointments was partisan and prone to manipulation, and so, the involvement of representation from the Opposition be considered in appointments of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Chief Election Commissioner. The Law Commission of India   on electoral reforms in 2015 recommended de-politicisation of constitutional appointments, and that “it is of paramount importance to ensure that the ECI, entrusted with the task of conducting elections throughout the country, be fully insulated from political pressure or executive interference to maintain the purity of elections, inherent in a democratic process”. The LCI went further to specify that the President should appoint the Election Commissioners based on a broad based collegium, consisting of the Leader of Opposition and the CJI, apart from the PM as the Chairperson.  The apex court itself in 2017 had observed that even though the appointments to the Commission   “very, very fair and politically neutral”, there was a need for a proper process so that the officials responsible for the conduct of elections in our country are appointed using the “most transparent and just process”. The sacredness of an institution cannot be based on the faith that all appointees will continue to be fair and apolitical in the future too. The past few months have seen  and the media questioning the credibility of the EC, and the transparency in its functioning. The ECI has been called some shocking and shameful names. This underlines an urgent need to legislate on the issue, to put the matter to rest once and for all. Along with the appointment, the system of removal of Election Commissioners also needs review. The present system discriminates against the commissioners. While they have equal powers/ vote in the functioning of the Commission, they feel they are on probation as the government can remove them on just the CEC’s recommendation. The protection given to the CEC from removal must extend to all three commissioners. It is often contended that the judiciary should not “overreach”, and the matter should be best left to the Parliament in accordance with the doctrine of “separation of powers”. But I must point out that “separation of powers” has to be viewed with another constitutional doctrine of “checks and balances”. A democracy is only as effective as its institutions, and depoliticising key constitutional and statutory appointments is the most crucial element. When the collegium system is considered necessary for NHRC, CIC, CVC and the judges, what is the rationale for leaving out ECI and CAG? These appointments too should not only be fair and transparent, they should institutionally be made bipartisan and transparent as well. National interest has to prevail over party interests. Judicial intervention is the only option left when the other two branches of the government have failed to act for seven decades. The credibility of the ECI must be protected at all costs, if our democracy has to survive. Let’s hope the constitution bench buries the controversy permanently.",2018-11-04,"NHRC,Collegium,Supreme Court,Election commissioners",Why the Supreme Court is right in reviewing the appointment process of Election Commissioners,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/election-commission-supreme-court-appointment-of-commissioners-to-the-election-commission-of-india-referred-to-constitutional-bench/story/1/27621.html
108,Shubhankar Dam,"The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) is at it again. So is the Rashtriya Sywamsevak Sangh (RSS). With the Supreme Court putting away hearings on the Ayodhya dispute to an uncertain date, an ordinance chant has taken over. The political devotees of Lord Ram want his birthplace, his shrine, consecrated by legislation. They want it now. “Hindus are running out of patience,”  , a central minister, scowled ominously. “No one knows what may happen if they run out of patience”. Singh and his acolytes apparently believe the Supreme Court is dilly-dallying deliberately. They seemingly think a parliamentary legislation — or ordinance — is an elegant way out: seize the matter from the judges; consign the disputed land to Hindu sects; deny Muslims any claim to it; settle the weary dispute forever.  Should the Modi government oblige? Legally speaking, can it oblige? Fight past the fog of faith, devotion, politics and rage. The Ayodhya controversy waiting there is a banal, private matter — one piece of land, many claimants. Who’s the rightful owner? Courts have been at it, trying, stumbling at times, avoiding, for six decades now. Can Parliament simply grab the suit, and legislate away the dispute? Parliament is India’s supreme lawmaker. 'Supremacy', though, is a misleading idea. While it may make laws at any time, Parliament can’t make laws on whatever topic it wishes. Constrains apply. Obviously, it can’t make laws that violate the Constitution. To legislate what the VHP advocates means that Parliament must confiscate a private dispute pending in court, and impose a resolution by law. Effectively, MPs must play judges. Can they do so?   They can’t. One: We have a judicial branch for a reason. That is where disputes are decided, especially between private litigants. Empowering Parliament to commandeer cases under litigation renders the judicial branch discretionary. The court system — judges, lawyers, litigants — may function, but only so long as Parliament, benevolently, stays out. Once it gets involved, judges must surrender their docket. Separation of powers is dead this way. Surely, that cannot be. Two: Courts don’t just adjudicate disputes. They do so in a particular way. They summon a forensic lens: identify relevant facts, corroborate evidence, cross-examine witnesses, analyse precedents. Above all, they reason. Now and then, they may fall short. But the standard is clear. Parliament, though, has no similar standard. It may act on principles; it may not. It may legislate after careful analyses; it may not. It may speak only through the grammar of electoral politics. Often, it does.   Wrenching disputes away from courts deny litigants their right to judicial process. Indians have a right to access to justice, the Supreme Court has repeatedly intoned. Access, however, matters only if it culminates in a process — the forensic process of adjudication. Granting Parliament the power to seize dockets destroys the judicial process. Surely, that cannot be. Three: Such a law also tugs at the litigants’ right to equality. Courts are besieged by a crushing docket.  , some grayer than this one, are pending in courtrooms across India. Why should MPs pick one — just one — from a bottomless pile? Why deny these litigants their right to judicial process? They have the right to equality like anyone else suffering the slow grind of Indian justice.  The law that the VHP, RSS and their groups demand is unequivocally unconstitutional. It would render a core constitutional idea (separation of powers), a core institution (judicial process) and a core fundamental right (equality) irrelevant. If not a parliamentary legislation, an ordinance perhaps? The VHP has demanded the latter, too. Ordinances are like parliamentary laws, but are made by the executive. Can the Modi government summon an ordinance on Ayodhya? It can’t. Governments may promulgate ordinances only on matters legislators may make laws on. If Parliament can’t legislate on Ayodhya now, the government, too, can’t. The ordinance route is closed. Ordinances, though, confront another hurdle. They are permitted only if laws are immediately needed, and Parliament isn’t at hand to legislate. It is true that political parties without exception have abused this sly method, and gotten away with it. But new rules are in place now. After dithering for long, in 2017, the Supreme Court finally held the obvious — ministerial decisions to promulgate ordinances   in courts. If promulgated, an Ayodhya ordinance will invite a legal challenge. Can the Modi government defend its necessity? Hardly. Placating the VHP is no reason for an ordinance. Nor is the alleged delay. The suit has gingerly inched towards a final hearing. To intervene now is to erect an undue barrier. An Ayodhya ordinance will face constitutional headwinds in the court. So, once admitted, must all cases always be decided only in courts? Can Parliament never intervene? It can — but only if the case isn’t a private dispute. Courts often engage in policy matters through Public Interest Litigations: Should a city have three airports? Should the state sell natural resources only by auction? Should commercial surrogacy be allowed? Parliament is free to intervene in such matters, even if they are pending before judges.  The Ayodhya dispute, though, is a different one. Private parties want a court to assess their competing claims to a piece of land. Judges alone can decide that — not MPs, not ministers. A constitutional system is what we, the people, make of it. We will make a mess of it by trying to resolve the Ayodhya dispute in Parliament.",2018-11-02,"BJP,Supreme Court,Ayodhya dispute,Ordinance on ram mandir",Can the government actually take the legislation route on the Ayodhya dispute?

The only time public meetings or road shows are organised are when Congress president Rahul Gandhi is in the state. Once the Congress president leaves, there is a lull in campaign activity. On the other hand, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan is continuing to hold public meetings across the state. The absence of Congress leaders from the campaign seems to be a result of the focus on ticket distribution, meetings for which usually take place in Delhi, in the presence of the High Command and central leaders. Deliberations on ticket distribution have taken longer than usual for the Congress this time, perhaps because the party wants to be doubly sure about candidate selection — which undoubtedly is the most important pre election exercise. The withdrawal of Congress leaders from the campaign has left the field open for BJP leaders to exploit. The domination in the field eventually leads to domination in the minds of the voters — something that can result in a rich harvest of votes from among the ranks of undecided voters for the political party that has mastered it. Campaigning galvanises workers which is a must for the Congress given that it is pitted against a cadre based party. The impact of the withdrawal of the Congress or conversely, the presence of BJP leaders, has been amply reflected in political surveys. In June, the first pre-election survey gave the Congress a massive lead in MP. It was enough to excite Congress leaders about the prospects of victory — coming as they did after 15 years of being in political wilderness — but more importantly, it spurned CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan to action. He launched his jan ashirwad yatra — a mass contact programme, in mid July. The next prominent survey showed the BJP in a neck-and-neck fight, with Shivraj being more popular as a CM candidate. Since then, Shivraj Singh Chouhan has tried very hard to not vacate that space to the Congress. Even though tickets are being finalised in the BJP too, the party still manages to get some of its top leaders and even Chouhan to hold a few public meetings. Not the same for the Congress where the top two are in campaign mode only when their party president is in the state. Between Rahul Gandhi’s last two visits to Gwalior and Indore, there was a total lull in activity as was the case between his visit to Rewa. PCC president Kamal Nath does not see a problem with the lull in campaigning. “The reason why we are not campaigning is because the lesson we learnt from Gujarat and Karnataka was that we peaked at the wrong time. So what we are doing is by design,” said Kamal Nath. Perhaps, campaigning will pick up after ticket distribution, but if voters make up their minds now, it would be a permanent damage to Congress prospects.

110,Shantanu Mukharji,"As Bangladesh gears up for the next parliamentary elections, political heat has been raised a notch higher with a slew of dramatic developments. The Dhaka High Court in a landmark judgment on October 30 enhanced the quantum of punishment to former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia   – thus completely sealing her fate and forbidding her from contesting the elections. In other words, Prime Minister Hasina’s principal opponent is now out of the fray and the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has been left bereft of their only charismatic leader who can pull of successful rallies ahead of the coming elections. The other leader, Tareq Rahman, son of begum Zia and party supremo is sheltered in London and remains disabled to come to Dhaka as he is also a convict and remains beleaguered. Significantly, Khaleda Zia is the only Bangladeshi former prime minister to face conviction. She has been in and out of jail before, but this time she is convicted and now undergoing a sentence. Here, it would be pertinent to mention that the High Court passed the judgment after hearing the recommendation of the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) seeking enhancement of punishment in the infamous draft case pertaining to an orphanage. The judiciary has thus severed the political jugular vein of Khaleda and her BNP decimating their political future – and possibly even survival. Coincidentally, in another interesting and important development, ruling Awami League (AL) leader and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had extended a formal invitation to hold a dialogue at her official residence on November 1 with Gono Forum (GF) leader, Dr Kamal Hossain who is also heading the Jatiya Oikya (National Unity) Front. This is in response to Dr Hossain’s request for a dialogue with regard to his charter of demands which among other things include elections under a non partisan government, the full independence of judiciary, freeing MPs from the stringent restrictions imposed on them under Article 70 of the constitution and the most pressing demand of them all, the release of Khaleda Zia. Until now, Dr Kamal Hossain had another partner, former President of Bangladesh, Dr Badrudozza Choudhury in his Oikya Front who has since parted because of sharp irreconcilable differences. It appears surprising that Dr Kamal is pitching in for Khaleda’s release and he knows it well that at the November 1 dialogue, this demand is almost impossible to be met. Also, Dr Hossain has been one of the closest lieutenants of the founding father of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the first foreign minister of the country. And, his long association with AL and loyalty with SK Mujib doesn’t behoove his stature to canvass for BNP and Khaleda. A constitution expert of extraordinary calibre, Dr Kamal has no grassroots support and has never won an election. He is articulate, affable and his grip on international relations have always seen him through in negotiations with global leaders but at the ground level, his track record is dismal and, therefore, his electoral prospects have no promise. With Hasina’s astuteness, she is very unlikely to grant any leeway to Kamal Hossain. Having said that, it would be sheer curiosity for political pundits to see what transpires at the dialogue on November 1. In the meantime, Bikalpa Dhara chief, former President of Bangladesh, Dr Badrudozza Choudhury, has also sought a time with Prime Minister Hasina for discussing election-linked plans. This comes in the wake of Dr Kamal Hossain's initiative to meet the AL party president and plead for Khaleda‘s release. However, in complete contrast to Dr Kamal’s stance, Dr Badrudozza Choudhury is expected not to raise Khaleda issue. His meeting is just fixed for November 2. It may be recapitulated that Dr Choudhury is opposed to Jamaat being a partner in any seat sharing. Hence, November 2 is equally significant to watch for. PM Hasina, on her part, has amply demonstrated that she is engaging her political adversaries in dialogues, and as such evaded any criticism of being seen as autocratic. Her political astuteness will automatically silence her detractors and western critics paving the way for free and fair elections. Meanwhile, the Election Commission of Bangladesh has scrapped the registration of Jamaat e Islami (JeI) as a political party on October 28 under article 90 H(4) of the Representation of the People’s Order (RPO) 1972. Hence this party – a long time partner of BNP – also stands decimated. As things stand today, political developments in Bangladesh will gain more momentum in the next couple of months raising the political temperature to a fever pitch.",2018-11-02,"Bangladesh nationalist party,Khaleda Zia,Sheikh Hasina,General elections",Why Bangladesh is witnessing hectic politicking ahead of coming elections,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bangladesh-general-elections-sheikh-hasina-prime-minister-khaleda-zia-bangladesh-nationalist-party/story/1/27579.html
111,Sanjukta Basu,"Dear Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Congratulations, you’ve got your own statue now. It is the tallest in the world. I am not sure if you wanted this, but you’ve got it, so enjoy. Please do send a thank you card from heaven to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, because apparently four and a half years back, you did not exist. You are apparently nothing without Modi, you know that? You made the wrong friends all your life — Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi and all those unscrupulous people, who only gave you Patel Chowks and assorted roads and called you the ‘Iron Man of India’. It means nothing. Modi gave you real recognition — a statue, the world’s tallest one at that. It was VD Savarkar then, and Modi now, that you should thus always be loyal to. But then, you banned Savarkar’s Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for carrying out terror activities, didn’t you? One small life hack for you, as you make Gujarat your new abode — do not ask Modi any questions. Modi doesn’t like questions. You might note that since you’ve been gone,  . Modi himself was Chief Minister during the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the state and he never expressed remorse, condolence or apologies for it. But do not ask anything about the values of secularism for which you worked so hard. Modi and his friends don't like secularism either, it seems. Modi says we shouldn’t do politics over your statue. I have never heard anything more naïve. Statues are politics. Period. There is no other reason for statues to exist on any landscape other than establishing one’s politics and authority. Statues are one of the key instruments of ‘ideological state apparatus’. From the statue of   to those of the  , to Vladimir Lenin’s statue in Manipur, we pull down statues, we erect statues, we learn our nation’s politics through statues. We compete for political power and recognition through statues. When Lenin’s statue was violently pulled down in Manipur, no less than the state’s  . 
 
 Statues also gain popularity, and become tourist attractions, purely for their politics. Seldom has a statue become interesting just because of its size or aesthetics. For that matter, statues by themselves, without the politics, can be pretty boring, with birds pooping on them. The Statue of Liberty became a global attraction not because everybody wanted to go see a pretty lady holding a torch. No. It is loved and revered today for the eternal message it gives out, in the words of Emma Lazarus, which forms the foundation of the statue, for representing America as a great torch-bearing nation, ready to accept weak and vulnerable people from all over the world and give them hope, inspiration, and freedom. Statues have politics and Modi built one for you too, to peddle his own politics. You see, Modi and his party apparently wish to rule India for 50 years. The idea might disappoint you, because all that hard work you did, of uniting over 500 princely states into one sovereign nation, has gone for a toss now. Relentlessly and painstakingly, you initiated dialogues with the rulers and convinced them of why they should join India, a secular democracy and not Pakistan, a theocracy. When India gained freedom, the cynics thought it was impossible for a country as diverse as ours, with a bloodied history of colonialism, riddled with poverty and illiteracy, to survive as a nation. They thought in just a few years, there would be infighting and we would disintegrate. But we proved everybody wrong. Our unity in diversity is a political miracle for the world, particularly the European Union, which looks up to us for inspiration as they  . Who gave India the ‘Unity in Diversity’ slogan? Whose notion was it to produce and promote public service announcements, spreading messages like ‘Hindu Muslim Sikh Isai, apas mein sab bhai bhai’? It was Nehru. All that is changing though under Modi and his party. But even the BJP knows that it does not help their case much when they do not have a single leader involved in either the nation’s freedom movement or in the growth story during the formative years. For long, they peddled a supposed hero who pathetically wrote an anonymous article in which he anointed himself as ""Veer"". Even Rahul Gandhi, who had so far not taken any names, hit out directly at Savarkar and his letters of apology to British government, in  . The fact is, when future generations will ask the BJP-RSS and the Sangh Parivar about their role in India’s growth during the first 50 years, they would have no answers. The BJP is therefore desperate to appropriate the legacy of leaders like Subhash Chandra Bose and Sardar Patel by constantly pitting them against Nehru. That is the very DNA of this party. They pit one caste, one religion against another and gain political mileage out of the enmity. It is shameful that they have not even spared our forefathers and divided them into camps. But the truth is that all of you — Nehru, Bose, Ambedkar, Patel and many more — were all on the same side. And nobody, I repeat, nobody was on the RSS’s side. Lastly, Sardar, coming to the cost of your statue, about Rs 2,989 crore, and its relevance in peoples lives, I have bad news which would not make you happy. “The Statue of Unity, built at an estimated cost of Rs 2,989 crore, could have instead funded two new Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campuses, five Indian Institute of Management (IIM) campuses and six Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) missions to Mars,”  . They have named it ‘Statue of Unity’ too, but people are not united over it as there are  , who have reportedly been displaced due to its construction. You might have received   in this regard, where she listed out the plight of the adivasis. The government promises acche din for the statue as they claim it would become a great tourist attraction and generate lots of jobs. But  , “Even if Statue of Unity becomes as famous as Taj Mahal, we may need 120 years to break even.” Let’s admit it, Sardar — your statue will not become more famous than Taj Mahal. For whatever reasons, you just do not have international appeal. To gain that level of tourist attraction, Modi should have made a Gandhi statue. Because there are two things the whole world knows about India —Taj Mahal and Mahatma Gandhi. Don’t get me wrong, Sardar, I am all for a statue for you, but I really wish they spent less money on it, didn’t displace adivasis, and really made it an occasion of unity, love, and solidarity, instead of pitting you against Nehru and making a mockery of our nation’s history.

112,Rasheed Kidwai,"This will be the last hurrah before 2019. For the Rahul Gandhi-led Congress, winning Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh is the one last chance to salvage its status as a credible, national-level opposition to the BJP. But unlike filmmaker Manmohan Desai of the 1980s, Rahul Gandhi is clueless about a winning formula. He has been to temples, mosques, even Kailash Mansarovar, criss-crossed thousands of kilometres, held road shows and public rallies without getting a clear clue if his party is winning Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan or Chhattisgarh. The in-house pollsters have, however, given him a glimmer of hope. Three poll surveys conducted by  and in-house managers have given Congress a clear majority in the central and western Indian states. In bravado, Rahul junked the idea of a grand alliance or a mahagathbandan in these three states, opting for a high risk ‘winner takes it all’ approach. The Congress president is of the view that unless his party wins the three — or at least two — of these states on its own strength, the 2019 Lok Sabha contest will end up as a one-horse race. A good showing in Telengana, and retaining Mizoram, would, of course, be a bonus. Winning MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh is crucial for the Congress not just in terms of victory, but for its very survival. The Congress’ political presence in big states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Tamil Nadu is negligible. It is part of coalition politics in states such as Karnataka, Jharkhand, J&K, Kerala, Telegana, Assam, and Maharashtra. It has lost political relevance in Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Odisha and some north-eastern stares. A victory in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh will, therefore, not only boost the morale of a beleaguered Rahul, but showcase the party as one capable of taking on Narendra Modi and as a national alternative to the BJP.      The Congress now needs to field candidates who are capable of winning elections. This is one area where the party lacks confidence, or a fool-proof technique. Having been out of power both at the Centre and in states (except for poll-bound Mizoram), the Congress does not have any feedback from intelligence agencies, police or the bureaucracy (it is a different matter that projections and feedback from the Intelligence Bureau tend to be highly unreliable and inaccurate). Rahul is in a fix about whether to implement the old practice of “setting –getting”, or fielding sitting MLAs of the outgoing Assemblies. At the constituency level, there is a trend of anti-incumbency. In the absence of a clear, empirical exercise, the option of fielding a sitting MLA is fraught with dangers. On the other hand, denying ticket to a seemingly unpopular incumbent has its own hazards, as caste equations and the inability to measure the exact amount of disillusionment against the MLA can be risky. These are the perils of parliamentary democracy, where the leader faces a real danger of regretting his decisions at leisure, and warming Opposition benches endlessly.   The Congress also has a history of according importance to its regional satraps and giving them a decisive say in ticket distribution and selection of party nominees. Here too, Rahul faces Hobson’s choice. Ignoring the advice or recommendations of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Digvijaya Singh,  Kamal Nath, Ashok Gehlot, Sachin Pilot or Motilal Vora is easy for Rahul, but in the event of adverse results, would he be able to own up responsibility and hold himself accountable For the uninitiated, it may be mentioned here that since the time of Sonia Gandhi, the Congress’ central election committee has maintained a practice of recording the recommendation, or the party president’s observation, in favour of a selected candidate. These paper trails are not made public, but are certainly available to influential Congress leaders, including central election committee members. Congress insiders say that at least on one count, Rahul has been far more successful than mother Sonia Gandhi, who holds the record of being the longest-serving AICC chief. Rahul has been remarkably successful in striking a balance among regional satraps. In Rajasthan, for instance, the party chief has been successful in getting the best from both Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot. In Madhya Pradesh, his childhood buddy Jyotiraditya Scindia has teamed up well with 71-year old warhorse Kamal Nath. Pilot is often seen offering pillion rides to Gehlot on his motorbike, while Scindia is seen having ice cream with Nath. The body language among competitors is one of ease In Chhattisgarh too, Rahul has succeeded in making all regional players, such as Bhupesh Baghel, TS Singhdeo, Charan Das Mahant and Ravindra Choubey, cooperate in the electoral contest.       While in-house revolts and factionalism is minimal, the issue of outsiders, defectors from other political parties, members of NGOs, former bureaucrats, farm sector leaders, etc. knocking at the Congress’ door for party nomination has provided a problem of plenty.  In addition, new political parties are mushrooming. As per the Election Commission, 58 new parties have been registered between June and September this year. A   in   says that eight of the new entrants are from Rajasthan, five from Telangana, three from Madhya Pradesh and one from Mizoram. While it is unclear how many votes outfits such as the Samanya Pichhada Evam Alpsankhyak Varg Samaj (General, Backward and Minority Welfare Society), better known as SAPAKS Samaj — an organisation born out of opposition to the reservation policy in jobs, promotion and education — and Jai Adivasi Yuva Sangathan (JAYS) would get in Madhya Pradesh, but there are reasons for Rahul to worry about rise of ‘vote-katua” (voter splitter) parties and individuals.    ",2018-10-31,"Madhya pradesh polls,Rajasthan elections,Chhattisgarh assembly polls,Rahul Gandhi","MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh polls are battle of survival for Congress.

113,Soumyadipta Banerjee,"There are three kinds of Pakistan that exist today — and each kind has no connection with the other.  The first one is Imran Khan's 'Naya Pakistan', a Pakistan that is self-sufficient, economically strong and a military superpower in the south Asian region. The second Pakistan is the Pakistan that the verified Pakistani Twitter handles project — a liberal Pakistan which allows minorities to thrive and a democratic system which is governed by the rule of law. The third Pakistan is the Pakistan that exists in reality.  This Pakistan is diametrically opposite to the first two Pakistans. This Pakistan is broke, ruled by a mob of religious fanatics, completely intolerant of the minorities and governed by a Deep State that consists mainly of the military and the ISI. Every now and then, there comes an incident that lays bare this true nature of Pakistan — a state that is so deeply fanatical to the core that any kind of logical argument will fail to describe it.  One of the cases in point is that of Asia Bibi. Bibi is a minority Christian woman who was accused of   as the majority Pakistani Muslim ladies and then allegedly engaging in an argument with them. The police complaint and the investigation reports narrated the argument only from the point of view of the accusers and never really took into account the actual narrative of Asia Bibi. Asia Bibi, as a result, was sentenced to death and remained on death row for nine years.  The country's true face was exposed once again when two prominent lawmakers were gunned down just because they dared to speak in favour of Asia Bibi.  The   was gunned down by his own security guard because he spoke in favour of Asia Bibi and demanded that she be released immediately. He also wanted to end the misuse of blasphemy laws that have already claimed hundreds of lives in Pakistan, including its dwindling minority communities who live without dignity in most Pakistani provinces.  Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri, the 26-year-old security guard, was convicted of the crime and hanged in 2016. But true to the social fabric of Pakistan, Qadri is now regarded as a martyr — and not an assassin. Believe it or not, his grave is actually a   site in Pakistan. Another person who was murdered on the same lines was the only Christian minority federal minister in Pakistan, Shahbaz Bhatti.  His life was in danger for a long time and according to reports, even the CIA had unsuccessfully tried to convince the ISI that Bhatti needed an armoured, bullet-proof car. It is rumoured that the ISI didn't allow the CIA to supply Bhatti with an armoured car, despite having specific inputs about his murder. Why? Because the ISI, it is rumoured, apparently wanted to eliminate him to please some of the religious fanatics. He died exactly as predicted and there was just lip-services from people in power in that country as the Pakistan  .  Soon, Asia Bibi's case came up for a final hearing among frenzied slogans through the country. Given the kind of public sentiment Pakistani vernacular newspapers were portraying, everybody thought Asia Bibi would be sent to the gallows.  However, to everybody's surprise, good sense prevailed and in a   Asia Bibi was declared innocent and spared her life. But the question that is perturbing me is — 'Does she really walk free?' Immediately after the judgement was delivered, members of a known fanatic but legitimate religious organisation called Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP)  . Its supporters blocked roads and highways. This is the same party that has been releasing videos on social media, threatening to kill the judges in this case, and imploring their ""soldiers"" to prepare for the ultimate sacrifice.  Here's proof. 
 
 Don't think that this party doesn't enjoy public support in Pakistan — this is actually the fifth largest party in that country, with a wide base of supporters who can choke the living daylights out of a civilised nation. As I write this, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) is engaged in destroying public property and unleashing a reign of terror among the poor public.  This is the true face of Pakistan — a country carved out of our own but which has ever since walked down the path of religious fanaticism.  Forget about its 'good terrorist' and 'bad terrorist' policy that we heavily criticise on international platforms, the rudderless and spineless Pakistani administration is actually party to a series of skewed legislations that is ensuring the minority population slowly gets wiped out from its land. In different parts of the country, minorities are reportedly being killed, abducted or intimidated regularly. You can simply read the  on religious discrimination in Pakistan to get an idea about how bad the situation is and why the minority population is dwindling day by day.  That is the Pakistan social media liberals don't talk about — but, ladies and gentlemen, that is its true face.  Pakistan is a country which denies you your basic rights if you are a Hindu or a Christian or a Ahmadi. The rights definitely exist on paper —but on the ground, it's a totally different — and opposite — story. Do you think a person like Asia Bibi will be able to live in such a country, even if she is deemed innocent by the Supreme Court of Pakistan?  If Asia Bibi is not provided with an army cordon as security, the day is not far when you will see her dead body on social media. As I speak, several legitimate political parties and their leaders are openly baying for her blood, imploring their members to kill her to get a passport to heaven.  In my view, Pakistan, as a country, has fallen to such depths that it won't be able to salvage itself for centuries — but, we, the civilised nations, should not stand there and let her be attacked on our watch. Asia Bibi should be immediately granted asylum to a safe country — India should be the first country to raise this issue at an international forum. Asia Bibi must live in security and peace because she is a symbol of the failure of religious zealots who otherwise get to have a free run in Pakistan.

114,Shuja-ul-Haq,"In the early 90’s when armed militancy had just begun in Kashmir, the sight of men carrying guns on their shoulders and moving in lines on the streets was nothing unusual. But what was different was the kind of weapons these men would carry. While policeman and CRPF personnel would usually be seen with old 303 rifles or SLR’s, the militants had swanky new AK47’s. Sometimes they would even carry light machine guns and RPG propellers. For a long time, there was no competition between the two sides. The militants were armed with way better weapons and thus were guaranteed an upper hand. Things however changed in a few years when the government of those days realised the need to arm the security forces with equally modern weapons. The conflict in the valley has seen its ups and downs for close to 30 years now. In these years the graph and capacity of militant groups have also seen changes. If recent  are true, security forces in the Valley are now facing a new challenge in the form of sniper attacks by militants. Three personnel of the armed forces have been killed in the last one and a half months in Kashmir by these sniper attacks. Sources say that at least four militants of Jaish-e-Muhammad are involved in such attacks. “There are sniper attacks that are taking place. It is a new challenge which we are trying to combat particularly in South Kashmir”, said a senior police officer. On September 18 a CRPF jawan was injured in the Newa area of Pulwama. It was a long distance shot. Since then three fatal attacks have happened. One claiming the life of a Sashastra Seema Bal Jawan in Tral, and another killing an Army jawan again in the same area. The most recent one was an attack on CISF assistant sub-inspector in Nowgam of Srinagar. As per sources in the security forces there are four militants who are carrying out these targeted attacks. They work in two teams mostly in South Kashmir. Senior officials suggest that these militants have been highly trained by their groups across the line of control and have been sent to the Valley. It is also being suspected that they are using M-4 carbines, used by the US-led allied forces in Afghanistan. Some of these rifles were recovered earlier by the police from militants in the valley confirming their presence. Since these attacks are taking place during night times in the valley, the forces also suspect that these gunmen are also equipped with night vision gadgets. In most of these attacks, the personnel were targeted while they were outside their posts using their mobile phones. Sources in the security forces say that the militants can target a person at a distance of 500-600 meters in such attacks. The presence of sniper militants has also sent alarm bells ringing among those who deal with the VIP security. Former Jammu Kashmir chief minister, Omar Abdullah, commented on the reports of such attacks. He said: ""We've dealt with snipers on the border and LoC regularly and have SOPs to deal with those but never in the hinterland. This will force a rethink of all manner of security and protection procedures,"" he tweeted. 
 
 So why is the presence of armed snipers such a big deal? Firstly, it is new even for this decades-old conflict; secondly, the armed snipers with night vision capabilities will change the rules of the game. If all this is true the security forces won't feel entirely safe even behind their camp walls. Then comes the question of VVIP security which would need a massive review in such a situation when snipers can hit at long distances. In short, a lot of recalibration would be needed by the forces to tackle this new challenge in front of them.",2018-10-30,"Terrorism,Militancy,LoC,Jammu and Kashmir",Why militants using sniper weapons in the Valley is a major challenge to the security forces,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sniper-jammu-and-kashmir-loc-militancy-terrorism/story/1/27525.html
115,Sushant Sareen,"For years, itinerant activists and self-appointed advisors have advocated a political solution to the so-called Kashmir problem. Strangely, however, none of these characters have ever spelt out what this amorphous political solution is. There is a sort of fuzziness in even describing what exactly the political problem to which they are advocating a political solution. But it isn’t only the Kashmir careerists who are fuzzy about Kashmir. New Delhi, or if you will, the Delhi Durbar, is just as confused. Even though the political and bureaucratic establishment (including the military) never stops talking about a political solution, there is always a tendency to appoint a former bureaucrat, spymaster or general as Delhi’s representative in the state. In other words, the governor has invariably been a non-politician who has been picked up on the basis his savvy of security and administrative matters. It is assumed that coupled with their administrative skills, the fact that these people who have successfully climbed the greasy pole during their careers are adept in traversing the treacherous world of politics; they are ideally suited to for the governorship of a sensitive state like Jammu and Kashmir. To an extent, given the security challenges that the state confronts, there is some merit in this argument. But both by instinct and by training, an official’s mind behaves and reacts differently from that of a politician. In Kashmir, while the security dimension of the problem cannot be ignored, nor can the political dimension. If anything, politics and security have to move in tandem. But often enough, when the situation deteriorates, the security approach tends to be prioritised over the political approach. For the first time, the Modi government bucked the trend by appointing a quintessential politician, Satyapal Malik, as governor to succeed the former bureaucrat NN Vohra. The appointment of Malik was nothing if not counter-intuitive, especially at a time when a new and more virulent form of militancy and terrorism is unfolding in J&K. Normally, given the resurgence in terrorism, coupled with the collapse of the political government, the stock response of Delhi would have been to appoint an administrator, a security czar of sorts who would clean up the mess. No surprise then that when Malik was shifted from Patna to Srinagar, it raised many eyebrows, more so since Malik had neither background in security management nor was known to be a Kashmir hand. In retrospect, this appears to be a masterstroke. The appointment of a political governor sent a strong signal that the government of India prefers a political approach rather than a purely security-oriented approach. What is more, since Malik didn’t come with any baggage of being either a Kashmir hand or a security expert, he was ideally placed to assess the situation with an open mind. And most importantly, unlike the apologists for the separatists, who are always trying to appease and accommodate them, Malik has thinly disguised contempt for the separatist conglomerate. He has expressed this in his own inimitable style: the Hurriyet cannot even go to the toilet without seeking permission from their Pakistani masters! Malik appears mindful of the dangerous new turn that terrorism has taken in Kashmir. The syncretic and quite unique Kashmiri Islam is steadily being taken over by an alien Islamist death cult that is inspired by radical movements in the Middle East and AfPak region. He has good and interesting ideas on how to wean away the youth from the nihilistic path and build a counter-narrative that combats the pernicious ideology of the separatists and Islamists. While he has let the security professionals handle the security side of the problem, he has focussed on the political and administrative side. Not only is he trying to address the governance deficit that has fed into to separatist narrative, but he is also kickstarting the political process that had gone into a limbo after the PDP-BJP coalition collapsed. Unimpressed, undaunted and undeterred by the boycott call was given by ""mainstream"" political parties like PDP and NC, Malik went ahead and held the long-delayed elections to the Urban Local Bodies. He is now all set to hold the Panchayat elections. And setting the cat among the pigeons, he has now hinted that since the present legislative assembly is dysfunctional, he is considering dissolving it and holding fresh elections. Politics abhors a vacuum. This immutable lesson of politics was ignored by the ‘mainstream’ parties who, in their own lack of wisdom and because they thought by boycotting the polls they could blackmail the government to cede them more space, shot themselves in the foot. By ignoring them, and going ahead with the elections, Malik has put the fear of marginalisation in them. A new crop of young politicians, smarter, more committed, more sincere than the older lot has grabbed the opportunity and come to the fore. By ceding space to this new lot of politicians, the old parties are now in a fix. There are a lot of rumblings among the cadre of these parties resenting the boycott. If they now continue their boycott, they risk irrelevance; if they participate, they will have to climb down their high horse, end the business of hedging their bets by running with the separatists and hunting with the state. In short, they will have to start taking clear, unambiguous positions on many issues. The old business of pandering to separatists even as they profited from the state will have to end if they have to remain relevant in politics. What is also scaring the hell out of the NC and PDP is the fact that if they boycott the assembly elections, they will pave the way for the BJP and Congress to capture the assembly and pass laws that could integrate the state with rest of the Union. The Modi government, like all its predecessors, has made its share of mistakes in Kashmir. It has failed to follow up on its crackdown on terror finance and money laundering networks. It has turned a blind eye to unconscionable corruption and maladministration. It has made Faustian bargains to grab power. It is a long list. But the one thing it has got right is putting a wise and cunning political man at the helm who has shaken up things much more than any babu or general could.

116,Kiran Tare,"At a time when he is completing four years in office on October 30, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is facing a crisis in his most ambitious scheme, the Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyan (JSA), meant for water conservation. The opposition has challenged it, after the government's self-assessment report mentioned that ground water level has gone down by more than one metre in 253 of 355 talukas (administrative division). About 167 of them are likely to face water scarcity this year. Inadequate rainfall, lack of water management, and indiscriminate use of water for irrigation are the reasons behind the grim situation. Fadnavis was quick to the situation in 180 talukas, but is likely to field a volley of questions on the state’s measures to tackle water scarcity in the near future. He said that the state had seen many droughts in the past, but this is the first time that the government has had to declare a “drought-like situation” in October itself. This year, the state has received only 77 per cent of its annual average rainfall. The CM has announced relief measures including concessions in land revenue pumps, 33.5 per cent concessions on agricultural pumps, concessions in students’ fees in rural areas, continued power supply to agricultural pumps, undertaking employment guarantee scheme works and deploying water tankers for drinking water. He said the Centre’s team will assess the drought-like situation soon. That has not satisfied the opposition. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar alleged that the JSA has failed as it was not implemented in a technically sound way. State Congress president Ashok Chavan alleged that the government has cheated the people by fudging records of the scheme’s so-called success. Fadnavis called the opposition’s criticism an attempt to insult the farmers and villagers who actively participated in JSA to make it a success. “We have been able to make 11,000 villages drought-free so far. Also, we could see farmers sowing on large areas in spite of rain deficiency,” he said. The drought in around 60 per cent of the state's area is not a good sign for the BJP government in election year. In the beginning of the monsoon, the government had patted its own back for providing drinking water and fodder without spending heavily on the cattle camps. Now, it will have to open cattle camps and start ferrying water tankers in the drought-prone areas. This will be an indirect admission of its helplessness in case of any water scarcity that may occur. Fadnavis will also have to make a provision of around Rs 10,000 crore to tackle the drought situation. That will be a huge burden on the state exchequer at a time when it is reeling under debt of Rs 4.20 lakh crore. Last year, Fadnavis had unsuccessfully proposed “drought tax” with an aim to raise funds to be used in drought affected areas. It seems he will have to reintroduce the proposal this time.

117,Yashee,"The BJP is the largest party in India, numerically and electorally. It is an extremely popular party. Its president, Amit Shah, is a powerful man, enjoying absolute, unquestioned authority within the organisation. When such an individual of the country to “not give verdicts that can’t be enforced”, and threatens to get his party cadre to “pull down” a government that is trying to enforce aN SC order, it is time to be very, very afraid. The situation is worsened when the principal Opposition party decides that its patent brand of selective secularism is more important than defending the rule of law. No matter what politicians say, the Sabarimala controversy is no longer a religious issue. It’s about whether “feelings” get to formally, officially, supersede the law. It’s an attempt to redefine who is the final arbiter of disputes — a Constitutionally sanctioned court of law — the highest in the country — or the politically stoked sentiments of a particular community.   In light of the impending Ayodhya hearings, the spectacle of the country’s largest political party making it clear that it will back mob over court — and the Opposition showing it won’t prevent it — becomes even more ominous.   The BJP is free to disagree with the Supreme Court verdict. It can file a review petition. As the party in power, it can bring in an ordinance against the verdict, like   in case of the court order on the SC/ST atrocities Act. But the party has not even spoken of these legal options. Instead, its party workers, along with disparate right wing groups, have laid siege at the temple. The party chief is formally blessing this local-level endeavor, openly speaking the language of threats — and violence. Shah  : “I have come to issue a warning to Pinarayi Vijayan. If you don’t stop this cycle of oppression, BJP workers will teach a lesson to your government. Your government will not last.” Governments are voted out by people in elections, not pulled down by rival parties. What 'lesson' is the BJP chief trying to teach another elected government here? He added: “I want to tell the (state) government and those who pronounce orders in court that you should issue orders that can be implemented, not the ones that break the faith of people.” Note that Shah is not criticising the Sabarimala verdict alone, he is apparently asking the court to not issue a certain type of verdict at all. What is the yardstick of deciding the implement-ebility of an order? Majority sentiments? The government’s will to implement them? Of course, politically, the BJP has much to win from the Sabarimala row — Hindu beliefs being “attacked” in a Communist-ruled state. If the government uses force against the protesters, the spectacle will be something the BJP will milk to the last drop. The saffron party has made it clear — law, democracy, faith are all expendable tools in the single-minded pursuit of electoral victory. But what about the Congress? Continuing with its image of “secular nationally, communal locally”, the Congress has steadily backed the “sentiments” of the Sabarimala devotees.   On October 29, Kerala MLA VT Balram did speak out in support of the LDF government,  his party “backed devotees, not vandals.” But this is not a distinction that can be made at this stage. At present, everyone opposing the entry of women of a certain age into the temple is obstructing the implementation of an SC order. If it at all wishes to live up to its “secular” credentials, the Congress needs to unequivocally state that it stands for the rule of law over the pulls of faith. It can always cater to the sentiments of its electorate by taking the legal route to get the SC verdict reversed. But the Congress, too, smells political gains here. It is hoping that the Nair Hindus, spearheading the protests, will get disenchanted with the Left, but as an alternative, will pick it over the BJP, for the Congress does have a stronger presence here than the saffron party in Kerala. However, there is an obvious flipside to this. One, the Congress is consistently allowing the BJP to set the agenda. Had it firmly backed the rule of law from Day One in the Sabarimala case, the protests would not have snowballed into the crisis they are today. Secondly, and more importantly, by making its secularism constantly subservient to political opportunitism, the party is destroying any claims to a higher moral ground over the BJP, and turning every election into competitive communalism.    Dark days are ahead.  ",2018-10-29,"Supreme Court,Congress,BJP,Sabarimala row","Sabarimala: BJP, Congress both think faith is above the law.

118,DailyO,"The  on October 26 has plunged the country into political turmoil, threatening to undermine the democratic progress made in the last three years, not to mention the balancing act in keeping both India and China in good humour. Wickramesinghe was removed by President Maithripala Sirisena after the United People's Freedom Alliance party (UPFA), the mainstay of which is President Sirisena’s Sri Lankan Freedom Party (SLFP), quit the national unity government. The move, which caught the nation by surprise, was a dramatic reversal of fortunes for Opposition leader and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who has been appointed the new Prime Minister.  since losing both the Presidential election in January 2015, and the Parliament poll in August the same year. Once a staunch Rajapaksa ally in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and a senior cabinet minister when he was President between 2005 and 2015,  , running against him as the joint Opposition candidate with the backing of Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP), to score a victory. Sirisena’s win was hailed as a triumph for people power in Sri Lanka after all its reversals. Democracy and civil liberties suffered during the decade-long rule of an increasingly  , who styled himself the saviour of the nation by ending the island nation's 26-year-long civil war in 2009. With the latest political crisis, the country may well be re-entering the era of a deeply fractured polity, a climate that bred authoritarianism and all the attendant ills of the past. The removal of Wickremesinghe ends not only the national unity government formed after the 2015 parliamentary election by the UNP and SLFP — but also a chapter of democracy in Sri Lanka’s post-civil war politics. The immediate risks of political instability were heightened by the constitutional crisis as the UNP has termed Sirisena’s move a coup. Moreover, Wickramasinghe has refused to step down, saying he remained leader until removed by Parliament, not by the President, where the UNP could muster a majority in the 225-member House. The 19  Amendment to the Constitution, passed in 2015, had ended executive presidency — the dispute has to be settled within Parliament, which was due to meet on November 5 when the 2019 national budget was scheduled to be unveiled. However, President Sirisena has prorogued the session until November 16, giving him time to engineer a majority. Relations between the two leaders had soured particularly after the coalition’s defeat in the provincial elections in February this year. The differences were out in the open in April when  . But it seems that the rift between them was apparently widened by Rajapaksa, whose Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Party (LPPP) made gains in the provincial polls. Sirisena and Wickremesinghe differed over several vital issues — but apparently, the issue of balancing relations with India and China was a tipping point, the same issue also unsettling politics in India’s neighbourhood, within, for instance, the Maldives. Behind the scenes, there is a tussle going on between Chinese and Indian companies to obtain infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka — and reports suggest the Sri Lankan President was not pleased with Wickremesinghe when he pledged to speed up Indian projects on a visit to Delhi on October 21. Observers believe that it was at the former President’s behest that  . Wickremesinghe had reportedly questioned Sirisena about this in last week's cabinet meeting. Rajapaksa was the leader of the country when Sri Lanka became the first nation to fall victim to the Chinese 'debt trap', laid in the name of infrastructure building, forcing the country to then build a series of white elephants. Last year, the debt trap squeezed the country to the point to give up control to China of its  , a white elephant — but with a strategic location close to the busy Indian Ocean shipping lanes. Sirisena may soon find that he was foolish to ally with Rajapaksa to settle his scores with Wickremesinghe. Given that Rajapaksa is a far more canny and ruthless political operator than Sirisena, it is hard to believe that the former President would be happy to play second fiddle to his former minion for very long. Moreover, it was not long ago that Sirisena betrayed him and then became President. It was the pro-China stance, coupled with a high level of alleged corruption, that put an end to Rajapaksa’s rule in 2015. As he rises again, strains on the nation's foreign policy are in full display. As on Sunday, new twists — and a cycle of violence — made things worse. Just after a few days after his sacking, Ranil Wickremesinghe has been recognised as the country’s Prime Minister by the Sri Lankan Parliament Speaker on Sunday. In a letter to Sirisena,  and said it will have “serious and undesirable” consequences on the country, PTI reported. Meanwhile, Preident Maithripala Sirisena maintained his stance and said that Wickremesinghe was sacked for the alleged involvement of a Cabinet minister in a plot to assassinate him. In a much-publicised address to the nation on TV,   and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, a former Defence Secretary — and brother of ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is obvious that these recent developments in Colombo resulted in a total breakdown in ties between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe. This has reflected also in their growing differences on key economic and security-related policies. Counting the figures, the Rajapaksa and Sirisena combine has only 95 seats and is far short of a simple majority in the 225-member House. On the other side, Wickremesinghe’s UNP still has 106 seats on its own. While his opponents’ efforts are to send him to the sidelines are apparently on, the political fundamentals are not so unkind to Wickremesinghe; they in fact seem to be positively conspiring in his favour to keep him at the centre. Even through a stage-managed show and not through the ballot, Rajapakse’s return to Sri Lankan politics is raising concerns about the country’s potential positioning with its economy, foreign policy and internal security now. It was not long ago when Sri Lanka faced economic sanctions from the West over Rajapakse’s brutal military crackdown on the banned Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and alleged human rights violations — in case he sustains his momentum and gets eventual command now, the situation can turn uglier in the days to come. In its typical style, China is playing safe and giving an impression it has nothing do with the situation in Sri Lanka. So far, India has responded on the Colombo episode with ‘silence’ and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who reputedly handles all important foreign policy issues himself, is away in Japan. Hardly surprising that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is not in a position to hand-hold Modi’s pet-slogan, ‘ . Noticeably, be it Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives or Pakistan, Modi’s campaign of 'Neighbourhood First' has not fared too well anywhere. Now, as Sri Lanka hurtles towards choas, India needs to stand by its neigbour — before it gets too late. India has to be much more aware in dealing with the new Sri Lankan leadership that seems to be awed by Chinese largesse.

119,Sharat Pradhan,"Come election season, the Ayodhya temple will return to the Bhartiya Janata Party's (BJP) agenda with a bang. Precisely that appears to be the reason behind the sudden echoing  from different saffron quarters for the construction of the much-debated Ram temple at the disputed Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya. Even as the main BJP leadership discreetly remains silent on the issue, the demand is raised in a clearly orchestrated manner by different frontal organisations and close allies of the party. The first bugle was sounded last week by none other than Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, who openly sought enactment of a legislation to start construction of the temple. While some far-right elements in the party, like Union minister Giriraj Singh, keep taking Ayodhya on a high pitch every now and then, this time, the lead was taken by others. Once a vociferous “international” president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and now self-appointed chief of Antar-Rashtriya Hindu Parishad, Pravin Tagadia went to the extent of staging high drama on the streets of the ancient temple town of Ayodhya. Even though he failed to pull any crowd, the sensation he created by his call for a march to the disputed Ayodhya site where a makeshift Ram temple stands was enough to put him back on the centrestage of temple politics. Since Togadia has been at loggerheads with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for quite some time, it was natural for him to run down the Union government for dilly-dallying with the temple issue.   Perhaps that is what prompted BJP president Amit Shah to  , barely 48 hours later. While Shah maintained that he was there only to address a BJP-RSS coordination committee meeting and the rumour mills were busy churning out stories about him taking the final call on a probable expansion of the Yogi Adityanath cabinet, informed sources claimed the focus of the meeting remained primarily on the Ram temple. Worry was also expressed over Togadia’s attempt to steal the Ayodhya thunder. Knowing the ground reality, that no legislation on the temple would be possible as the BJP still does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, Shah and the UP RSS bigwigs sought to thrash out ways and means to keep the issue alive and burning until the next Lok Sabha election. And that is precisely what the entire saffron brigade seems to be already doing. Party MP Subramaniam Swamy has always been extremely vocal on the issue, but more recently Amit Shah appears to be taking Ayodhya to a higher pitch while many other senior BJP leaders have begun to repeatedly echo their strong sentiment for the temple. That includes even those holding constitutional positions like UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is expected to refrain from meddling with issues that were sub-judice before the highest court of the land. What is strange is that such an obviously pre-meditated campaign is being undertaken at a juncture when the Supreme Court is going to be taking up the long-pending legal battle presumably on a day-to-day basis. That surely arouses suspicion about some possible design to take the tempo to such a high pitch as to attempt to even influence the final verdict. In any case, one never hears a BJP spokesperson talking in terms of losing the court battle. Each one of them makes it a point to loudly proclaim that they would abide by the court verdict — but what they also choose to add confidently is that the verdict would come in favour of Hindus anyway. Evidently, it is their wishful thinking that they wish to impose on all and sundry. That is where the difference lies between the two warring sides. No BJP leader is ready to say what the party would do if the Supreme Court verdict goes against the Hindu claim. On the other hand, Muslims do not hesitate to reiterate that they would abide by the court verdict – whether it is in their favour or against them. Contrary to popular belief that the BJP leadership was playing the Ayodhya temple card to influence the 2019 general election, it appears that the idea behind the move is to reap a harvest in the crucial poll-bound states too. Of the five states that are going to polls over the next two months, the temple card could impact the minds of voters, particularly in Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. However, there was no way that the apex court’s decision could come that soon. Perhaps that is why the BJP leadership and their allies are out to build a tempo over the temple, essentially to put up a façade that the long wait for a grand Ayodhya temple was over and the ruling BJP would soon pave way for its construction. The BJP has surely succeeded to the extent that a loud narrative has been built around the temple, so much so that no opposition party, including the Congress, is ready to even utter a word against the temple. However, it remains to be seen if the hype created by the BJP will eventually get the party its desired dividends.",2018-10-29,"Ram mandir,2019 Lok Sabha polls,Congress,BJP",Why Ayodhya is high up on the BJP's political agenda once again,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/ayodhya-bjp-ram-mandir-congress-2019-lok-sabha-polls/story/1/27484.html

121,Anand Kumar Patel,"After dumping his ""Mahagathbandhan"" with Lalu Yadav’s Rashtriya Janta Dal to ally with Bhartiya Janta Party in an overnight swift manoeuvre last year, ""Maverick"" Nitish Kumar has pulled off another surprise. Ending months of speculation, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners in Bihar, Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) and Janta Dal United (JDU) finally announced to continue their marriage in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Everyone knows that BJP National President Amit Shah is a tough nut to crack when it comes to seat sharing with allies. But it seems that the newfound ""bonhomie"" between the Bihar chief minister and Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped him get better of Shah and he agreed to the formula suggested by JDU that both parties contest on an equal number of seats. A man of few words, Nitish Kumar had been saying for months that he expects a ""respectable"" number of seats from the BJP and that JDU should be treated as the ""big brother"" in Bihar. This was based on the premise that in 2009 polls when JDU contested as part of NDA, it got the lions share of 25 seats while BJP contested on the rest of the 15 seats. This led to a tiff between the two alliance partners to the extent that their ""marriage of convenience"" came under a cloud. Following back to back crushing defeats in Uttar Pradesh by polls – more particularly after Kairana loss – the NDA partners had made their grievances public and pointed fingers at the ""Modi-Shah"" BJP for treating them in ""big brotherly"" way. As part of the alliance outreach, Amit Shah flew to Mumbai to placate jilted Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and later met Badals of the Shiromani Akali Dal. But he skipped the NDA dinner in Patna. While deputy chief minister, Sushil Modi tried to firefight, JDU was certainly not amused. It took a lot of behind the curtain meetings between the two parties before Shah finally flew down to Patna and met Nitish Kumar. The sweetened relationship resulted in JDU MP Harivansh Narayan Singh becoming deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha and JDU softening its stand on ""Special Status"" for Bihar. Since then, both Nitish and Shah met regularly trying to iron out the differences. While announcing the decision to contest on an equal number of seats, Shah made it clear that BJP was sacrificing its sitting MPs to accommodate the all-important ally. BJP has 22 MPs in Lok Sabha and it may have to part with at least five to six seats for allies. So what led to this big change of heart? Is the ""mighty"" BJP in a compromise mode? Well, the BJP top leadership seems to have realised that 2019 will not be the same as 2014. The Modi wave in 2014 which helped NDA sweep 32 out of 40 seats has lost intensity. Also, after the exit of ally Chandrababu Naidu from NDA and the alliance with PDP falling apart in J&K, BJP certainly cannot afford to lose another major ally that too in the Hindi belt. UP and Bihar together constitute 120 seats in Lok Sabha and with SP-BSP alliance emerging, fight for 2019 has become tougher for Modi-Shah duo. Losing an important ally like JDU at the cost of a few seats in Bihar was certainly not game. Also, BJP finds JDU’s OBC and MBC vote bank can be an asset worth investing in and could help it on some seats in East UP as well. Last but not the least, Nitish Kumar-Narendra Modi relations have come a long way since the former broke off from NDA following the latter’s elevation as PM candidate in 2013. In Nitish, Prime Minister Modi has found a bankable ally with mass appeal in the Hindi belt. Both leaders met and discussed the seat-sharing formula for over an hour on Friday which resulted in a final announcement later in the evening. This is enough indication of a blooming understanding of realpolitik between the two leaders. ",2018-10-27,"2019 Lok Sabha polls,BJP,JD(U),Bihar",Seat-sharing with BJP: How Nitish Kumar pulled off another surprise in Bihar,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/nitish-kumar-narendra-modi-bihar-jdu-bjp-2019-lok-sabha-polls/story/1/27455.html
122,Lokpria Vasudevan,"On February 16, 2017, when Edappadi K Palaniswami took oath as the 29th chief minister of Tamil Nadu, many were surprised. Despite being in the top five of the state cabinet, Palaniswami always maintained a low profile. Though he had a dramatic rise in the ranks of AIADMK he was not a popular leader like his bête noire O Paneerselvam. As he took over the reins of the ruling party there were many bets placed on how long EPS (as he is popularly known) would survive the rough and tumble of the seat of power at Fort St George. In the past one and half years the government has been hit by a trust vote, scams, infighting, electoral defeat and investigation by the CBI at the chief minister’s doorstep. Through it all, EPS steered the AIADMK to keep it afloat. The Madras High court order upholding the disqualification of 18 legislators comes as a shot in the arm for EPS, who has now cemented his position as one of the strongest leaders in the AIADMK. Though critics might view this as a temporary breather, the verdict is a morale boost for the rank and file of the party. EPS will ride on the momentum to assert his control over the government and the party. With 20 seats vacant the strength of the Tamil Nadu assembly is reduced from 234 to 214. The AIADMK with 115 legislators is well above the half way mark of 107. The verdict will further bolster the position of the ruling party if they have to negotiate with the BJP for an alliance in the near future. However, the prospect of facing by-polls to the 20 seats will be a nightmare for the AIADMK. The RK Nagar by-poll exposed the AIADMK’s inability to put up an electoral fight. In a post-Jayalalithaa scenario, the mandate for the party has vastly changed.  Walking on a wafer thin majority, the Madras High court judgment saved the EPS government from an immediate crisis. Though EPS puts on a brave face, the by elections will be an acid test for the party. The beleaguered AIADMK will have to fight it out with a resurgent DMK and rebel TTV Dhinakaran waiting to pounce back with a vengeance. Not to forget the new entrants from tinsel town – Rajnikanth and Kamalhassan who are yet to formally announce their decision on contesting in the by-polls. Going by past experiences, the ruling party has had an advantage in bypolls. With entire state machinery at their disposal critics do not rule out a repeat of the infamous election formula in Thirumangalam and Pennagaram by-polls. The verdict gives time for EPS to regroup and strategise to keep the party in power till its original tenure of 2021. Though it may be a daunting task political pundits opine the by-elections in Tamil Nadu will be a referendum on the political climate that prevails in the state. “The respite from the Madras High Court may be short lived for EPS.  They cannot write off TTV Dhinakaran who is emerging popular than the present dispensation in the eyes of the public. Till the party tastes electoral victory, EPS and senior leaders of the party will be untested political entities” quips Narayan Lakshman, associate editor of  . In the wake of the verdict, the biggest challenge for TTV Dhinakaran would be to hold on to the 18 legislators and the support of the 4 rebel MLA’s who owed their allegiance to him. Out of power for 14 months will the MLAs chose to be on the losing side is a possibility many do not rule out. The threat of EPS poaching the MLAs by offering them plum posts in the party will worry Dhinakaran. A shrewd politician, TTV Dhinakaran was smiling to the cameras and called the verdict as an experience in politics. The rebel AIADMK leader finds him in the back foot as he fights to wrest control of the party from the present leadership. While Dhinakaran preferred to go in for by-elections, the disqualified MLAs have decided to appeal against the verdict in the apex court. Subsequently, they will also contest the by-elections whenever they are held.   Senior journalist, R Subramanian, has said that it would have been politically prudent for Dhinakaran to face polls than go in for an appeal. “The verdict is indeed a setback for Dhinakaran but in the longer run it will help him. During campaign for RK Nagar he changed the tide in his favor with his political acumen. He is reaching out to the public on a regular basis with his meetings and road shows. There is a support base but whether that will turn into votes remain to be seen. But it’s a risk he should take if he is willing to topple the government”, he said.",2018-10-27,"By-poll,Tamil Nadu,AIADMK,EPS",Why Madras High Court verdict on disqualification of 18 MLAs is a shot in the arm for AIADMK,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/madras-high-court-eps-aiadmk-tamil-nadu-by-polls/story/1/27459.html

His immediate task is to break the deadlock in the   over seat-sharing, which until now is handled by his party’s Telangana unit. He is making a strong pitch to sustain the Telangana   and replicate it as a model during the 2019 polls. He insists that the coming together of the parties is a necessity both at the state and national levels. Naidu has had a bitter falling out with the NDA on the issue of the central government failing to grant Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh. What has made it worse is the timing of the investigations launched by enforcement agencies on entities associated with TDP leaders, notably party MPs YS Choudhary and CM Ramesh and the municipal administration minister Narayana, who have deep pockets to fund the TDP, too. This is perceived by the TDP chief as political vendetta. Political compulsions underlie Naidu’s defiant stand, as no party in Andhra Pradesh is ready to be seen supping with the BJP in the present circumstances. Moreover, the rival YSR Congress, led by YS Jaganmohan Reddy, is emphasising that the TDP and BJP were in cahoots for four years in order to consolidate anti-incumbency that may hit Naidu’s party hard when the polls to the 175 seat Andhra Pradesh legislative Assembly are held alongside to that for the Lok Sabha next year. This is why Telangana is a poll laboratory for Naidu’s 2019 mission. If he can help ensure the   gets its act together seamlessly, the TDP along with Congress and other like-minded political parties can try and form a mahagathbandhan at the national level to take on the NDA. His seriousness is evident from the fact that he has told senior Telangana TDP leaders not to go in for a confrontation with the Congress through stiff seat-bargaining with less winning prospects. Further, he has asked them to be aggressive in taking failures of the TRS government in Telangana and the NDA government in Delhi, to the people. An alliance with the Congress could also provide Naidu enough cushion to beat anti-incumbency and blunt the YSR Congress challenge. By taking the lead in bringing together several regional parties across the country, including a few who are not comfortable about Congress leadership, unsure about Congress leadership, Naidu may well be the face, infusing a new unity among opposition parties.

124,Sushant Sareen,"Pakistan’s (s) elected Prime Minister Imran Khan should thank the murdered Saudi columnist  for the success of his begging bowl diplomacy to Saudi Arabia. According to reports, the Saudis have agreed to  in the State Bank of Pakistan to window-dress the balance sheet of the government of Pakistan.  This money cannot, however, be used to either buy anything or service Pakistan's external debt. Alongside, the Saudis  an additional $3 billion annually in deferred oil payments for the next three years. Both these measures will give a modicum of relief to Pakistan's bankrupt economy — but will neither be a panacea for the deep structural problems that bring Pakistan to the brink of economic collapse every few years, nor will they be enough for Pakistan to avoid the bitter medicine that will be administered by the IMF. Most of all, it will do nothing to bring Pakistan out of the 'Sheikh Chilli' economics — the Pakistani variant of voodoo economics — that has reduced economic policy-making into a bit of a farce. In a country where chartered accountants (adept at dressing up company balance sheets) and business executives (many of whom have a very poor record of handling their own companies) are considered to be economists, economic mismanagement is no surprise. Adding to the mess is not just the overbearing interference by utterly clueless military men, but also completely ignorant politicians who are high on rhetoric and low on facts and knowledge. The result is that economic policy is pretty much made of Sheikh Chilli-like wet dreams. Figures are first plucked up from somewhere and then, like the proverbial Sheikh Chilli, the economic managers start imagining how, if these figures were to be factored into the economy, things would turn around. For example, a top bureaucrat floated a ridiculous figure of $200 billion in Swiss banks. This was then bandied about by the Chartered Accountant finance minister in Parliament. The opposition latched on to this fictitious number and built an entire political campaign around it. The Prime Minister of Naya Pakistan, who has a proclivity to take every nonsense whispered into his ear as gospel truth,  that once in power, he will bring back this money and make Pakistan the land of milk and honey. The only problem was that there was never any $200 billion. Similarly, ‘economists’ who specialise more in the voodoo part of the ‘dismal science’ are now claiming that they will address the Balance of Payments crisis by cracking down on the $10 billion annual money laundering that takes place from Pakistan. This, it is being said, will solve the financial bind in which Pakistan finds itself. Ask any question on economics, and the government’s spokesman — who claims to be an economist — will only talk about corruption, malfeasance and misfeasance of the previous rulers. As for future plans of the government to get out of the mess that Pakistan finds itself in, it’s back to the Sheikh Chilli school of economics. A prime example of this is the grand housing plan of Imran Khan and his cronies, which is being sold as the project that will kick-start the economy. But till now, none of the czars of the Sheikh Chilli model of economics have explained the voodoo math behind this project. Pakistan is, in many ways, emblematic of a political economy in which policy is based on alternate facts and both the polity and the society live in alternate reality. The only problem is that the rest of the world lives on facts and hard numbers. More importantly, the rest of the world is seeking answers from Pakistan’s regime, but is only getting allegations of wrongdoing by previous regimes. Worse, the Imran Khan government has made an already difficult situation even more difficult with its inexperience, indecision and constant U-turns on policy issues. And, of course, there is also the spectacle of contradictory signals, which has deepened the uncertainty about the economy and spooked investors, including the Chinese. The fundamental problem of Pakistan is that it thinks — nay believes and is convinced — that the rest of the world owes it a living; that it can go on living on other people’s money; that it can merrily treat debt as disposable income and when payback time comes, borrow some more; that it can endlessly cash its nuclear arsenal by convincing the world that it is too dangerous a country to fail; that it can upend the laws of economics on the basis of nothing more than economic wet dreams. The Pakistanis only really care about the money and freebies flowing in — the payback is always someone else’s problem. In a sense, Pakistan’s economy resembles a pyramid scheme in which the investor loses. For instance, there are serious voices being heard in Pakistan that if the Chinese want a return on their investments/loans, they need to invest/loan more money to Pakistan. And if China is not ready to revise the terms of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), it must be prepared to wait for decades for returns. While the civilians play ‘bad cop’ with the Chinese, the military plays ‘good cop’, with the  to convince the Chinese to cut some slack for their ‘iron brother’ and all-weather friend.  It is entirely possible that the Chinese, Saudis and some other countries and institutions might bail Pakistan out once again — but this will once again provide only temporary relief, because it won’t address the deeper structural problems in the Pakistani economy. The structural problems can be summed up as Pakistan living beyond its means. This is reflected in the three deficits, all of which are inter-related: current account, fiscal and saving-investment. While Pakistan is not the only country in the world to have these three deficits, it is probably the only country which has gone through multiple IMF programs without meaningfully fixing this problem. The trouble is that going through the IMF programs without fixing the problem makes the problem worse next time. And this is precisely what is happening currently. What Pakistan has been doing since the late 1990s is that it goes into a IMF program, implements some conditionalities half-heartedly, gets the relief for a few years, then once again goes into a tailspin. In 1999, when Pervez Musharraf ousted Nawaz Sharif, the  . 9/11 saved Musharraf by opening the floodgates of Western aid. The economy boomed — but it was all artificial and debt-funded growth. By 2007, the oil shock, and later, the global financial crisis, proved devastating. The PPP government went to the IMF in 2008 but by 2011, it  of the IMF program. The economy limped until 2013, when Nawaz Sharif once again approached the IMF. The three-year program ended in 2016 — the first time Pakistan successfully completed an IMF program. But soon, political turmoil and economic drift set in, and the economy tanked. Now, in 2018, Pakistan is once again broke — its energy economics is  ; its debt has been doubling every five years; its budget numbers are completely untenable, with defence and debt servicing consuming almost the entire tax revenue and all other expenses being managed from debt; its external account is unmanageable.  Pakistan has no choice but to go to IMF once again. The problem in going to the IMF is, however, partly political and partly economic. The IMF conditionalities will, among other things, involve devaluation in the rupee, rise in interest rates, rationalising energy and other prices, cutting subsidies and privatising loss-making state owned enterprises. All this will cause immense economic distress — the cost of living will go up, growth will fall, employment opportunities will be severely curtailed, government subsidies and development expenditure will fall drastically, rising interest rates will lead to a rise in debt servicing as will the depreciation in currency — and will, in turn, have a major political fallout on the ruling dispensation. But the choice is between not going to IMF and risking the economy’s collapse — or going to the IMF and inflicting great pain on the people. Although Imran Khan and his cronies are promising that this will be the last time Pakistan will go to IMF, such promises have been made in the past too. One reason why this promise cannot be taken seriously is because Imran Khan and his lieutenants are being economical with the truth. Instead of telling the people of Pakistan the full magnitude of the problem, they are busy selling dreams: only the next six-odd months are going to be difficult, after which all problems will be over and the economy will be up and running. Anyone with a modicum of knowledge of economics knows this isn’t true. Structural adjustment is a long and difficult process. But given Imran Khan’s proclivity for selling pleasant lies to the people of Pakistan — he promised to end corruption in 90 days; he declared he would commit suicide rather than go with a begging bowl around the world — and his reliance on cosmetic measures — selling buffaloes to give an impression of austerity — he thinks he will be able to fool them again. Even now, there are some signs that the government of ‘naya Pakistan’ is hoping it will get enough from China and Saudi to not have to go for an IMF program. But, if forced, Pakistan will go to the IMF and gamble on getting out of the program much earlier than the duration of the program. The reason is that the pain an IMF program will administer is difficult to bear for long because of the social and political impact it will have. But if once again Pakistan ducks the necessary structural adjustments, then it is quite possible that Imran’s promise of never going to the IMF might just come true — not because Pakistan’s economy will be out of the hole it has dug for itself, but because there might not be much of an economy left to go to the IMF next time.",2018-10-24,"Imf bailout,Saudi Arabia,Imran Khan,Pakistan economy",The 'Sheikh Chilli' economics of Imran Khan,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pakistan-s-economy-imran-khan-saudi-arabia-imf-china/story/1/27407.html
125,Sahil Joshi,"In politics, as they say, nothing happens by accident. If it does, then you must know it has been planned that way.  recently indicated that a national level pre-poll opposition alliance for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was unlikely. “I do not see the possibility of a uniform national alliance since the political situation on the ground varies from state to state,” he said. “We should accept the dominance of .. After polls, the picture of who will lead the alliance will be clear from those who get maximum seats.” In 2004, it took a lot of efforts for the Congress leadership to come to terms to the fact that the party was in no position to defeat the BJP-led NDA. Until then, the Congress was basking in its past glory. Even though the party's position was dwindling in the two important states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, most of its leadership firmly believed that the situation could be salvaged. A reason behind that confidence was the fact that the party had a considerable presence in other states, unlike at present. But Sonia Gandhi, as the party president, and her senior leaders were realistic enough to assess the situation correctly — they knew the importance of strong pre-poll alliances across regions to win the elections. Even though the party knew that   and Mamata Banerjee (TMC) would never agree to be part of one alliance, to the Congress' credit, it did manage to rope in Sharad Pawar (NCP) and Lalu Yadav (RJD) to the fold. The Congress did face initial hiccups because of the soured equations between Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar. (Pawar had quit the Congress after raking up Sonia’s foreign-origin issue. He later formed the NCP.   was part of NCP’s manifesto during the 1999 elections.) Even though the Congress and the NCP together were running governments in Maharashtra and Goa after fighting elections against each other, it was a major shift in Congress’s policy to get into a pre-poll alliance. By then even the NCP had dropped the 'foreign-origin' issue. That was 2004. Things have changed a lot in 2018.   And it's clear that he will never go back to the party. Once earlier, he had spent nearly eight years out of the Congress, but chose to go back to the main fold in 1986, accepting Rajiv Gandhi’s leadership. But that was a time when the Congress was a formidable force. Now, the party doesn't enjoy the same status. Pawar is clear in his mind that the Congress is unlikely to regain its original position — not only in near future but perhaps never. That could be one of the reasons why Pawar has made it clear that there cannot be any nation-wide mahagathabandhan (grand alliance), but alliances in states to challenge the BJP in 2019. Pawar’s admission clearly shows his assessment of the Congress and its fast-diminishing reach. In 2004, it was Pawar, who took the initiative in forging an alliance with the Congress for the Lok Sabha elections. While Pawar was one of the key players of the UPA, the alliance successfully challenged the Atal Bihari Vajapayee-led NDA. Pawar was realistic in accepting that the Congress is the only 'true national’ party which could challenge the BJP at the time. He made it clear that smaller partners should let the Congress lead the alliance. This time around, he has clearly hinted that the  , Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra. But in the rest of the states, it can be part of state-wide alliances. Even in Maharashtra, he has emphasised several times that the NCP got more seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections than that of the Congress. Also, despite contesting separately, the Congress and the NCP won almost equal number of seats in the Assembly followed by Lok Sabha elections. This clearly indicates that even for an alliance in Maharashtra, the Congress will have to cough up more than it wants to reach a seat-sharing arrangement. But there is another major difference between 2004 and 2018 — the Congress’s ability to bring in regional partners under one umbrella. The Congress is still going through a change in leadership at a crucial time. Old guards — like Pranab Mukherjee, known for his trouble shooting skills — are no longer active in cobbling up an alliance. Others who have the capacity — like Pawar, for example — are no longer in the party. In 2004, the Congress still had a strong presence in the states, even if it wasn't doing too well, like Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, or even UP and Bihar. But now, the party has been wiped out of almost every corner due to a lack of strong leadership in the states. Party president Rahul Gandhi’s efforts too aren't very encouraging and seems like he has a long way to go. Pawar’s words clearly hints that the regional satraps are still unwilling to come under the Congress umbrella to take on Modi and the BJP. What's more, in all likelihood, the Congress might have to settle for far lesser seats than what it has been contesting so far. For instance, in UP, if the BSP, SP, Lok Dal and the Congress form an alliance, the grand old party will be forced to contest in far lesser seats than it had in 2004, 2009 or even in 2014. The Congress will also not be able to call the shots in Maharashtra, where the  While Rahul Gandhi is struggling to bring back his party's lost glory, Pawar has made it clear that the Congress must get ready to give more space and prominence to allies than it did in 2004.",2018-10-25,"Rahul Gandhi,Opposition unity,Congress,Sharad Pawar",United Opposition: Why Sharad Pawar wants Congress to focus on state-wide alliances for 2019 Lok Sabha elections,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/united-opposition-why-sharad-pawar-wants-congress-to-focus-on-state-wide-alliances-for-2019-lok-sabha-elections/story/1/27420.html
126,Manjeet Sehgal,"Normally, when we think of a Bishop, an image of a person wearing a cassock and a mitre, holding a staff (crosier) comes to mind. He is usually considered to be a living vessel of grace, through whom the holy spirit flows. But a diocesan bishop in Jalandhar, Punjab, appears today to be no less than a dreaded figure to his adversaries, which includes nuns, their family members and clergymen. Rape-accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal was recently given   by nuns, female followers and clergy members, among others, after he was released on bail. Unlike other rape-accused, he eluded the police reportedly for over three months. He had even told   that he enjoys clout, not only in his own but also in other religious communities, including Sikhs and Hindus, and among politicians too. All that, according to Mulakkal, was due to his involvement with other communities. Eyebrows were raised though when Mulakkal was given a rousing reception with followers showering petals on him. Slogans were shouted and a special prayer organised for his well-being upon his arrival. For some nuns we spoke to, Mulakkal is innocent and has apparently been falsely implicated in the sexual exploitation case. Of course Mulakkal had denied the allegations, but the way in which he apparently managed to avoid police action for over three months and   has induced a sense of fear into everyone, especially his adversaries and the family members of the rape survivor. She had accused him of raping her 13 times in two years, apart from allegedly forcing her into unnatural sex. Sources close to the Jalandhar Diocese allege Mulakkal's allies are now reportedly approaching his adversaries to withdraw their statements. Kerala Police SIT has questioned more than 100 people in connection with the alleged sexual exploitation case. Those who vociferously spoke against Mulakkal also included Father Kuriakose Kattuthara, 62 — who was found dead on the morning of October 22. According to the Kattuthara family, the 62-year-old was allegedly getting calls from people who called themselves Mulakkal's allies to withdraw the five-page statement he gave the Kerala police, accusing the bishop of immorality and exploitation of the poor nuns. Kuriakose's brother, Jose Kattuthara, told the police that he (Kuriakose) had shared his worries over the fact that once Franco got out on bail, his life would likely be in danger. He even feared his phones were being tapped and he was being monitored all along. Kuriakose worked at the Jalandhar Diocese until Franco was arrested, and was then transferred to the Dasuya church, 15 days before he was found dead. Jose is not the only person who is in fear of the former bishop now. The sister of the rape survivor nun also senses threat to her and her family. In a complaint to the Kerala police, she has appealed to the authorities to provide protection to the family's lives and assets. The five nuns who are currently living with the survivor are also very scared, especially after Father Kuriakose was found dead. They believe there is a deeper mystery behind the death of Father Kuriakose who had spoken up against Mulakkal. ""We and those who stood with us are in danger,"" Sister Anupama said, adding she feared that  Jalandhar Diocese spokesperson, Father Peter, termed the allegations as false, adding that Bishop Franco Mulakkal is apparently a law-abiding citizen and had appeared before the SIT as and when required. Those who believe Franco Mulakkal is just a tainted priest now may be shocked to learn that he is in fact an alumnus of St Mary's Petit Seminary, Kerala, holds two Masters degrees in English and Sociology from Gurunanak Dev University, Amritsar, and a doctorate in moral theology from the Alphonsian Academy of Lateran University, Rome. He was ordained priest for the Diocese of Jalandhar in April 1990. Yet, his image has metamorphosed rapidly for some, from a respected man of God and letters, to a figure currently resembling a deeply feared being.",2018-10-24,"Kerala nun rape,Kuriakose kattuthara,Jalandhar bishop,Franco mulakkal",#NunRapeCase: How the accused's image has changed from respected priest to a dreaded figure,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/franco-mulakkal-kuriakose-kattuthara-jalandhar-bishop-sister-anupama/story/1/27397.html
127,Vikram Sood,"He had joined the   in the 1970s, about the same time as had Osama bin Laden, when the Brotherhood was still an underground movement in Saudi Arabia. He later confided to a friend that they were hoping to establish an Islamic state all over the globe. He was close enough to Osama to know that he always carried a bag of salt with him and he would suck at the salt whenever he felt dizzy to prevent his blood pressure from sinking. The same person, working as a journalist, had   in Afghanistan earlier, had gone to Khartoum in 1994 to persuade Osama to make a public statement renouncing violence. While Osama was willing to condemn violence inside the Kingdom, he refused to say this on record. He was a source of John Brennan, CIA representative in Saudi Arabia, who later became Barrack Obama's CIA Director. He was a US Green Card-holder. It is also said of him that he was a nephew of Adnan Khashoggi, the billionaire arms dealer and a champion wheeler-dealer wherever money was to be made. Adnan was a guarantor in the notorious Iran-Contra scam during the Reagan era. Yes, Jamal Khashoggi was no ordinary person. Khashoggi fled the Kingdom in September 2017 fearing reprisals after his differences with Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) grew. He soon began working as a correspondent with  . Later, he told   columnist, Dexter Filkins, that Mohammed bin Salman was not really arresting hardline clerics, but the reformers because they were popular and this worried MBS. This was part of a wide sweep against all potential enemies of MBS. Khashoggi's disappearance from the Saudi Consulate that fateful October 2 morning is surely the result of a botched-up intelligence operation. The Saudis were trying to organise an 'extra-ordinary rendition' — but without the clinical finesse of the Americans and without local support. The Turks say the Saudis killed Khashoggi. Meanwhile, the Trump administration had a three-point agenda for West Asia, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, with no political and diplomatic experience of the region was leading the charge. The agenda was to totally defeat the Islamic Caliphate of ISIS, force the Gulf States to stop funding radical Islam and perhaps, the more important, push back Iran into nothingness. What followed for both the US and the Saudis were pursuits of policies removed from reality — something at which both have excelled in other areas. As MBS consolidated power, which included his high-profile purge of the Saudi Royals and wealthy Saudis allegedly for corruption, he also tripled the funds allocated for lobbying in the US in 2017 to US $27 million. Money reportedly poured into organisations like the Middle East Institute, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies and the Brookings Institute. Well-known lobbying firms like the McKeon Group and BGR Group with connections to the House Armed Services Forces, founded by some prominent Republicans and the Glover Park Group as well as by Democrat political strategists, were favored. The UAE also began to pitch in with its own lobbying effort. The US Congress had voted out a resolution aimed at extracting the US from 'the worst humanitarian crisis in the world' — the endless killings in Yemen, where the Shia Houthis refused to stop fighting Saudi-backed forces since 2015. The massive lobbying had apparently worked — and MBS's visit to the US in March 2018 was a success. Quite apparently, the US was not going to let down its great friend in the region. Besides, it was also a question of money — and billions of it. The US has promised US $139 billion worth of military contracts to the Saudis while the Saudis promised to buy US $110 billion worth of military hardware that would benefit companies like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The EU too has substantial investment commitments in Saudi Arabia, with France being one of the leading European investors. Besides, MBS was seen as the agent of change in his country with his Vision 2030. Oil and money have been strategic and lucrative reasons to diligently woo the Saudi royals, ever since   aboard the USS Quincy in 1945. The King promised access to oil and the President promised US security. Modern-day strategic goals include regime change in Iran as an increasingly urgent motive in wooing Saudi Arabia — even though this has not succeeded since 1979. Initially, President Trump tried to defend the Saudis — but this became untenable. Brennan has been particularly scathing in his criticism of the US President for his attempts to describe Khashoggi's disappearance as an act by rogue killers. He described the killing as an atrocity, adding that Crown Prince Muhammed bin Sultan's close ties with the White House ""must not stand in the way of a full and forceful US response."" The former British SIS chief Sir John Sawyers has been quoted as having said that the theory that rogue Saudi military officers were responsible for this was not acceptable and this would further undermine respect for America ""when it panders to such blatant fiction"". 'Rogue agents' do not really exist; they are only described so when a deniable covert operation goes wrong — but no-one believes such fiction, like 'non-state actors' to describe state-supported terrorists. US intelligence agencies have long been suspicious of the close Kushner-MBS relationship and about actions in West Asia. The Israelis would be concerned that this episode could diminish the Saudi image in Washington DC. The murder of one dissident journalist is unlikely to upset larger interests because of perceived larger strategic interests, Iran, for instance, at stake. Sanctions against MBS for this one act are probably unthinkable when the entire Saudi campaign against Yemen has Congressional approval. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was sent to meet MBS while the Director of the CIA flew in to Turkey to talk to an angry President Erdogan because ultimately, the issue is Iran in West Asia — and not Jamal Khashoggi.",2018-10-24,"Donald Trump,Mohammed bin salman,Saudi Arabia,Jamal khashoggi",Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered.

128,C Uday Bhaskar,"The killing of the Saudi Arabian dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, on the premises of the Saudi consulate, has been  by US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Oct 23) as the “worst in the history of cover-ups, a total fiasco.” He added: ""They had a very bad original concept. It was carried out poorly... Bad deal, should have never been thought of. Somebody really messed up.” This public statement ends the ambiguity that characterised the US position on the Khashoggi affair, wherein the dissident journalist of Saudi origin — but a US citizen and a   columnist — had ""disappeared"" after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.  Turkish officials claimed that the journalist had been tortured and killed within the consulate. However, Washington chose to remain ambivalent, given the Trump affinity for the Saudi monarchy and for reasons that span from US geopolitical and commercial interests to the Beltway's personal ties with the royal family. This public castigation by the US President was driven by growing anger and dismay within the US about the killing and the clumsy denials by the Saudi regime. The US censure comes in the wake of the  made by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday that Khashoggi was targeted in a meticulously planned operation. It has increased the diplomatic heat on Riyadh by publicly demanding that the 18 suspects detained by Saudi Arabia be extradited to Istanbul to face trial. Apart from the Saudi-Turkey rivalry, the Khashoggi killing raises a number of complex and disturbing issues. While dissidents the world over have been ruthlessly targeted by authoritarian regimes (recall the manner in which Russian dissidents have mysteriously disappeared or died in the UK, or the Chinese detention of their dissidents including Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo), the Istanbul killing stands out for its sheer audacity and vileness. Turkish media  reveal that the team from Saudi Arabia which ""supervised"" the killing had among them a specialist equipped with a bone-saw to dismember the body of the slain journalist. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the body parts have been buried or hidden within the residence of the consulate staff and more gory details of this killing are likely to be revealed soon. The Turkish President has drawn attention to the gross violation of the principle of diplomatic immunity and has argued that while the Saudi consulate does enjoy such privileges, the fact that such a murder of a US Green Card-holder took place on Turkish soil warrants Ankara’s intervention. How a Saudi-Turkey-USA modus vivendi is arrived at amidst the current blood and body-splattered imbroglio will shape the principles underpinning diplomatic immunity internationally in the years ahead. More than the limited sector of diplomatic principles and protocols is the rather complex domain that governs the conduct of international relations and the engagement between nations. State power has an inherent oppressive element embedded in it and democracies are no exception to this thumb rule. How political dissidence is dealt with varies with national culture, countries and the leader in question. In the Khashoggi case, the journalist, who once had very close ties with the Saudi royal family, had become critical of the young crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) — he paid with his life. Will moral principles and ethical values shape the global response to this killing of a journalist? President Erdogan declared, “Covering up a savage murder like this will only hurt the human conscience. We expect the same sensitivity from all parties, primarily the Saudi Arabian leadership.” Cynics can draw attention to the manner in which Erdogan himself and Turkey, in general, have dealt with their own political dissidents, but the Khashoggi case has turned the global spotlight on the Saudi profile in an embarrassing manner. Long accused of supporting radical Islamic ideologies and terror groups (recall the identity of the perpetrators in the 9/11  Twin Tower attack), Saudi Arabia has a dismal human rights record when it comes to journalists and political dissidents. Yet, given its hydro-carbon primacy in the world and individual geopolitical compulsions, most nations defer to Riyadh and prefer to turn a Nelson’s eye to many of its transgressions. The Khashoggi affair appears to be the tipping point to this pattern — even a very empathetic USA (that has long lived with the contradiction of the world’s oldest democracy supporting a regime that, till recently, forbade women from driving a car) is now talking about a firm response. US Vice President Mike Pence claimed that the American decision will be one that “reflects the values and national security interests of the nation and will also make sure the world knows the truth.” However outraged global opinion is currently over the Khashoggi death, it is more likely that normative principles and values will be ""trumped"" by the complex geopolitical and energy considerations that Saudi Arabia represents. It is pertinent to note that India, China and Russia have been muted in their public statements about this sordid issue – there is a sub-text here which is a disquieting reality check about the unalloyed realpolitik contours of international relations.",2018-10-24,"US,Donald Trump,Saudi Arabia,Turkey",A tipping point: The Khashoggi killing is the blurring of global moral values and principles,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/khashoggi-turkey-saudi-arabia-donald-trump-us/story/1/27395.html

The event was organised to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the proclamation of the Azad Hind government in Singapore by Subhas Chandra Bose. The political significance of the event was not lost on anyone. 
 
 October 21 is also celebrated as the National Police Commemoration Day. Before the Red Fort ceremony, the Prime Minister  . Like the yet to be completed National War Memorial, the Police Memorial was long-awaited.

It is a much-deserved tribute to the police and paramilitary force whose contributions and sacrifices often go unseen and unsung. At the Police Day ceremony, the Prime Minister also declared the institution of   for the National Disaster Response Force personnel. The role of the NDRF at times of natural calamities and man-made emergencies is rarely recognised. So, a laudable move indeed. No doubt, there was a political agenda underlying both the functions. PM Modi did not miss the opportunity to score his points. At the Police Memorial inauguration, he asked, “Why did it take 70 years after independence for the memorial to come up?” PM Modi was more direct in his Red Fort speech. He said that the contribution of leaders such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, BR Ambedkar and Sardar Patel   in mainstream Indian discourse to ""magnify the presence of one family"". On earlier occasions, he had declared, BJP would honour great personalities neglected by the Congress, who played a role in the independence struggle and nation building. The reactions were on expected lines. There were loud cheers from BJP supporters across the country. The Congress came down heavily on Narendra Modi and the BJP. It accused them of trying to appropriate national icons like Subhas Bose, Sardar Patel and Ambedkar. It is not a mere coincidence that Patel’s statue of unity, Ambedkar Memorial, Police Memorial and now recognition to Bose from Red Fort is coming from a BJP government, all in the same tenure. But in being over-defensive about it, the Congress is scoring self goals. First, if the Congress had not left gaps wide open in public memory for these giants of the freedom struggle, there was no way for the BJP to sneak into that space. The fact that it has to contest BJP’s claims itself concedes the point. Second, no one can have proprietary rights over national heroes. It is pointless to argue about the role of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in the freedom movement. As Indians, they are as entitled to stake claims to the legacy of these greats as Congress or anyone else for that matter. Congress is being naive in disparaging the efforts. For example, they mocked the Statue of Unity  . In doing so, far from undermining the BJP, they are in fact further slighting these personalities. That reinforces the impression of the Congress being averse to any non-Nehru-Gandhi dynasty members gaining prominence. Finally, the Congress itself can be accused of convenient “appropriation”. The present Congress is in no way the natural successor of the Indian National Congress formed in 1885. It was a breakaway group created by Indira Gandhi. It is another matter that the original Congress was decimated over time. But, that does not make the new INC its only legitimate inheritor. Some very disingenuous arguments are being put forth on why the BJP cannot seek association with the likes of Bose. For example, it was said that the   such as Bhulabhai Desai to defend the INA undertrials. Ironically, the other day, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi’s lawyers in a Delhi court objected to being called  . They said they are not Congress lawyers but professionals. The daughter of INA’s legendary Captain Laxmi Sahgal, the CPI leader Suhasini Ali tweeted:  
 
 One can argue about how she can be so sure that he would have used those words today. But without getting into that may one ask – how was her dear late mother honoured during her lifetime and when she died in 2012? Yes, indeed Subhas-babu used Urdu words for official purposes. But, then his vision was one of united India and I doubt if he would have ever endorsed partition. The idea is not to quibble over details. In any case, the debate is not about how Subhas Bose and his INA comrades were treated before Independence. But, the place Bose, Patel, Ambedkar and others got in India’s history written after 1947. While Congress is being prickly, other Opposition parties have not shown any sensitivity towards these moves by BJP. For example, Mamata Banerjee tweeted on the occasion of the Azad Hind Government formation’s 75th anniversary. 
 
 This is a gracious, albeit tacit, acknowledgement of the fact that there is room for everyone to celebrate Bose’s legacy. There is little point in being possessive or protective about a common turf. Congress still seems to be missing the bigger picture by thinking it is only about Modi and BJP. Life in India has moved beyond the dynasty and cannot also be captured by a single individual or family anymore. What Modi and BJP have succeeded in to a large extent is to open up the closed doors. Social media has ensured that narratives cannot be set unidirectionally. Delhi cannot control the news flow anymore. Sabrimala is causing ripples across the country like never before. Name change of   is not of interest for people of the Hindi heartland alone. The INA raising day celebrations in Delhi is being shared on social media across the world. Historical assumptions can be challenged from all corners. Whether one likes it or not, alternative ecosystems are being created. More importantly, they are here to stay with or without Modi and the BJP. Parties like the BSP have already claimed its own icons. All others have their own idols or models of identity politics. The ideologically agnostic and religion-neutral middle ground is up for grabs. But, no one can have monopoly rights over it. It has to be a shared inheritance. The Congress cannot hope to come back to power on its own in the foreseeable future. If it can form a government through a mahagatbandhan, it will be despite Rahul Gandhi rather than because of him. It is time for the Congress to accept the new reality with grace.

130,Tuhin A Sinha,"Even as I got down to pen this article, came the tragic  in Kulgam. It is not uncanny anymore that every time the narrative seems to be slipping out of the grasp of anti-India elements in the Valley, these desperate acts are triggered as warning. The fact that these desperate acts apparently enjoy the tacit support of both the NC and the PDP makes it diabolic. I am glad that instead of getting deterred by this nefarious game and giving in like the Congress always did, the Modi government has charted out a resolute course. The change, as manifested by the  of the local body elections, is just about beginning to show. There are several facts that corroborate that ground reality is indeed changing fast in Kashmir. An overall voting percentage of 35 per cent is not bad if you take into account the fact that both of Kashmir’s local parties had brazenly toed the separatist line in boycotting the polls. That Baramulla — a border district — had a record   voter turnout should serve as a rude shock for professional naysayers. Now, to quickly gaze through the results: The BJP’s stellar show in the Jammu region is on expected lines. But who would have thought that the BJP would gain a decisive presence in some of the worst strife-torn districts? The party has won 25 seats in Baramulla, 29 in Anantnag and 12 in the terror hotbed of Shopian. It will be governing at least six municipal bodies in the Valley with over 100 wards under its control. It is important to understand the game-changing implications of these results. One, while it is easy to dismiss local body elections as non-political, the fact is that this gives the Central government direct access and reach to the grassroots. The delivery of most government schemes can now be monitored directly by the central government (in the absence of a state government), giving these huge momentum. Two, as I have repeatedly maintained, there is enormous disillusionment in the Valley against both the local parties. The millenial urban voter, unlike the previous generation, sees through the duplicity of both the NC and the PDP, and is not willing to put up with the self-aggrandising politics of the Muftis and Abdullahs. They find both parties grossly incompetent. By toeing the separatist line and staying away from the polls, both these parties have alienated their supporters further. Three, as we can see, a huge proportion of winners in these polls are independent candidates. As far as I know, many of the independent candidates were PDP and NC grassroots workers who did not want their leaders’ selfishness to rob them of career opportunities. Hence, fighting as ""independents"" was a mid-way meeting ground with the BJP’s vision for the state. In due course, the independents are expected to back the BJP on development-related agendas, cementing the party’s hold in the state further. Four, with their parties’ presence at the local level eroded, both the NC and the PDP are going to find their task that much more arduous in the next Assembly elections. Finally, with a strong local presence added to with the expected support of independents and those sections of the PDP and the NC who have long been disillusioned with their party bosses, a foundation has been laid for a BJP-led state government in Kashmir in the years to come. PM Modi is a man of vision and resolve. Way back in 1992 as an RSS  , he was a key member of the then-BJP president Murli Manohar Joshi’s mission to unfurl the tricolour at Lal Chowk. It was in those years that Modi had identified his first set of unlikely lieutenants, starting with a local Muslim policeman, who would work for the BJP in the valley. Surprising as it may sound today, that trusted team stuck with Modi through thick and thin, through the worst phases of militancy, and risking their own lives. New people, new sections got added in the coming years until the game was elevated another level in 2014. And now, 26 years after Joshi unfurled the tricolour at Lal Chowk, the BJP’s strong presence at the local wards across Kashmir is a watershed moment. In recent debates on the future of Article 35A in Kashmir, I have categorically maintained that in principle, we stand opposed to it, but would much rather prefer the democratic and legislative route than the legal route, to revoke it. When I mention the democratic route, I say this with responsibility that the day is not far when the BJP will be heading the state government in Jammu Kashmir. It may take some more time, maybe a few more years, but a clear foundation for it has been laid under PM Modi and Amit Shah. The results of the urban local body elections vouch for that plan and provide a teaser of what lies ahead The conclusive solution to the Kashmir problem remains an unhindered, seamless integration with India, which was held back by vested interests. We stand one step closer to achieving that now.",2018-10-22,"BJP,Local bodies poll,Panchayat Polls,Jammu and Kashmir Polls",Why local body election results in Kashmir are a game changer,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kashmir-local-body-elections-panchayat-polls-bjp-nc-pdp-congress/story/1/27348.html
131,PS Gopikrishnan Unnithan,"On September 28, the Supreme Court allowed the entry of  . The five-judge constitution bench, in its 4:1 verdict, said that banning the entry of women into the shrine is gender discrimination and the practice violates the rights of Hindu women. The verdict has been widely acclaimed for upholding gender equality. As the Left government in Kerala welcomed the verdict, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on multiple occasions reiterated that the state government would take all possible steps to implement the verdict. This was considered a brave stand by the state government, despite immense pressure from religious fundamentalists. But what happened on the ground was completely different. and his police failed miserably to control the crisis in the aftermath of the SC verdict. During the five-day pilgrimage period, at least 15 women between 10 and 50 years had to abandon their journey during various stages of the pilgrimage. The state government and the police made an absolute mockery of their own assurances. On day one, as a  took the trek from Pamba and protesters tried to stop her. She, however, kept walking ahead with police protection. But the damage has already been done by the self-proclaimed custodians of custom who heckled and harassed the woman and her children. After 400 metres of trekking, she was forced to return as her children insisted on going back.  At the same time, Nilakkal, a base camp 25 km from Sabarimala, saw multiple incidents of violence against journalists.   were specifically targeted by the goons who had arrived apparently to “protect the customs and culture” of the Sabarimala temple. Vehicles were vandalised, equipment were damaged, even stolen. The vernacular media too was attacked by the protesters. All this happened while the police looked on helplessly. Nilakkal remained tense for over three hours only because of police apathy. However, it’s not just the police who failed to maintain law and order. The state intelligence too proved a disaster in handling the crisis. The administration was naive enough to believe the protesters who initially claimed they would only carry out peaceful gatherings in Pamba and Nilakkal. By the time the state police deployed additional forces in Nilakkal and Pamba, more than 1,000 protesters had already managed to reach Sabarimala to stop the women from entering. It was only on the second day of pilgrimage that the police showed some intent. Over 200 policemen, led by IG S Sreejith, accompanied a Telugu woman journalist, Kavitha Jakkala, and activist Rehna Fathima. However, the police had to return from Nadapandal (300 metres from Sannidhanam shrine) after protesters gathered in large numbers. Thereafter, the police seemed more like mute spectators in Pamba and Sannidhanam. The incident also became a huge morale booster for the protesters as they started checking women purely based on how old they looked. On October 20,  was stopped and heckled in Sabarimala on the suspicion that she was below 50 years of age. She literally had to beg for the mercy of the protesters to let her inside — the police intervened only after 30 minutes of drama. The state government certainly has a lot of work to do before the pilgrimage season begins in mid-November. By now, the government must have realised that it is easier to commit than keeping its commitment.",2018-10-22,"Pinarayi Vijayan,Supreme Court,Lord ayyappan,Sabarimala protests",Sabarimala: Why Pinarayi Vijayan and Kerala Police failed to keep their promise to women devotees,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pinarayi-vijayan-and-his-police-failed-miserably-in-sabarimala/story/1/27363.html
132,Ifra Jan,"#MeToo is has been called the “Indian Working women's revolution” because it was sudden, it jolted society out of their comfort zones, and found its strength from the working middle class women on social media. Like any revolution, it was not going to be easy to shake the old traditional hierarchies of power and dominance. The “empire” would strike back. Far away from the metropolitan cities of the mainland, a small organisation — the Kashmir Women's Collective — decided to foray into these dangerous waters. The organisation   a list of anonymous accounts of sexual harassment cases accompanied with screenshot of IM conversations as evidence and accounts of victims who suffered sexual violence and intimidation at the hands of journalists, bureaucrats, political workers, all powerful people in their own fields. While they did anticipate backlash, what shocked them more was the political tagging of the group itself. In a state that is paranoid about “mukbirs” or informers of the security forces, their perceived widespread network which “gets common people killed”, everyone is a suspect. So much so that rumours had it that even Burhan Wani was an “ ”, until he died. It is a continuing blanket of fear that has held the Valley in grips ever since militancy broke out in early 1990s. It is also an extremely dangerous label — the accusation of being with the establishment whether true or not puts a mark on your back. Whether that gets you killed is another story. This widespread fear is also used as a disciplining tactic to scuffle dissent. Like “Witch Hunts” in the 1600s in Britain, anyone who disturbs the spectrum of things, of narratives, of those who take too much space, fears the risk of being called “Pro-State Indian Agents” — a dangerous label. Kashmir Women's Collective had not anticipated that it would be called out publicly as a “statist group” which shall, allegedly, be shown “no mercy”. Conflict has a way of keeping everything hostage to itself.  who led the fight for the   case — an eight-year-old girl's heinous hate murder crime — has now been accused of rape. Talib Hussain's victim decided not to seek justice for herself because it would strengthen the Hindu Right's case against Asifa's murderers. She held herself hostage to the Hindu-Muslim tussle which played around Asifa's case, while she kept cutting herself with sharp objects to reduce her pain. Kashmir is another story. Beyond the usual skirmishes around Nowhatta and Maisuma, and young boys who pick up guns, Kashmir essentially is a battle of narratives — of constant reminders of the UN Resolutions, of Kashmiri Pandits, of Gawkadal and Nadimarg, of plebiscites that were never held, of letters which asked the Pandits to flee, of promises which were broken, of refugee camps, it is a constant never ending battle field of stories, a madness which even Saadat Hasan Manto would fail to decipher. In this politically maddening atmosphere, what has irked people is sexual harassment becoming the headline for a day. One day, women spoke beyond the conflict in a parallel space. That day the limelight fell away from conflict to victims of sexual harassment. This did not go well with many people on social media in Kashmir. “What about  ?” “Why are the feminists not condemning his death?” This is in such sharp contrast with mainland India where it would be absurd to ask Priya Ramani — the first woman journalist to publicly accuse former minister MJ Akbar of sexual misconduct — what she thinks of the farmers and the agrarian crisis in India. But in Kashmir, questions that scream “How dare you not talk about the issues we feel are important?” are loud, assertive and clear. Of course Manan Wani's death is a tragedy on so many levels, but what does insurgency have to do with a woman who was forced to leave her job, her only source of income because she could not stand harassment at workplace anymore? Are there no victims in Kashmir beyond the conflict? It is absolutely essential to now carve out a parallel space for issues which are equally important. A famous transgender singer in Kashmir, Reshma's rights matter as much as Insha's, the girl who was blinded by pellets. But in Kashmir the space for a narrative for anything other than conflict has been shrinking, and to now forcefully create one, will take immense courage. Another allegation against KWC is that it has turned justice into a “Khap Panchayat” or even “mob lynching” where no due process is being followed. It is being accused of circumventing the official procedures and bodies like Women's Commision, or police stations and therefore assuming the role of a parallel investigating body. Such claims may appear genuine to a lot of law-abiding citizens but it is extremely ironic to those of us, who have grown up on stories of valour of Sang Baaz, or the stone-pelters who by no stretch of imagination follow the “due process” to vent out their grievances. Children have been blinded, police stations have been burnt, schools closed, policemen injured, yet it was never seen that the community at large asked any of this to be put to an immediate halt because the “institutions have to be respected”. Today, survivors of sexual assault are being reminded of the democratic and institutionalised functioning of justice in India, of police stations, when hundreds of police stations have been torched since 1990s. Who knows the failure of “due process” better than the Kashmiris themselves? What happened to  ? Did those women not file an FIR? What happened to Sarla Bhat? Did any court take up her case? Yet, three decades have passed, but it does not stop us from talking about the horrors these women and countless others went through. So why should women who face abuse and violence now not publicly come out and talk about their pain? They are not demanding justice, they are not asking for prosecution in Indian courts where a simple divorce case would take years, they are asking to be heard. And the identity of the accused, his political affiliations and the ideology he wears on his sleeves matters little to them. Shehryar Khanum, one of the members of KWC, tells me that the only thing that should matter and remains the principal focus for them as an organisation is not the identity of the accused but the suffering of the victim. The entire narrative, she explains, has to rewoven around women. I concur. When fourteen sexual harassment cases hit us at all at once, even at that moment if we refuse to talk about the sufferings of women who were young and braved the work to make careers in journalism, who were hit hard by the reality of male-dominance at the work place, but instead go on to discuss if KWC has pro-State affiliations or separatist tendencies, the whole idea behind the movement stands negated. This moment belongs neither to the KWC nor to the accused; it belongs to the survivors who braved a patriarchal society to come forward and pull the curtains off of crimes our society has brushed under the carpet for years. It should force us to collectively talk about the idea of consent, of the absolute discretion of a woman to say a “no”. Talib Hussain repeatedly tried to “console” his victim by telling her that he would do   with her. It did not occur to him that he did not violate her chastity but her personhood, her being. One of the KWC members was publicly accused of being in a consensual relationship with her boss, a charge she vehemently refutes. But let us assume for a second that it is true, how does being in a “consensual” relationship become an accusation? It is therefore pertinent that the civil society of Kashmir starts a loud and open discourse on the idea of consent. And women's organisations could play a fundamental in initiating this debate. After repeated character assassination plots, death threats, political and ideological tagging, everything KWC has braved, Shehryar tells me, is not lost. “When I go any cafe, I see everyone talking about #MeToo; this is the only topic of discussion around these days. Wasn't this the fundamental motive of #MeToo, to have society discuss sexual harassment out in the open?” Miles away from the Valley, lawyer Indira Jaising publicly   her association with Talib Hussain, and announced her unilateral decision to not appear on behalf of Talib as a pro-bono lawyer. Both these stories have a common thread running right through them — time’s up! ",2018-10-21,"Kathua rape and murder,Mannan wani,Kashmir women's collective,Metoo india",#MeToo: Women get a voice in Kashmir.

133,Sania Mariam,"Migration is increasingly becoming a forced choice. According to acclaimed journalist P Sainath, the increase in migration is driven by the . Massive migrations have gone hand-in-hand with a deepening agrarian crisis, with more than  reported in the agricultural sector since 2013. The actual number is expected to be much higher. Migration from rural areas to cities has been a usual natural phenomenon. So what makes migration in last two decades different? In the past two decades, what we witnessed was a “despair-driven exodus” —  — from the countryside, where millions of Indians were trapped in “footloose” migrations.  The poor drifted from place to place “without a clear final destination”. With agriculture becoming uneconomical and little scope for non-farm employment back home, migration to distant urban towns became a necessity. Despite the much-hyped economic growth of India, there has been no real change in this grim situation. Jharkhand is not new to distress migration. The Economic Survey of India revealed that Jharkhand   age population between 2001 and 2011 due to migration. More than 5% of the working age population in Jharkhand migrates annually to other states in search of better employment opportunities, education or because of loss of traditional livelihood. An important development the survey has thrown up is the rise in female migration in the decade 2001-11 across the country. Female migration has almost doubled since the last study was conducted in 1991-2001, and is now almost the same as male migrants. However, a survey conducted by the state’s skill development department in 2011 showed that 80% of respondents had not observed any improvement in their economic condition since their family members had migrated. The situation has only worsened. Changing agricultural practices have aggravated distress migration. Contrary to what is usually believed, a recent publication by Bindrai Institute for Research Study & Action (BIRSA), titled ‘Agrarian Crisis in Jharkhand: Results of a Farmer Survey’, found that 94% farmers not only want to continue farming, but also want their children to take up agriculture. The study is based on a survey of 493 farming households spread across 11 districts, and comes at a time when the dominant economic thinking is that farmers want to quit agriculture if given a choice. A third of surveyed households had a migrant worker looking for a menial job in some faraway place like Maharashtra or Gujarat. Given a choice, the respondents wanted to stay back and continue farming. The challenge before the state, therefore, is how to make farming economically viable. However, the report highlights that blindly adopting intensive farming systems in a bid to catch up with the green revolution bowl of Punjab, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh is not the way forward. The study reveals that Jharkhand offers a unique opportunity to create a development model based on its own geography, biological resources and peculiar agro-climatic conditions. It envisages a shift from intensive farming practices, which, incompatible with ecological needs as they contaminates groundwater, have led to more pollution and reversed the terms of trade. The agrarian crisis is essentially caused by government’s long-term neglect of agriculture. The report provides cues on the various dimensions of agrarian crisis faced by Jharkhand’s farmers, and the apathy of successive governments who failed to address their needs. At present, the Jharkhand government’s private sector-led input intensive farming model has failed to ensure food security for farmers. This can be correlated with the fact that Jharkhand ranks the worst among states in terms of both proportion of underweight children under 5 years (48%), and prevalence of wasting (weight for height) in children under 5 years (29%). An economic development model based on the introduction of sustainable farming practices, encouraging traditional pulses and grains and integrated with forestry and animal husbandry, is the way forward.  It will not only achieve household security, but also nutritional security. The report has highlighted lack of facilities like micro-irrigation, marketing yards, electricity, cheap organised credit, village link roads, cold storages as some of the immediate reasons for the continuing crisis. Such prevailing conditions can be linked directly to the withdrawal of public sector investment from agriculture. With cuts in social sector spending, it no longer remains a mystery as to why distress migration becomes a necessity. The report claims that agriculture has been deliberately kept impoverished to hasten the process of rural to urban migration. The timely publication of the report asks for redrawing the agricultural map of Jharkhand, based on their three dominant agro-ecological zones. Perhaps, it’s time that the government focuses of meeting the demands of adivasi farmers. However, even seemingly simple changes may ask for structural reorientation. Ex-hybrid rice is increasingly being favoured instead of cultivation of millets. Farmers, however, want to bring back the cultivation of millets. It’s not only nutritious, but also one of the best protections against food insecurity. The pricing and procurement policy needs to be redesigned in order to provide an assured procurement for millets and traditional pulses and encourage its cultivation. Will this alone lead to an end of distress migration? Probably not. However, it will ensure food security and adequate nutrition for our vulnerable populations, and create a safety net for migrant populations. The question then arises: Is the government willing to reconsider its agricultural policies? Let’s hope they do.",2018-10-20,"Distress migration,Farmer suicides,Farming,Jharkhand","Jharkhand: No, farmers don’t want to give up farming.

134,Rahul Noronha,"If there is one thing that makes the BJP ecstatic in Madhya Pradesh before any election, it is those stories of disunity within the Congress. Aware of the glee it leads to for the BJP, the Congress leadership had been attempting to at least put on a show of unity in the run-up to the elections. Congress leaders in MP, or the big three — Digvijaya Singh, Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia — had reached a tactical understanding of sorts, that they would not let CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan get the better of them this time, that their personal differences would not be the reason for the Congress remaining out of power any more. But has this tactical understanding now stretched to its limits? There are signs of stress. A few days ago, a video of Digvijaya began doing the rounds on social media in which he appealed to party men to remain united ‘even if their enemy gets the party nomination’. The BJP — that had been waiting long for clear signs of stress between Congress leaders — jumped at the opportunity. Chouhan offered his shoulder to Digvijaya, saying that the pain inflicted on the former CM was a doing of his own party men. PM Modi, too, while interacting with party workers said that the Congress had three CM candidates in MP. Minister Vishwas Sarang went a step further and said the Congress was low on sanskaars, because it did not know how to treat its senior leaders. Of course, Sarang did not consider the way the members of the margdarshak mandal were being treated within the BJP. A day later, Digvijaya was called by Rahul Gandhi to accompany him to Delhi from Gwalior where he participated in a successful road show. This is not the first time, the former CM felt marginalised during the campaign. During Gandhi’s Bhopal visit, a series of cutouts showing Congress leaders did not include his. The BJP yet again was very ‘upset’ at the treatment meted out to him. Bhopal is also rife with theories that all is not too well between PCC president Kamal Nath and campaign committee chief Jyotiraditya Scindia either. Issues include distribution of tickets and that the camaraderie on display whenever Gandhi and Scindia meet upsets Nath. The BJP is propagating all such theories. Post-ticket distribution is a crucial aspect that distinguishes the BJP from the Congress and therein lies the difference between victory and defeat. While BJP has a better record of containing leaders who turn rebel when denied tickets, disappointed Congressmen just stay at home. The result is that a part of the voters of the party don’t go to the polling booth to vote, which benefits the BJP. There are also theories floating around in Bhopal that the Congress president will announce Scindia as the Congress CM candidate a week before polling — in a similar manner as Captain Amarinder Singh was named before the Punjab elections. But in Punjab, there was no other leader who could have been projected as the CM. Captain Amarinder Singh had led the election single-handedly. This is not the case in MP. Every leader has been asked to fulfil different roles, based on their strengths. So, if Kamal Nath is overseeing the organisation and finances, Scindia is campaigning and Digvijaya is doing the back-room management; to prevent divisions among Congressmen. More importantly, Chouhan is waiting for the Congress to declare a CM candidate so that he can then turn it into a contest between the   and the  or the   and  . Chouhan’s popularity, as per  ’s   is intact at 48 per cent, higher than anyone in the Congress, be it Scindia with 32 per cent, Nath with 8 per cent or Digvijaya at 2 per cent. The bonhomie between Scindia and Gandhi is due to a comfort zone the two share. Gandhi is only trying to balance leaders in MP for his party. But one wrong step and the massive egos of Congress leaders would come into play. BJP then has the election on a platter. Will the Congress oblige?

135,Manjeet Sehgal,"Punjab farmers burn more than 15 lakh tonnes of stubble every year, out of a total of 100 lakh tonnes of mismanaged farm residue. The state produces nearly 220 lakh tonnes of stubble, out of which only 50 lakh tonnes is being used to produce biomass power generation. The state, in order to obey the NGT orders, however, imposes fines on the farmers found guilty of burning the paddy straws. Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh   he cannot stop poor farmers from burning the paddy straws. Often called as country's food bowl, here are five reasons why Punjab farmers have been compelled to burn the farm residue: Often targeted by the state pollution control board, Punjab’s farmers feel victimised as cases against them are being registered for burning paddy straws. The state government has directed the district authorities to levy fines up to Rs 2,500 per acre. Farmers say that their avocation is no more profitable and that they are not able to recover even crop input costs — that have incidentally gone up thanks to rising fuel, pesticide, insecticide costs and taxes. Crop failures have too broken their backbone. Punjab and Haryana authorities have, so far, fined   farmers respectively this year. The Punjab government has no resources to compensate the farmers and to stop them from burning the farm residue. Even though the state government has announced a   on zero tilling or crop residue machines like happy seeders, bailers, rotavators and hydraulic ploughs, the farmers have been unable to modernise their agricultural practices due to their poor purchasing power ""A bailer machine costs Rs 18 lakhs and if hired they charge Rs 2,000 per acre. Got this field on lease of Rs three lakhs and the rice crop which I harvested were worth Rs 1.5 lakhs. You tell me how I will meet the additional cost of Rs 2,000 per acre. The government is asking us to buy the machinery to manage paddy straws but not telling from where we should get the money,"" says Rattan Pal a Mohali farmer. The farm residue machinery manufacturers have now increased the cost of rotavators following the subsidy announced by the state government on such machines. The rotavator machines that were earlier available at Rs 85,000 are now being sold at Rs 1.30 lakhs each. Some well-to-do farmers, who had bought seeder machines, have begun leasing them out, charging anything between Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 per acre. Rising fuel prices have also compelled farmers to avoid machinery like these. In many cases, the tractors engines owned by farmers have proven unsuitable for farm-residue clearing machines. Punjab's farmers have committed suicides due to cash crop failures in which case, they are unable to repay loans. The government which announced a loan waiver is compelling them to raise additional loans. According to NCRB data, between 2013 and 2016, over 542 farmers and farm labourers   in Punjab. Out of them, 271 killed themselves in 2016. 129 farmers committed suicide in first four months of the Congress government and 49 killed themselves after the loan-waiver scheme was announced. Another reason why farmers resort to crop-residue burning is the paucity of time. Farmers only have around 15 to 20 days to sow wheat and potato crops after the paddy crop is harvested. Burning the residue is the shortest and most economical method for the farmers to get rid of straws. However, this method has been suffocating the residents of the National Capital Territory. The Centre and the Punjab government have locked horns on the issue of providing compensation to the state farmers in order to stop them from burning crop residues. Punjab has demanded Rs 100 per quintal as a grant for farmers. Farm unions have been demanding Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 to manage farm residue. But the Union government has seems to have ignored the demand. Captain Amrinder Singh has written to the Prime Minister twice already. “The straws cannot be uprooted unless money is available. I have written two times to the Prime Minister that you give us Rs 100 per quintal for this purpose specifically. I am afraid Government of India has not come up of it,"" Captain Amrinder Singh said. There are 17.5 lakh families in Punjab who own farm holdings. Of them, 10.25 lakh families own holdings measuring less than five acres and are poor.

 Undoubtedly, Akbar’s resignation is a big win for the gender justice movement — a concrete proof that women’s voices matter, that powerful men can, and will, face consequences for their actions.   However, it is no credit to the BJP government at the Centre. Ever since Akbar stepped down, social media has been abuzz about how there was   “from the very top”, “made it clear” it was not happy with the state of affairs, and that women ministers felt the situation had become  . No, the government, the BJP and RSS do not get brownie points for this. In fact, their actions have been shockingly inadequate. MJ Akbar is still a Rajya Sabha MP, he has slapped one of his accusers with a defamation case, and the government has not spoken a word against him.    His resignation is not justice served — it is the first, bare minimum step. It does not mean the battle is over. And it most definitely does not whitewash the conduct of the government, which needs to answer some tough questions.   Not pulling up a minister for allegations as serious as this is not just moral irresponsibility. It shows a worrying mindset that believes sexual harassment at workplace is not a serious enough issue. And this mindset now seems visible not just in acts of omission, but of commission. According to reports, the government   a proposal by one of its own ministers — Maneka Gandhi, the only one from the ruling establishment to take a firm stand on #MeToo —to set up a committee of retired judges to probe the allegations that have surfaced on social media. Instead, the government will set up a   (GoM) under Rajnath Singh to examine anti-sexual harassment laws and guidelines in force in the country. It is not clear yet if the GoM will also perform the important job the panel proposed by Maneka was supposed to do. Let’s go over the BJP and the government’s response to the #MeToo movement.   Breaking the BJP’s official silence on the issue, Amit Shah on October 12 seemingly  the truthfulness of Akbar’s accusers, saying: ""We have to check the veracity of the post and the person who posted it. You can also post something using my name. We will definitely look into the issue."" Union minister Sushma Swaraj, Akbar’s direct boss, had refused to comment on the issue despite direct questions. All the usually fiery Smriti Irani  : “I appreciate that the media is accosting his (former) female colleagues but I think it is for the gentleman concerned to issue a statement (and) not for me because I was personally not present there.”  Things get worse as you go down the hierarchy — Union Minister of State for Shipping and Finance, Pon Radhakrishnan,  : “If someone makes an allegation that such a thing happened.....when the incident happened we were playing together while in class 5....Would it be fair? ""This (MeToo movement) is the result of the behavior of some people who have perverted minds.” BJP MP Udit Raj   #MeToo was “the beginning of a wrong practice”, since women are known to extort money and honey-trap men and cannot always be trusted. Our otherwise eloquent Prime Minister, who gave us the inspiring 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' slogan, has said nothing at all. The BJP’s track record on the gender justice issue is none too shiny. Its state ministers   in favour of the men accused of gang-raping and killing an eight-year-old girl in Kathua. Its Unnao MLA,   — accused of raping a woman whose father died in police custody after she complained — continues to remain in the party. The BJP also has the dubious distinction of MPs and MLAs accused of crimes against women.   The #MeToo movement could have been an opportunity for the party to improve its credentials. #MeToo is more than about one person. It’s about women challenging an exploitative culture ingrained since ages.   Instead of recognising it for the defining moment that it could have been in how genders interact with each other, the BJP government chose to make it about its minister. Not caring if this approach kicked in the gut a nascent movement that seeks justice for the traditionally disadvantaged, the party decided to brazen out the accusation, and backed down only when it realised it was facing far too much bad press for an electorally inconsequential minister.   The brave women who spoke out in the #MeToo campaign have done their part. It is now up to institutions to redress their grievances, and come up with mechanisms to usher in a culture where it is easier to report crimes and expect justice —something every citizen of this country is entitled to.

137,Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd,"Despite their sharp differences, one thing that unites radical Hindu men and Muslim male fundamentalists is their opposition to gender equality within their respective communities. The Supreme Court order allowing women of all ages to enter Lord Ayyappa's   is being opposed by the right-wing forces just as Muslim fundamentalist organisations didn't agree with the striking down of instant  . What is absolutely ironical is that the   has been mobilising women against women’s right to spiritual equality in Hinduism. Radical Hindu men, just like their fundamentalist Muslim counterparts in India and the world over, believe that a woman's body is impure because of her menstrual cycle. They, however, feel a man and his body is absolutely pure and spiritually superior. Hence, men of all ages can go to all temples, but women are not allowed to enjoy that equality. The radical Muslim men also believe in imposing purity-related restrictions on women. Added to that is the burden of burqa culture to avoid arousing impure thoughts in men. They believe that a woman’s body should be zealously guarded from men. The radical Hindu men are doing exactly the same thing. The RSS is quite open about it now and I am glad it has finally shed the cloak.     The notion of men’s 'prerogative' to divorce a woman in a manner he likes and chooses is still treated by many Muslim men as a divine right. But the Hindu men from radical Hindu organisations believed that the Muslim women must be liberated and the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre supported that ""cause"" before the Supreme Court. And once the instant triple talaq judgment was out, the  But the same BJP government opposed the entry of Hindu women (of menstruating age) into the Ayyappa temple. Right-wing forces are now mobilising Hindu women against Hindu women’s right to spiritual equality.   Does that mean the RSS/BJP want freedom and equality for Muslim women, but are opposed to Hindu women enjoying equal rights as men? The issue of women’s equality following the Sabarimala judgment is, quite understandably, being seen as a 'leftist' verdict. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is being targeted for his resolve to implement the SC verdict. While the  , in Kerala, it is supporting the most imprudent Shudra approach by the  (the most cruel Shudra patriarchal society that supported Sambandham marriages for a long time in history). The NSS, with the tacit support of the Congress, is mobilising the Nair women against themselves. Nair women were forced to live as concubines of youngest Brahmin sons for centuries. Now, they do not want the women to visit a temple in Kerala. The Nair men implement all Brahminical rules against their own women. They have no sense of self-respect. Whatever was written as temple code by Brahmin spiritual theoreticians, these Nair men are happily implementing that. According to the Agama Shastras (written by Brahmins), Shudras, including Nairs, don't have the right to priesthood. The same pundits wrote that women should not enter temples and the Nairs want to implement it at their own cost. Ayyappa is also known as a chief God of the Shudras. The temple bhakts are mostly Shudras, but the rules are written by Brahmins. The black dress code for Ayyappa devotees, the ritual singing for Ayyappa is entirely Periyarite. Periyar Ramaswamy Naikar from nearby Tamil Nadu took over the black dress code from Ayyappa only.   No Shudra temple in India has written rules that discriminate between men and women. In fact, the Shudra faith is mostly intertwined around female Goddesses. Most of the Shudra Goddesses are women. From the famous Telugu Goddess Pochamma to Durga and Kali, Goddesses don't discriminate between men and women. It is only the RSS/BJP-led right wing which is destroying the egalitarian spiritual systems. Now, Ayyappa is being pitted against women. Good that the Supreme Court, except a female judge, saw through Lord Ayyappa’s egalitarian spiritualism.    Apart from Muslim women, the RSS/BJP mobilised their own, even non-Muslim women activists, against triple talaq.   Similarly, several Muslim organisations mobilised their women to protest against their own right to dignified and safe divorce. What is worse is now the RSS/BJP and   are making their own Hindu women further perpetuate the notion of impurity of women and their bodies and shout slogans of opposition against ""defiling the pure male Ayyappa God”. This is like what the Shudra masses believed that ""they are inferior and should never become priests in any Hindu temple"". The radical Hindu and Muslim men want no change in the man-woman equation (read gender inequality) both in the spiritual society — at temples and masjids — as well as civil society. The changes brought by the Indian judiciary — by carefully considering all human relations, particularly the man-woman equation — in the light of the Constitution is being opposed by such fundamentalist forces even when sitting in positions of power. This is true of all such men whether in India or Pakistan (a theocratic state). The  . In Pakistan, successive governments have done that. At the time of the triple talaq issue, a lot of Hindu men and women — in TV channels, newspapers, social media and other public forums —pretended to be liberators of women — the Muslim women, to be precise. The same men and women are now saying faith is more important than reason and equality. They believe that the Constitution and judiciary cannot unsettle faith. Now, the Indian Constitution and judiciary are being attacked as anti-Hindu because the SC judgment built a legal theory for man-woman equality as it did in the case of triple talaq. The BJP/RSS has shown its real face in the aftermath of the Sabarimala verdict. Whether in was triple talaq or the Sabarimala issue, the Supreme Court decision was a step in the right direction. Quite surprisingly, the radical Hindu men are quite vocal in defending the triple talaq judgment. However, the radical and liberal Muslim men and women are not getting involved in the Sabarimala judgment. They left it to the Hindus to decide. But the radical Hindus working in the RSS/BJP do not leave Muslim religious matter to Muslims.   One hopes that the RSS/BJP would realise the ill-effects of this kind of patriarchal Hindu spiritual movement on the national morale as well as constitutional democracy. They want to push the Shudra/OBC/Dalit/Adivasi women further into a corner just as they did with the Brahmin women.  There is a need for a counter-mobilisation by women and men across the country, particularly the Shudras (including the Shudra upper caste men and women, unlike the NSS forces). The OBCs, Dalit and Adivasi forces must save the Shudra worshippers of Ayyappa from the Namboodiri Brahmanical patriarchy and the anti-women (and anti-Dalit) culture it has perpetrated for generations.          ",2018-10-17,"Pinarayi Vijayan,Kerala,Lord Ayyappa,Sabarimala protests",Sabarimala: Why BJP wants to 'empower' Muslim women but is against equal rights for its Hindu daughters,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sabarimala-why-bjp-wants-to-empower-muslim-women-triple-talaq-but-is-against-equal-rights-for-their-own-hindu-daughters/story/1/27284.html
138,Sadhavi Khosla,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2003 under the leadership of Uma Bharti, replacing the 10-year-old Digvijay Singh-led Congress government. The reasons of this succession were loud and clear: the state of Madhya Pradesh was “underdeveloped” to an extent that even international bodies like UNDP had started ranking the state with countries like Rwanda, Senegal and Madagascar in their Human Development Index. Every single thing from basic infrastructure to assurance of subsistence for the deprived went missing. The anti-incumbency was such that when the state went for polling, the Congress could merely secure 38 seats as opposed to the BJP which won 178 seats out of the 230 assemblies that went to polls. The leadership of the BJP after the formation of government saw various ups and downs in the first two years, as Uma Bharti was forced to   after her alleged involvement in the 1994 Hubli riots and later Babulal Gaur who   he was “forced to resign” to make way for Shivraj Singh Chauhan. While a “BIMARU” Madhya Pradesh did start its journey on the path of development under Shivraj, did Shivraj actually succeed in fulfilling his tall list of promises? From where he picked, the Chief Minister did succeed in providing power supply, built road networks, introduced schemes like the Ladli Yojna etc., retain tourism and brought industries to the state. However, all is not well in Shivraj’s Madhya Pradesh. The state under his leadership has witnessed the worst and has seen the darker side of politics. The most significant issues at the centre are:  “Kisan ka beta” Shivraj has not only denied but has also failed to acknowledge the problems faced by farmers. He only used farmers as a tool for gaining electoral votes, even as he failed to address their issues like that of loan waiver, support prices. In the last ten years alone, more than   have committed suicide. The intentions of this government became crystal clear last year, when the Madhya Pradesh police opened fire on farmers in  , who were protesting against the government. A Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme — the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana — too has been rife with   and irregularities. In the upcoming assembly elections, farmers’ crisis will be one of the most important issues upon which the fate of next party in power in Madhya Pradesh rests.  Madhya Pradesh under the BJP rule has only been volatile. Not only has the crime rate risen, but closer to elections the atmosphere in general has been intense. The government has botched up promises to protect the women, children, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/STs) in the state. In fact, in 2017, according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, MP had the sharpest increase in  . The failure of law and order of the state can certainly be attributed to the ruling government. The increasing crime rate in Madhya Pradesh, specifically against women and SC/STs, has placed the state at the top of the table. Perhaps, the only protection that the women, girl children and SC/STs have is hoardings announcing schemes — the reality, of course, tells a different tale. In Ujjain, the Simhastha Kumbh Mela was not spared the shadow of alleged  . While the Congress alleged a Rs 1500 crore scam, the government, in general, has been accused of overspending even on basic necessities at the Kumbh. The Shivraj government is still facing heat over the Vyapam scam, where not only were frauds given seats in medical colleges but exams like that for SSC was dented as well. The deaths of both accusers as well as whistleblowers in Vyapam must also be noted — both sides have witnessed the death of more than 45 people so far. The arrests in the case have also put the government and the bureaucracy in the dock. So far, the Supreme Court has cancelled degrees of   and The CBI has charge-sheeted 592, but Shivraj and his government are yet to take any significant action. The Shivraj government’s indifference towards offering the state’s youth a better future became more evident after the   came into light — funds allocated for scholarship of tribal students were allegedly siphoned off. While the scam was a multi-crore scam, the exact amount is yet to be announced even though the scam came to light in 2013. The latest scam that shook the state was the  , where the online procurement platform of the Madhya Pradesh government was allegedly manipulated to favour a select few private companies. Suspected to have been going on for years now, it was exposed only in May this year when bidding for contracts was underway for the Madhya Pradesh Jal Nigam. The scam is estimated to be worth more than Rs 3000 crore. The Sardar Sarovar Project has been an issue central to the political and social dynamics of Madhya Pradesh. While the state governments of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat plead benefits if the project came to fruition, the social, environmental and rehabilitation cost — an issue which was clearly ignored — has been the epicentre of the Narmada protests. Often referred to as the lifeline of the state, the Narmada River has been at the centre stage after Shivraj Singh’s five-month-long   (Namami Devi Narmade) that lasted from December, 2016 to May, 2017. The amount which was spent on this “ ” along with the promises made around the Narmada River has also been questioned. From state of records to saplings being planted, to illegal sand mining and environmental damage, every issue has been highlighted, specifically by spiritual leaders in Madhya Pradesh. The fear of “Narmada Ghotala Yatra” (a yatra to be lead by the spiritual heads) was such that the CM gave five spiritual heads Minister of State status.  The Shivraj government has failed in assuring and working towards the welfare of the people. While the rate of malnutrition is increasing in the state, the sex ratio and infant mortality rate, on the other hand, are on the decline. As an underdeveloped state with a large percentage of tribal population, the state government chose not to identify and realise the needs of the community. The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has lacked in providing employment to the youth, and the declining literacy rate of the state is enough to realise what vision the chief minister and his cabinet have for the state. The assurances of development have been nothing but a chimera; the state of Madhya Pradesh under Shivraj has not been able to fulfil the needs or provide physical development, economic development, social development and even cultural development. Smart Cities, for instance, have only brought money to the state but the state has chosen not to develop at all. Four years and massive funding have amounted to absolutely nothing. Does the CM not owe an apology to the people of MP who put their faith in him for 12 years, when not even one section of the society can claim to be benefitted by this government While the problems with and the anger against the leadership of Shivraj and the BJP in Madhya Pradesh are immense, what has the Opposition done to win the battle of 2018? The Indian National Congress is the single largest Opposition party in Madhya Pradesh and therefore the biggest threat to the BJP. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that the blunders committed by the BJP have given the Congress ample opportunities to regain the trust of people in the state, but so far, it has all been in vain. While Shivraj stands tall, as does the BJP — because they have a united front — the Congress has lacked miserably in putting up a united face. There are primarily three major factions and two or three regional factions within the Congress in Madhya Pradesh. The first faction is led by Digvijay Singh, who not only has a great hold in the Chambal region, but owing to this Chief Ministerial term, is a known face across the state. The second in line is Jyotiraditya Scindia, who rules the Chambal region as well. Due to his dynamic term with the UPA-1 and 2 and with the badge of royal political dynasty, Scindia too is a known face in the state. The third faction is that of Kamal Nath, who has been largely known for his national politics. At the state level Kamal Nath has not been known beyond Chhindwara. The other regional factions include that of Arun Yadav (Ex-PCC chief), Ajay Singh (CLP leader) and Jitu Patwari (Indian Youth Congress face for Madhya Pradesh). All of them together count for their separate vote banks which have now become a trouble spot for Congress in the state, as the politics that revolves around these factions is complex. The existing factions within the Congress have not only damaged the party but have been the primary reason for the failure of the party to gain support within the state. The region-wise polarisation has reduced the authenticity of the grand-old Congress party in the state. With such massive issues and the people’s anger to bank on and fight for, the Congress is yet to fill in the gap and win the trust of the people before it goes to vote. The absence of a leadership — who could become the voice of entire Madhya Pradesh — and the inability of the Congress to build a leader with mass appeal beyond their regions in the last 15 years is troublesome for the grand old party. Despite a very strong anti-incumbency, weak organisational structure of the Congress has made an election with clear choices, one of the most difficult ones. Not only has the Congress been unable to deal with the backlash of the government under Digvijay Singh, but it has also failed to be a good Opposition party in the state. Despite the shortcomings of Digvijay Singh-led government, he still has a major influence and role to play in the existing state elections. The fact that he is being sidelined is not a good sign for the Congress party — and could inflict potential damage on the party as they march towards polling in November. The problems for Congress don’t end there. The real problem would begin once the party starts handing out tickets to its potential candidates. The process of ticket distribution has been very debatable and difficult for the party; for it fails to strike the right balance and has often, in this process, lost party workers, members and leaders. Despite being out of power for 15 years, the party has delayed its campaign; one that became visible only six months ahead of the elections. The party may be trying its level best to appease its Hindu voters and Hindu population of Madhya Pradesh through campaigns like   and extensive campaigning by Rahul Gandhi — their promises are noteworthy — but all efforts that the party takes now are either too little or too late. The challenge for the Congress and the Opposition also lies in gaining the trust of first-time voters, who have not witnessed the power and term of any other party but the BJP. The women voters, the trading class and the tribal folk are again, other significant sections who seek a lot from the Opposition. But the Opposition is yet to put on its “game-face”. The Madhya Pradesh assembly elections in 2018, is a make-or-break situation for the Congress in the state. The stronghold of the party in the rural areas, majorly among the backward classes, has declined and alongside the growing popularity of the BJP in the state. The Congress, thus, has to bring its own supporters back. It also has to win over neutral voters. It is both disturbing as well as surprising to the see that the Congress is still unprepared to win back the trust of the people and power from the BJP. The weakness of the Opposition can be gauged from instances like calls for fake voters in the voters list; in this case the Opposition itself has not been able to sustain and stick to its allegations— they lost the legal battle in the Courts. The BJP, therefore, has an edge over the organisationally-weak Congress. The troubles for Congress are also not limited to just their scores with BJP or internal problems — it also has to do with how its partners from Mahagathbandhan are treating the grand old party in the assembly politics. With Mayawati (BSP) parting ways first and Akhilesh Yadav (SP) and Sharad Pawar (NCP) following suit, the road to 2019 for the Congress has not been easy. And, one should not underestimate the power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the election strategy of Amit Shah. Both have been proven in the past in Gujarat as well as Karnataka. While the Congress posed a commendable challenge to the BJP, and even seemed to garner the favour of voters, Modi’s rhetoric in the last 10 days before polling changed the scenario and made it rather difficult for the Congress to sustain their momentum. While Rajasthan seems favourable for the Congress, for the BJP, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are well within the limits of the current ruling party, despite severe anti-incumbency against their respective state governments. Especially in the case of Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj is still the first choice as chief minister and Shivraj and Modi together are prepared to woo the voters of the state. Despite flaws, the ruling government is still going strong because the Opposition is failing to give its voters a chance to believe in them. The fate of Madhya Pradesh will be sealed on November 28, yet the chasm from both ends is worth people’s attention and concern!",2018-10-16,"Anti-incumbency,Digvijay singh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections,Congress",Why Shivraj Singh Chouhan's many failures may still not be enough for Congress to win MP,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/congress-madhya-pradesh-assembly-polls-shivraj-singh-chouhan-bjp-anti-incumbency/story/1/27264.html

The Ulaganayagan (a universal star/people's hero), however, has made it clear time and again that the work for building his party is underway and its main focus will be to bring an end to corruption. While political analysts have been calling this agenda of ""ending corruption"" a vague idea without any concrete plans to address the problems of voters, they have also been pointing at how Kamal Haasan needs to prove his mettle as a politician first to win the people’s vote. In a recent interview with a popular  , his response to a question over alliance with the Congress became the talking point. Haasan said: ""I don't know. We need to talk to them. First let’s see what good they can give to Tamil Nadu. Their past record of what they have done is very little."" Haasan had from the beginning said that though his party will have a ""Dravidian touch"", he would not form an alliance with the  . This statement was further read by most as Hassan hinting at an alliance with the Congress without the DMK in the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Today, in an exclusive interview to India Today, Makkal Needhi Maiam chief Haasan clarified his statement. “The alliance was suggested by the interviewer. I have not committed to anything yet. It is too early to comment or commit about an alliance,” he said. As Haasan attempted to clear the air, the question whether the actor-politician is shooting in the dark or has some real plans also kept rearing its head during his press meet. “I don’t think he is shooting in the dark. Building a party is not a one-election affair. Yes, NTR did it and Arvind Kejriwal too to an extent, but circumstances were vastly different. Tamil Nadu has been about alliances and Makkal Needhi Maiam is still an infant in Tamil Nadu politics,"" said senior political analyst TS Sudhir. ""So, while he will need to consolidate his party, tying up for elections could make him a bigger player and give him a wider canvas,” Sudhir added. Haasan has been a much-admired actor and his popularity can be gauged with the jostling he manages to pull in during his rallies or district tours as they call it. But if this adulation will convert into votes is the question. “He has been getting the attention so far because he is a celebrated actor. Haasan, in the film industry, has often been accused of being a one-man show. That will not work in politics. He will have to invest in teamwork to make his political production a success,” added TS Sudhir. Cinema and politics have always been inseparable in the state of Tamil Nadu.

140,Shantanu Mukharji,"The Supreme Court of Pakistan has  its judgment on the much hyped and sensational case of Asia Bibi, the 47-year-old Christian Pakistani on whom charges of blasphemy were slapped more than nine years ago on June 14, 2009. It was alleged that she had made blasphemous remarks against Prophet Muhammad. In Pakistan, punishment for blasphemy is death and if at all the court awards a lenient verdict — reducing the death sentence to life imprisonment — the one on death row is unlikely to escape the mob frenzy. Asia has been on the death row since November, 2010. The Lahore High Court had earlier confirmed the death sentence, dashing the hopes of the verdict being commuted to a life sentence. Asia’s husband, Ashiq Mia, is running from pillar to post, trying to garner support for a reprieve and to create favourable public opinion. He even approached the Vatican and other international Catholic institutions for support. However, hope is slim, especially now that human rights activist Asma Jahangir is no more to plead Asia’s case. Pakistan is bereft of bold voices that would air concern on such grim issues. One has to wonders if Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist of international recognition, could mobilise substantial public opinion that would urge the international human rights activists, organisations and journalists to speak up for Asia Bibi. Appeals to Amnesty International have not worked. Pakistan’s indifference towards liberal laws is well known.

His voice was stifled by a 22-year-old radicalised youth. Qadri turned into a  overnight and was commended for silencing an anti-blasphemy law man.

A major chunk of the Pakistani society is venomously regressive and has no tolerance for anything that challenges their religious beliefs and unless their mindset changes, relaxation of stringent laws will remain a tough challenge. That being said, there exist saner and forward-thinking people in the country, but incidents like these discourage them from openly asserting their views, for the fear of either being ostracised or being harassed — legally as well — is very real. The judiciary too is helpless. One has to wonder — Bangladesh that was once part of Pakistan has progressed rather well since its inception 47 years ago. Secularists, liberals and progressives enjoy a fair amount of say in the society; they have helped in shaping public opinion through the dynamism of theatre, films, literature, media and use of intelligentsia. Yet, Pakistan — independence more than 70 years —has not made much visible strides. Meanwhile, as Asia Bibi’s mercy petition is under submission, her fate hangs in balance and the judgment is reserved by the Supreme Court. Interestingly, during the trial, Justice Iqbal Hameed Ur Rehman, one of three members of the Supreme Court bench recused himself from the hearing, stating that he was the judge who had heard the case of Salman Taseer’s assassination. According to Justice Mian Saqib Nisar of the Supreme Court, Justice Rahman  that his presence in the bench may prejudice Asia Bibi’s case as it was closely linked to Salman Taseer.

141,Sharat Pradhan,"Ever since a united Opposition handed out a devastating defeat to the BJP in   in Uttar Pradesh earlier this year, a formula to challenge the one-man army of PM Narendra Modi seemed to have been found —  a ‘mahagathbandhan’, or a grand alliance. Sure enough, it was the bonhomie between sworn political foes — Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) — supported by Congress and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), that did the impossible in Kairana, Phulpur and Gorakhpur.   For the BJP, which had taken the divided Opposition for granted, it was a wake-up call. For others, it gave birth to the idea of a grand alliance for the big battle of the ballot in 2019. Of course, UP was considered the most crucial of all states, since the NDA had bagged an all-time high number of 73 out of the state’s 80 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. However, even before the prospective partners could sit across the table to work out the modalities of a grand alliance, chinks began to surface. The first shock came with Shivpal Yadav’s  with the Samajwadi Party and the formation of his Samajwadi Secular Morcha. This was suspected to be the handiwork of Amar Singh, who, after his unceremonious exit from SP, was busy looking for a space to park himself in the BJP.  But just as the SP leadership was trying to convince all and sundry that Shivpal’s betrayal was no big deal, there came a bigger jolt, which seemed to shake the very foundations of the proposed ‘mahagathbandhan’. One by one, the BSP, and then the SP,  with the Congress in the three states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, set to go to poll over the next two months. Elections in these three crucial states are being seen as a semi-final to the ultimate battle in 2019. Surely, the falling apart of the ‘mahagathbandhan’ even before it could crystallise is good news for the ruling dispensation.   But could the grand alliance have made any significant difference in the three poll-bound states? Even as both BSP chief Mayawati and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav are trying to hype up the issue, the fact remains that neither party is of any meaningful consequence in these states. The BSP has four seats in the Rajasthan Assembly, three in Madhya Pradesh and one in Chhattisgarh. The SP holds just one seat in MP, and none in the other two. Yet, both Mayawati and Akhilesh are desperately trying to give their parties a larger-than-life profile, through their stiff posturing.  It is not as if Mayawati and Akhilesh are not aware of their party’s insignificance in all these states. But they chose to make tall demands, which they knew were disproportionate to their party’s worth. For instance, in Madhya Pradesh, Mayawati had sought 50 seats, while Akhilesh was toying with the idea of demanding 25 seats. Strangely, Mayawati’s demand was largely focused on seats that were strongholds of the BJP. It is felt that Mayawati is hoping for an indirect benefit by putting up such a hard bargain. A weak Congress suits the BSP more than anything else. Revival of the Congress party could impact the BSP negatively, as that could trigger a drift of Muslim votes towards the Congress. A section of the Scheduled Caste vote too could switch from the BSP to the Congress.   Perhaps the Congress, which undeniably remains the principal Opposition party in all three states, very rightly felt that giving away such a large chunk of the 230 MP Assembly seats could mar its own chances, in a state where the party is hoping to grab all the mileage from the BJP’s anti-incumbency. Likewise, Rajasthan is going to witness a straight contest between the sitting BJP and the Congress. Visible disillusionment of people with Vasundhra Raje Scindia is bound to benefit the Congress. Chhattisgarh, however, could be tricky for the Congress, as Chief Minister Raman Singh remains widely popular despite two terms in office. The presence of a third player, in the form of Ajit Jogi’s Janata Congress, is likely to make the Congress’s chances slimmer.   By striking an electoral deal with Jogi, Mayawati has clearly closed doors for any truck with the Congress, as Jogi himself broken away from the Grand Old Party to form his own tribal outfit.  Just as Mayawati’s tie-up with the Janata Congress is going to help the BJP in Chhattisgarh, her decision to go it alone in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan may also give some advantage to the governing party in a handful of pockets. Yet, it was always unlikely that a ‘mahagathbandhan’ could have made any significant impact on the outcome of the state elections.",2018-10-13,"Congress,Mayawati,Akhilesh Yadav,Grand Alliance","SP, BSP not to fight with Congress in three state elections: How much will this influence poll results?",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajasthan-chhattisgarh-madhya-pradesh-mayawati-akhilesh-congress-bjp/story/1/27213.html
142,Nolan Pinto,"Every year before Tipu Jayanti, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) begin sparring with each other. This time as well, the BJP decided to make it clear that they are against celebrating Tipu Jayanti in Karnataka. Pratap Simha, the BJP MP for Mysore and Kodagu, publicly asked Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy to avoid celebrations this year. During the inauguration of the Dasara celebrations in Mysore on October 8, he said, ""Kumaranna must understand why Mahishasura Dasara and Tipu Jayanti must be stopped. These kinds of celebrations seriously hurt our religious sentiments. Besides, celebrating someone who harassed the Mysore rulers is an insult to the members of the royal family."" Taking on the BJP MP for his statement on Tipu Jayanti, Zameer Ahmed Khan, Minister for Minorities Welfare, Haj and Waqf said that the protest was being done keeping in mind the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. ""The Lok Sabha elections are coming in 4-5 months. They think that if they speak against Muslims then they will get votes of other communities. For instance, we have to celebrate Tipu Jayanti. Just because he said, it does not mean we won't celebrate it,"" he said. Even Eshwar Khandre, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) working president told India Today TV that Pratap Simha is a ""communal man with his own agenda"". ""He always instigates communal trouble in the state and there is no need to give any importance to his statement,"" he added. However, S Prakash, a BJP state spokesperson, said his party has always opposed Tipu Jayanti celebrations and that people have always rejected it outright, as seen in the assembly polls where the Congress lost. He added, “Siddaramaiah paid a heavy price for this and if Kumaraswamy continues, I am sure people will punish him also.” The saffron party has time and again also stated that Tipu Sultan, the ruler of then Mysore from 1782 till his death in 1799, slaughtered several Hindus in Srirangapatna — his seat of power — and in Kodagu, which he invaded during his reign. But the BJP has also been guilty of honouring Tipu Sultan, albeit in a different way. Pictures of former chief ministers BS Yeddyurappa and Jagadish Shettar, posing as Tipu Sultan, have started doing the rounds on social media. What is worse for the saffron party is that both the former CMs have attended Tipu Sultan Jayanti events when they were in power from 2008-2013. Even President Ramnath Kovind, when he visited Karnataka, made a speech hailing Tipu Sultan. He said Tipu “died a heroic death fighting the British”, while addressing a joint session of the Karnataka legislature on 25 October, 2017. This statement really did not help the BJP cause. The Congress party has continued to maintain that Tipu Sultan, popularly known as the “Tiger of Mysore”, helped in building a progressive Mysore state and gave it technological prowess. For the Congress, the minority Muslim votes are of prime importance especially at a time when the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) has been gaining ground in Mangalore and nearby areas. But for many others, both the political parties are only using Tipu Sultan’s name for electoral gains. Once elections are over, neither party would care for Tipu Sultan. A visit to Tipu’s palaces in Srirangapatna will shock any historian with the way it has been “maintained”. The Tipu Jayanti issue was exacerbated in 2017 because of then-upcoming assembly elections in the state. Both sides hardened their stands on the issue back then and the same seems to be happening again, now in the run up to the 2019 elections. That a certain stance on the Tipu issue has helped reap dividends in the assembly election is something nobody knows for sure, but the BJP has fired the first shot this time anticipating it will, for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. But, year after year, even with Tipu Jayanti attracting a lot of flak from critics, the state government (whichever party it is) has never actually stopped celebrating it.",2018-10-15,"BJP,Karnataka,Tipu jayanti,Tipu Sultan","It's that time of the year: Congress, BJP spar over Tipu Jayanti in Karnataka.

143,Priyamvatha P,"The Governor versus media tussle going on in Tamil Nadu reached a new point on October 12, with the Raj Bhavan slamming the media for supporting “Nakkheeran” Gopal. A press statement from Raj Bhavan  “yellow journalism is being supported by respectable people.” The controversy started with the arrest of RR Gopal, the editor of Tamil magazine   for their article on a professor. This professor  for allegedly luring woman students into offering sexual favours to top officials in the Madurai Kamarajar University. The article had allegedly produced derogatory and slanderous remarks against the Governor of Tamil Nadu, Banwarilal Purohit, over his alleged links with the professor — something Purohit has steadily and vehemently denied. The Governor’s office filed a case with the police over the article, and Gopal was arrested on October 9 under Section 124 of the IPC, which is hardly used against journalists. As many among Gopal’s supporters pointed out,   “assaulting the President or Governor with intent to compel or restrain exercise of any lawful power”, and a magazine article, even if offensive in nature, cannot amount to assault. Even in the IPC, assault is defined as “whoever makes any gesture or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person is said to commit an assault.” No wonder then that the case against Gopal was  , bringing embarrassment to the police and the Governor’s office. Now, with their statement against the press, the Governor’s office has once again drawn attention to itself, with remarks the kind of which are seldom issued from such a high authority.  Apart from refuting the charges against the Governor, the statement has hit out at journalists who stood with Gopal against the arrest. In a bid to save face, the Raj Bhavan has said that “they maintained dignity for many months” but the slanderous article was not acceptable, and the statement given by the accused professor before the police “will itself bear out the truth”. “It is a matter of humour to say that press freedom is being threatened on the count, of action, being taken under the law after much patience and tolerance to stop a slanderous, vulgar, and cowardly way of attacking the first citizen of the State,""  The advisors of the Governor are missing out on a few points here. Nobody is contending that the article was written without any evidence. No copy of the claimed statement by the accused professor regarding the Governor was produced in the magazine. No attempt made to contact the Governor’s office for an official reaction. These indeed breach the ethics of journalism, and the article could surely be found defamatory by the Governor’s office. Hence, a better way to deal with this would have been to file a defamation case. Going a step ahead, if the Governor’s office had wanted to clear the air, an official could have held a press conference. What made matters worse was the use of an IPC Section which everyone knew would be struck down in a court of law. The complaint copy from the Governor’s office had asked for the use of IPC 124, without seemingly verifying the definition of the law and the context of its usage. This raises doubts if the intention was only to arrest Gopal for an article against an office of authority. If this was not enough, the statement issued by the Governor’s office on October 12 seemed more desperate, justifying the complaint filed against Nakkheeran.     Bharathi Tamizhan, the joint secretary of the Chennai Press Club, says: “Raj Bhavan officials seem confused. They should know we have nothing against the Raj Bhavan. They should be aware that the use of Section 124 against a journalist for an article is the real concern. This is the first time that the Section has been used against a journalist. We didn’t take sides with the article that was published. In fact, we believe the media is accountable for the stories published. Recently, two journalists were arrested on sexual harassment charges in Chennai. We didn’t defend them. So, the Raj Bhavan has to understand that the use of a draconian law is causing concerns about press freedom. And nothing more.” The Raj Bhavan does indeed seem to be missing this, and approaching the issue with different lenses. In fact, when N Ram of   appeared before the Magistrate defending Gopal, he was asked if such an article or photo would be published in his newspaper. Ram clearly stated he wouldn’t publish such a story without any evidence. So, the intention of journalists in Tamil Nadu is not to defend Gopal, but only to protest against the use of authority without justification. It obviously raises serious concerns about press freedom, which the journalists have to fight for. If only this issue was handled in a different manner, unnecessary spotlight on the respectable Governor’s office could have been avoided.",2018-10-13,"Governor banwarilal purohit,Rr gopal,Nakkheeran,Tamil nadu raj bhavan","Tamil Nadu Raj Bhavan slams media: Press freedom can’t be attacked over an article, even if 'defamatory'",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/raj-bhavan-governor-banwarilal-purohit-rr-gopal-nakkheeran-section-124-of-the-ipc/story/1/27208.html
144,Balbir Punj,"The world is full of questions to which no one seems to have answers. It defies all logic as to why Pakistan, a declared Islamic nation, is not only silent about the  , but is happily playing second fiddle to China. There are still more questions which beg for answers. The Indian communists actively worked for the creation of a theocratic Pakistan. They supplied Muhammad Ali Jinnah with all the intellectual arguments he needed to justify his demand for an Islamic nation. With such a divisive record on their report card, the Left has the gumption to define itself as touchstone of Indian ‘secularism’! After Independence, the communists refused to accept India as a free country. They also rejected the Constitution and waged an armed war against the state of India. It was the indomitable Sardar Patel who put paid to the ‘dream’ of Indian Left to turn democratic India into a communist dictatorship a la Red China and Soviet Union, identified with concentration camps, where millions of dissidents were left to rot and die. In spite of such a sordid past, the two terms, ‘left’ and ‘liberal’, an oxymoron in reality, are hyphenated in public discourse in India! Why? Maoists (an important component of the Left ‘parivar’) preach and practise violence. They are not only fighting an armed war against the state of India, but are also busy killing and maiming (in the most brutal manner) all those whom they chose to term as ‘class’ enemies. In most cases, their victims are poor tribals or low-paid government servants. They do not allow any development activities (building of roads, bridges, schools or hospital buildings) in their area of influence. And those who extend overt and covert help to such diabolical characters in their evil deeds are termed as ‘human rights activists’ by the media! Cut back to China. In this Communist country, out of the 141-crore population, Muslims account for 23 million — about two per cent. They are mostly concentrated in two provinces, namely Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR). Media is full of reports of atrocities by the Chinese regime on the hapless Muslims with a view to obliterate their Islamic identity. Over one million Uygur Muslims are locked in horrific‘re-education’ camps, also known as “transformation through education centres.” Thousands of children who are locked up in these camps with their parents are now sent to orphanages. One can understand Chinese regime’s crackdown on its citizens. It is in line with the communist ideology which has zero respect for human rights and dignity. But why is Pakistan silent on the issue? Pakistan claims to be a champion of all Islamic causes and justifies its proxy war against India as a part of its ‘divine’ duty to destroy its ‘kafir’ neighbour. But not only does Pakistan keep its eyes shut over what is happening to fellow Muslims in China, but has also ended up as its vassal state. Reports say Chinese authorities are also escalating a ‘crackdown’ on Christians. They burn Bibles, shut down churches, and force believers to sign papers denouncing their faith. The authorities have confiscated “illegal promotional materials,” amid a deepening crackdown on China’s ‘underground’ churches. During the last few decades of Chinese occupation, Tibet has nearly lost its identity. The proud independent nation, known for its unique brand of Buddhism, is now a Chinese colony.

146,Sushant Sareen,"The deed having been done, everyone is now bracing for what might follow. India went in   of the S400 missile system from Russia, knowing full well the possible implications of this deal – falling foul of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) passed by the US Congress. But even as many in India fear the worst – sanctions being imposed by the US on Indian entities under CAATSA – the hope is that the Trump administration will give India a waiver in order to keep the strategic relationship which has been blossoming for some time. But who can say for sure what US President Donald Trump will do? After all, if he could   to America’s European allies, and take on the  ,   and the  , end the years of US prevarication on  , then expecting him to show sensitivity to India’s flight of fancy of maintaining its ‘strategic autonomy’ is nothing more than a gamble. This became clear when on the sidelines of the 2+2 Dialogue, a top US official, when asked how the US President would react to the S400 deal, quipped that even he had no idea what Trump would do! While there is a lot to be said in favour of acquiring the S400 system for enhancing India’s security architecture and filling critical gaps in defence preparedness, conflating it with something as vague and nebulous as a concept like ‘strategic autonomy’ does not make much sense. If anything, such conflation only undercuts and undermines the security argument that India has made to the Americans to get a waiver from any sort of sanctions. In fact, India’s continuing dependence on Russia for many of its defence needs is in and of itself both evidence and argument on the non-existence of strategic autonomy. To put it differently, India’s dependence on Russian supplies circumscribe its claims to strategic autonomy. Cut through the clap-trap, and it becomes clear that for all the gravitas that it exudes, 'Strategic Autonomy' is nothing more than a slogan, more so for middle-level powers like India which depend on other Great Powers for weapon systems, political and diplomatic support, technology and markets. That even Great Powers have limits to their strategic autonomy is another matter. It is one thing to declare that Strategic Autonomy as a policy principle, and quite another to get taken in or fooled by your own rhetoric and grandstanding. Many principles of policy aren’t always implementable – or even sensible. Realpolitik demands that having once publicly declared a particular concept as a principle of policy – strategic autonomy in the current case – nation states should be wise and flexible enough to at least tweak, if not entirely ignore the principle to protect their national interests. It is patently foolish to let declared policy bind the country into a commitment trap. In other words, it is all very well for India to declare that it only adheres to multilateral sanctions under the aegis of the UN and doesn’t recognise unilateral sanctions imposed by any country on another country – but such a declaration of principle cannot be divorced from the reality that adhering to it will exact a very heavy price which is probably not worth paying. Clearly, India took a calculated risk by going ahead with the S400, despite the threat of CAATSA. Given the growing strategic convergence between the US and India, and the fact that Trump has been somewhat well disposed towards India, there is reasonable chance that he might agree to a waiver for India. To not do so would jeopardise the entire strategic partnership between the two countries. After India signed on two of the three ‘foundational agreements’ – LEMOA and COMCASA – imposing sanctions would mean tearing up these agreements. This is so because unlike some other countries, which have floated Special Purpose Vehicles to evade the CAATSA, in India’s case, the S400 is being procured for the Indian Air Force. If either the IAF or the Ministry of Defence in India was to now become a sanctioned entity, it would sound the death knell for the strategic relationship between the US and India. But having taken the risk entailed in a difficult decision to buy the S400, the chest-thumping on establishing India’s strategic autonomy was quite unnecessary – even less so considering the fact that after the deal was signed, there were a spate of reports about how India was working overtime to placate the Americans and even thinking of some big-ticket purchases from the US to humour Trump. If indeed India was so sure about not compromising on its strategic autonomy, then instead of trying to appease the Americans, India would be quite nonchalant about how the Trump administration would react. Perhaps the grandstanding was done with an eye on domestic politics, to prove to the people of India that the current dispensation will not succumb to pressure and will stand up for India’s right and take the decisions it feels are in the country's best interest. But this could have been done without blowing the trumpet of strategic autonomy, which is a bit fictional. Take, for instance, the   that India will continue to buy oil from Iran, defying the US sanctions. Coming as it did soon after the S400 deal, this statement was like throwing fuel on fire. Not only was it a diplomatic blooper, it was also economical with the facts on ground. The truth is that India is hoping for a waiver on zero oil from Iran. But if the waiver doesn’t come – there are some analysts who believe that the US might give a waiver on S400 but will not on Iran oil – then whether or not India likes it, there is going to be no oil that it will buy from Iran. Even if any petroleum company was willing to cock a snook at the US, it will still find it difficult to buy the oil because of the transactional, logistical, financial and other difficulties that will hinder oil trade with Iran. Clearly, it makes no sense for the government of India to put its entire economic stability on the line for the sake of maintaining the myth of strategic autonomy. While India can keep mouthing the mantra of multipolarity and other diplomatic mumbo-jumbo like strategic autonomy, it is important that it weighs the economic, strategic, political and diplomatic content of its relationship with the US against its relationship with Iran or Russia or any other country. On virtually every single parameter, the other relationships just don’t stack up to India's relationship with the US. Instead of nostalgia, realism and national interest must guide India's foreign policy.",2018-10-10,"S-400,Pakistan,Indo-US Tie,Foreign policy",India's grandstanding on 'strategic autonomy',https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-us-relations-iran-oil-pakistan-russia-foreign-policy-donald-trump/story/1/27161.html
147,DailyO,"So far, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for ""cooperative federalism"" was a commitment shown in public that has not been realised through action and outcome. Under his leadership, his party, the  BJP, is forced to pursue a polity without an inclusive outlook. Precisely, all that was said was not done. Of late, Niti Aayog is holding the baton to seek a bottom up development through its  . The programme aims to quickly and effectively transform the selected districts. The broad contours of the programme are convergence (of Central & State Schemes), collaboration (of Central, State level 'Prabhari' Officers & District Collectors), and competition among districts driven by a mass movement. With States as the main drivers, this program will focus on the strength of each district, identify low-hanging fruits for immediate improvement, measure progress, and rank districts. With setting aside the ""competition element among districts"", the programme offers little room for any major reform in the rural development programmes already on ground through Panchayats and Municipal Bodies in India. Also, in keeping such a restricted view on decentralised development, the grand irony gets deeper when the slogan like ""competitive federalism"" still comes out at times. If we think on the same in the case of Nepal, it is unlikely that a top down driven development paradigm comprising national planning, state enterprises, labour unions will allow inclusion of all and   This can only happen when opportunities are created for all by supporting markets garnished by agrarian, economic, financial, administrative and labour reforms — and not through just offering ""Seven State Governments under Federalism"". Not the least, maximising a bottom up development paradigm with maximum scope for local leadership development and culture specific innovations to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) depend much on the locals themselves in tune with their own capacity to deliver. Inclusive Growth must mean growth with productive employment by creating opportunities for jobs and by investing in one's human capital development of oneself and family members for the jobs. Planning must be macro, meso and micro, all harmonised strategically. The macro plan must project the desired structure of the economy for the next 25 years and the five year plan must be a human resource development plan that addresses the human capital requirements for the perspective economy of the future based on manpower supply and demand projections and plans judiciously integrated with the educational plan that opens avenues for vocational, apprenticeship, technical and technological for the variety of occupations in the national economy and in the global labour markets. In other words, the State will have 5 Five Year Rolling Macro Plans that will be supplemented by Meso Plans to strategically manage education, health, gender, children, youth, old age, disabled, castes and creeds, urbanisation, water, energy, ICT, transportation, investment, saving, capital markets, credit flows, exports, imports, taxation, and also corporate governance, entrepreneurship development, R&D; S&T, and monopoly regulation, for example, depending on the number of ministries. The fewer the Ministries the better. And Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Social Entrepreneurs are vital actors in the formulation and execution of the national and sector plans, as well as the creation of urban clusters and supply chains. Inclusive growth requires that we take in a host of factors and forces like geography, demography, social factors and forces, governance etc. and hence has to be participative to require decisions at all levels and all actors - not just the state guided by the National Planning Commission (NPC) with its very weak basic and applied research capacities coupled with rapid turnover of planners with the political changes. What is now needed is the framework of an Integrated Sector Programming and National Performance Budget governed by a sound Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRMBA) as exists in India, for example, where outcomes are underscored rather than simply inputs and outputs. Nepal's development plan has to be framed in the perspective of the opportunities from India, China and Bangladesh in due cognisance of its economic structure and development constraints. It requires the policy planners and business from both public and private sectors to be proactively engaged in national and sector dialogues with each other — to set down targets and outcomes for coordinated policy and designing of sector and multi-sector programmes aligned with the annual performance budgets. Also, the feasible economic growth targets have to be assessed for each 5-year periods first and foremost in consensus with the political parties — and not be driven by external agents and fanciful notions of the political leadership who are very weak in their understanding of economics and finance. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and sector targets should be set in a realistic manner and accordingly the action should take place to secure the best possible outcome. Each target must be supported by country wide action plan and programme. This requires development of both import substitution and export promotion strategies in partnership with the private sector to include targeting massive inward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to compensate for low gross household savings. This requires a new foreign exchange regime where all commodities are put in a common basket and the foreign exchange rate derived accordingly - and further, the devaluation of Nepali Rupee to protect the interests of local agriculture production against the subsidised exports. Subsidies to farmers is a sort of necessity with a national drive on irrigation infrastructure. Yes, costs have been borne at the household and individual levels with the pain and suffering of international migration and debts incurred for it. However, one can take advantage from the challenges by planning the remittance economy better so as to empower women as head of household and the girl child with the skills to fill in the job vacancies as happened during WWI and WW II that liberated women once and for all in the West. Finally, given all the above parameters and their variables for inclusion there was really no need for an ethnicity-based Inclusive State to render justice to all and the next generations. Yes, Nepal needs an Inclusive Constitution, to not exclude or discriminate against anyone. Primarily, to ensure the supremacy and the rule of law by having independent institutions to check abuse of political authority and guarantee accountability, transparency, competition and merit in the body politic for public good.

148,Hilal Ahmed,"Indian Islam, or at least, its popular representation, is always characterised by two key elements — a mosque with a minaret, and a congregation offering namaz. This iconic representation of Islamic religiosity is so powerful that we cannot think of Islam/Muslims without it. However, the relationship between a mosque and the act of performing namaz inside it has been an unresolved issue, contributing to a number of political debates in postcolonial India. The  in the Dr Ismail Faruqui case (also known as the Ayodhya case 1994) is a very relevant example of this mosque-namaz dichotomy.  While justifying the acquisition of a 2.77-acre plot of land in Ayodhya (including the site where the Babri Masjid once stood) by the state, the Supreme Court  between the ‘practice’ (namaz) and the ‘place’ (mosque). Evoking the established legal doctrine that the practices and elements of religion may be divided into “essential and non-essential practices”, it is argued that while namaz is an essential practice of Islam, the mosque as a place of worship does not have any special status. The : “Under the Mahomedan Law applicable in India……there can be no reason to hold that a mosque has a unique or special status… A mosque is not an essential part of the practice of the religion of Islam and namaz (prayer) by Muslims can be offered anywhere, even in open.” There is no debate on the fact that the Quran does not instruct Muslims to offer namaz only inside a mosque space. For this reason, performing namaz (individually as well as collectively) in the open is religiously valid, and legally justifiable. But the manner in which the Supreme Court describes the mosque as an unessential entity makes its status a highly contentious issue. Three conflicting sets of arguments are often made with regard to the status of the mosque. Although they revolve around the Babri Masjid dispute, a few broad observations are made on the complex relationship between the namaz and mosques. The Islamic religious elite, especially the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), takes a   on this: “Once a mosque, always a mosque”. It means if a plot of land is purchased and dedicated in the name of Allah as wakf to build a mosque  it would acquire a religiously sacred status, which cannot be taken away. In other words, the site as well as the structure of a mosque — even if there is no one to perform namaz inside it — enjoys special religious status. Therefore, a mosque cannot be changed, destroyed or shifted. This argument invokes the doctrine of “essential practice” very differently, for making a case for an independent and revered standing of a mosque.   The 19 questions submitted to the All India Babri Masjid Movement Coordination Committee (AIBMMCC) by the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), during the various rounds of negotiations in the 1990s, introduce us to the second set of arguments. The VHP   questions: These questions could not lead to meaningful negotiations on the Babri Masjid–Ram Temple dispute. Yet, an interesting position on the status of mosques evolved out of the VHP’s stand. Invoking an alternative reading of Islamic religiosity, the VHP emphasised the fact that even the Prophet was concerned about the legitimate status of a mosque. That was the reason he did not approve of offering of namaz in mosques that were built deceitfully. By this logic, the VHP seems to uphold the centrality of namaz as an essential practice, and the legitimate sacredness of all other mosques, except the ones such as the Babri Masjid. The  , on offering Friday congregational namaz on roads or on vacant plots, especially in Haryana, has produced another set of arguments. In a series of events, Muslims were forced to stop offering congregational prayers on vacant plots in various parts of Haryana. This anti-namaz move was led by various unknown local Hindutva organisations. Responding to the debate, the Chief Minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar,   although law and order should always be given priority, “there has been an increase in offering namaz in the open”, and that “namaz should be read in mosques or idgahs rather than public spaces”. 
 
 One cannot deny the element of Hindutva in this statement. However, the argument Khattar makes underlines an interesting position. He seems to suggest that namaz as an essential practice should always be performed inside a designated space, built essentially for this purpose. Although this claim goes against the Supreme Court verdict in the Ismail Faruqui case, Khattar’s statement indirectly strengthens the argument that namaz and the mosque space are equally sacred, and might well be included in the “essential practice” of Islam's criterion. Interestingly, despite offering very different conclusions, these contradictory positions on the status of the mosque are highly text-centric. It is assumed that Islamic religious texts — the verses of the Quran, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad — determine the nature of Muslim religious practices, as well as the status of mosques. As a result, namaz and mosque debates eventually take a communal overtone. Unfortunately, there is simply no space for appreciating namaz as a cultural practice, and a mosque as an essential part of a built environment, which is shared by practising Muslims — as well as those whose identities are formed through these cultural markers.",2018-10-08,"Islam,Namaz in mosque,Ismail faruqui case,Ayodhya verdict","Do Muslims need mosques to offer namaz: How the VHP, and a BJP chief minister, helped shape this debate",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-ayodhya-verdict-ismail-faruqui-case-mosque-namaz-essential-practice-islam/story/1/27127.html
149,Kanwal Sibal,"That India and Russia held their 19th annual summit last week testifies to the highest level attention that both countries give to their bilateral relationship. For Russia, the relationship with India is not the most important and for India, ties with Russia are not uppermost in foreign policy priorities. Yet, the annual summits have been held without break, which is exceptional. This suggests that for Russia, the bilateral relationship is worth nurturing because, apart from direct bilateral benefits, it gives to Russian foreign policy a strong Asian dimension. The esteem that the Indian leadership shows for President Vladimir Putin contrasts with his demonisation by the West. For India, a strong relationship with Russia is important for maintaining a balance in the country’s foreign policy. With the transformation of India-US relations and defence becoming a major pillar of their strategic partnership, maintaining a high level of understanding with Russia has become even more important. Our ties with Russia are multi-pronged and consist of formats such as the Russia-India-China dialogue, BRICS and SCO in which the West is absent. At a time when the global situation has become uncertain on all fronts, an atmosphere of Cold War is re-emerging and Russia and China have been designated by the US as its strategic adversaries, it is important for India to not be pulled in a direction that limits its diplomatic options. India has to maintain an appropriate level of engagement with all major powers to mark its commitment to multilateralism that is currently under siege. The just-concluded 19th summit has demonstrated that India will pursue its ties with Russia in the light of its national interest and will not dilute them under external pressures of the moment. For this reason, attention was focused on whether India would go ahead and sign the S-400 contract despite the threat of sanctions under America’s CAATSA legislation. The Modi government has shown courage and self-respect by concluding the S400 contract, though it has chosen to give it minimum projection by referring to it very laconically in the joint statement and excluding it from the list of agreements signed by the two sides in the presence of the two leaders. If negotiations for the Ka226 helicopter contract had reportedly reached an advanced stage, it might have been politic to have signed the contract now rather than later because this too is a “significant transaction” that comes within the purview of CAATSA and would require a US presidential waiver eventually. One should not expect each summit to produce eye-catching outcomes. The summits should be seen as stock-taking of ties, maintaining a forward momentum in the relationship, removing bottle-necks where necessary and laying the groundwork for future growth. In this context, the joint statement mentions the informal summit in Sochi in May this year as “reflecting the deep trust and confidence between Prime Minister Modi and President Putin” and an agreement to continue the practice. Trade remains a persistent weak point in India-Russia relations and unless trade exchanges are expanded bilateral ties will lack an all-around solidity. Bilateral trade increased by 20 per cent in 2017, crossing $10 billion, but this figure is by no means impressive. The goal of two-way investment of $30 billion by 2025 has, according to the joint statement, become an achievable target. Most of this investment is in the energy sector, which is an area of considerable potential. According to our Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas Russia is today our prime destination for investments in the hydrocarbon sector. Four Focus Sectors: Energy, Digital Economy, Startup and Infrastructure have been identified for cooperation. Support to promoting bilateral trade in national currencies has been reiterated in the joint statement, and this is important because of US sanctions on Russia. The proposed trilateral meeting between India, Russia and Iran in Moscow for the development of the International North-South Transport Corridor, signing of new long-term contracts for rough diamond supplies to Indian companies, additional cooperation in outer space (Russian cooperation in the Gaganyaan project), progress in bilateral civil nuclear cooperation and trilateral cooperation involving Bangladesh, continuation of military exercises involving the three services figure in the joint statement. On Afghanistan, the joint statement excludes any mention of negotiations with the Taliban, an issue on which the two sides differ, though the existence of external safe havens and sanctuaries (an allusion to Pakistan) is mentioned. The Iranian nuclear deal is supported with a call “for all issues related to the Iranian nuclear programme to be resolved peacefully and through dialogue” (allusion to US threats to Iran). On terrorism, while avoiding any mention of Mumbai, Uri or Pathankot attacks or naming jihadi organisations in Pakistan targeting India (consistent with Russian reticence on the subject), there is condemnation of “all kinds of state support to terrorists including cross-border terrorism” (another allusion to Pakistan). India has agreed with Russia in opposing the “imposition of unilateral coercive measures not based on international law” which is a veiled reference to US/EU sanctions on Russia. A little surprisingly, India has yielded to Russia’s support for China on the issue of a Regional Security Architecture “in the regions of Pacific and Indian Oceans” (not IndoPacific), with an emphasis that all new initiatives (the Indo-Pacific concept) are based on multilateralism and are “not directed against any country”.

150,Kamal Mitra Chenoy,"Since 2013 and 2015, the murders of the rationalist   and Leftist activist   in Maharashtra have left both people and the police shocked. On August 30, 2015, Kannada scholar and writer   was shot outside his home in North Karnataka. He was allegedly killed for a   he made in June 2014, where he, it was claimed, quoted Jnanpith awardee UR Ananthamurthy, and also apparently said that urinating on idols would not attract divine retribution. Incidentally, all three were killed by 7.65mm country-made pistols. According to sources, Ganesh Miskin (27), one of two suspects arrested by the Karnataka Police CID for Kalburgi’s murder, said that the 77-year-old scholar’s statement, made during a discussion on an Anti-Superstition Bill, was perceived as “anti-Hindu,” and triggered the attack on him. Miskin and Amit Baddi (28), both linked to a radical Hindu outfit, were arrested by the CID on September 15, after a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Karnataka Police probing the September 5, 2017 murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh (55 years) indicated their possible involvement in the Kalburgi case. Both youths are from the Hubli-Dharwad twin city region in North Karnataka. They were earlier named among 16 people linked to radical Hindutva outfits from Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka, who were arrested by the SIT in the Gauri Lankesh case. Both have a criminal record for involvement in communal violence in the Hubli area. Earlier, it was also discovered that the Sanatan Sanstha and the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS) — both highly communal — allegedly planned and executed the murder of Gauri Lankesh reportedly in Bangalore. Following  ’s murder last year, forensic analysis of the cartridges and bullets revealed that one 7.65 mm country-made pistol was used in both the Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh murders. In July this year, both Miskin and Baddi were arrested by the SIT probing the Gauri Lankesh case, after investigations revealed that they were reportedly part of a group of Hindu activists — many were linked to the Sanatan Sanstha and its affiliate, Hindu Janajagruti — who allegedly planned and executed the murder of the journalist in Bangalore. Miskin, who worked in an incense manufacturing firm in Hubli, was accused of taking Gauri Lankesh’s shooter to her house on a motorcycle, while Baddi, who worked as a goldsmith, has been accused of facilitating the getaway after the murder. In August 2018, the SIT, in a report to the CID, indicated the likely role of Baddi and Miskin in the Kalburgi case — including the possibility of one of them being the shooter. The SIT also indicated that a former HJS activist, Amol Kale (37), who allegedly recruited the two youths among several others and provided arms training, was also possibly involved in the murder. Some of the suspects arrested in the Gauri Lankesh case had earlier indicated that the journalist was targeted for her alleged “anti-Hindu” statements — including a 2012   in Mangalore, which was re-circulated on social media, in which she said that Hinduism has no specific parentage and is merely an arrangement of social structure. Following the 2012 speech, a resident of Mangalore had filed a case against Lankesh for hurting religious sentiments. According to sources, a video of her speech was found on a computer in the possession of a suspect, Sujeet Kumar (38), a former activist affiliated with the Hindu Janajagruti, who was also arrested for the journalist’s murder. The video was shown to youths allegedly recruited by the outfit to execute the murder. But what is troubling is the lack of a sustained attempt by the Maharashtra police and government to find the killers of Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare. There are Hindutva groups in Maharashtra similar to the HJS and Sanatan Sanstha, which could have had a role in the rationalists’ killings. The Maharashtra police SIT was granted custody of Amol Kale (37), Ganesh Miskin (27) and Amit Baddi (28) to investigate their alleged role in the shooting of Govind Pansare. The Maharashtra SIT concurred with the Karnataka SIT, that one of the two 7.65mm country-made pistols used to shoot the Pansares — Govind succumbed to the wounds, but his wife Uma survived — was supposedly used in the murders of Kalburgi and Lankesh. This further exposes the widespread operations by Hindutva organisations to severely censure, if not kill, rationalists and secularists who have challenged saffron ideologies and movements which attack secularism and Constitutional rights.",2018-10-07,"MM Kalburgi,Govind Pansare,Gauri Lankesh,Rationalists",The mysterious case of murdered rationalists and their missing killers,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/killed-rationalists-mm-kalburgi-govind-pansare-narendra-dabholkar-gauri-lankesh-hindutva/story/1/27103.html
151,Aman Singh,"Market research and customer satisfaction surveys are two sides of the same coin — you ask them what they want and then check if they are happy with what you gave them. About market research, however, Steve Jobs famously said, “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them”. Henry Ford is also reputed to have said, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!’.” But customer satisfaction is another matter altogether. Almost any brand worth its salt has an elaborate customer satisfaction measurement process. Customer satisfaction survey is arguably the most important activity in virtually every large or small corporation selling product or service — the scores being reported to the very top regularly. Tomes of management research exist on the subject and the field has its own set of TLAs (three letter acronyms) like CSI and NPS. The government is an exception. If you are too scared to ask your customers their feedback, then you are probably certain it will bring bad news. This is probably why most governments do not dare do it and continue to remain ensconced in their cozy echo chambers! Of course, most governments around the world do not really see themselves as service providers or citizens as consumers. Not yet, at any rate. Lip service is as far as most get during election promise time. If they did, phrases like anti-incumbency would not be bandied about so nonchalantly in prime-time TV debates. While there is sufficient interest among researchers to study citizen satisfaction, not many governments (besides a few local city governments in Canada and the US) have actually put this to practice. That is why Chhattisgarh government’s initiative, Jan Samvaad, to do exactly that, has broken new ground. Several state governments have a helpline number for citizens to call in and register complaints. But lack of faith in call centres is sufficient to discourage the majority from calling. Most governments rely on the feedback from government machinery which obviously suffers from the Rashomon Effect. And we have seen non-scalable models in Amar Chitra Katha about kings walking the streets in disguise to gauge the happiness of subjects. When technology is used and the law of large numbers kicks in, biases just melt away. Jan Samvaad is a proactive mechanism to seek citizens’ feedback on services delivered under various state and central schemes. A team of 250 outbound callers speaks with citizens. A structured questionnaire is used as a basis for guiding the conversation through several aspects of service delivery quality for eight key schemes to draw genuine and candid feedback. And this is done not by government employees but by an independent third party so citizens can talk without fear or bias. Technological advances in computing power and fast plummeting costs of data collection and storage have well-nigh obviated the need for sampling. Big data has sounded the death knell for the law of small numbers. The government now knows not just whether there are isolated area-specific challenges in service delivery so those can be ironed out, but also if there are specific process components that need modification. It knows whether getting the service takes too long in certain Gram Panchayats or Blocks or even whether the citizens do not see much value in some scheme or initiative. Amazing practical suggestions and polychromatic feedback have been received — some reinforcing the existing perceptions but many also shattering beliefs and turning upside down notions which were held as gospel. Most have been incorporated into improving the schemes. With more than 100 crore mobile phone subscribers in India already, of which 48 crore have access to mobile Internet (nearly 30 crore of those are rural), what is already possible through calls and government mobile apps is massive. And it costs next to nothing compared to the cost of media carpet bombing for publicity. The confluence of technologies has set up a historic opportunity for governments to understand and seek feedback from citizens at an individual level. However, even though communication technology and big data are necessary, they alone are not sufficient. Other essential ingredients include citizen-first strategy, data-driven culture, the desire to know the outside-in view, the courage to accept the feedback and an innate drive to improve coupled with visionary leadership.

152,Shantanu Mukharji,"Relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia — already under severe strain — have taken more beating after leading Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi’s death, who is suspected to have been murdered inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi (59) was last seen entering the Consulate on Tuesday. His disappearance caused a huge flutter and Turkish establishment was   to find out Khashoggi’s whereabouts. According to  , it is their strong assessment that not only was the murder premeditated, Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents and his “dead body” was later mysteriously removed. The whole case looks like an Agatha Christie mystery — one that is, however, going to kick up a diplomatic row further impairing relations between Riyadh and Ankara. The alleged murder, cloaked in deep mystery, assumes more global significance because Khashoggi was a high-profile journalist with penetrating international connections. Khashoggi had   to the US on October 2, 2017, fearing trouble (or even harm) from Saudi authorities — at the behest of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) — for having remained a strong voice of dissent, always vociferous in castigating the Saudi government for its anti-people policies, severe Wahhabism, persecution of Houthis in Yemen, economic blockade of Qatar and myriad other problems. The alleged murder has now provided the Turkish government with readymade fodder on a silver platter, who, in all likelihood, would exploit it to the hilt for its political advantages. It is well-known that Turkey and Saudi Arabia have, of late, been involved in a fierce   to gain supremacy in the Middle East and Gulf region. President Erdoğan of Turkey has left no stone unturned to expose Saudi Arabia for the “murder most foul” to assert Turkey’s supremacy in the region. Against this backdrop, the   in Ankara was summarily summoned by the Turkish Foreign Ministry on October 4, post the disappearance of Khashoggi. Simultaneously, the Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi (Erdoğan’s party) spokesperson Ömer Çelik came down heavily on Riyadh on the murder issue. Interestingly, it is now said that a 15-member Saudi delegation had come to Turkey recently and the delegates also comprised, among others, diplomats and security or intelligence contingent. It is suspected that the “murder” was possibly the handiwork of Saudi agents, and that the operation was conducted in order to silence Khashoggi. On its part, Riyadh has told Turkey to undertake vigorous investigations to unearth the case and may even search the Consulate premises for incriminating evidence. The plot thickens. A question worth asking is what brought Khashoggi to Istanbul? Knowledgeable sources say that he had come to collect some documents from the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul with regard to his   to a Turkish woman called Hatice Cengiz, who disclosed that she was waiting outside the Consulate but Khashoggi never came out. While the Turkish authorities seem confident in their assessment that Khashoggi was indeed murdered, the US administration, while exercising abundant discretion and caution, has said that they are monitoring the developments in Turkey and are yet, not in a position to confirm the death. Khashoggi, at the time of his disappearance, was working for the   and writing almost regularly under the “Global Opinion” column. Other than his journalistic commitments, he had always occupied key positions and was the editor-in-chief of   and other vociferous media outlets including  , known for airing progressive views. He was closely connected with the Saudi Intelligence as well. His firsthand knowledge of the region and nexus with all kinds of people wielding authority made him suitable to be handpicked in an advisory capacity for the Saudi intelligence and he regularly advised the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Turki al Faisal on sensitive matters. Prince Turki later became the Saudi Ambassador to the UK and the US, exposing Khashoggi to numerous roles of critical importance. His stated commitments apart, his services were duly appropriated more than once in meeting Al Qaeda supremo, Osama bin Laden even when he was in hiding in Tora Bora in Afghanistan and once in Sudan. Khashoggi had even interviewed   and once tried to convince him to abandon the path of terrorism. Such was the access and charisma of the slain journalist. As far as optics go, this case has exposed MBS as ruthless tyrant, who in the recent past, has tried to stifle voices of dissent of several human rights activists, journalists and his tough measures including crackdown on those elements perceived to be anti Saudi regime. Khashoggi is believed to be one of the targets. MBS critics are saying that now the Royal Kingdom is now seen worse than a Zionist terror state. However, it is unlikely that he would tone down his actions; instead the state would be further emboldened by the attempts to eliminate Khasshogi to send a strong signal to those opposed to MBS and his designs. It is, perhaps, possible that MBS is labouring under a sense of extreme superiority thanks to his connections with the US. It is also possible that MBS has struck a new tie-up with the Israeli secret service — this operation in Istanbul has the footprints of high-calibre professionalism seen in the cases of unseen hands eliminating their opposition with silence and finesse. Saudis are, perhaps, trying to perfect their excellence in furtherance of their plans and the world must expect more covert operations by Saudi Arabia in a not-so-distant future with Iran as its primary target. An alumnus of the Indiana University, Khashoggi would have turned 60 on the 13th of this month. His exit from the media world and alleged murder, of all places in Istanbul, would see further deterioration of the Saudi-Turkish ties, especially in the light of Iran trying to woo Turkey to alienate Saudi Arabia to secure its geopolitical interests.",2018-10-07,"Erdogan,Saudi Arabia,Turkey,Jamal khashoggi",The mysterious ‘killing’ of top Saudi journalist and what it means for the Middle-East,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-turkey-istanbul-erdogan-ankara-riyadh-washington-post/story/1/27106.html
153,Sushant Sareen,"The tentative moves to establish some sort of contact with the new civilian dispensation in Islamabad and perhaps also re-engage at some level with the Pakistanis have expectedly enough come crashing down on the rocks of reality. The verbal fusillades that have been fired by both sides against each other, including at the UN where Pakistan continued to suffer its ""annual itch"" (to use the evocative phrase of a former Indian foreign secretary) have only added to the existing bitterness and malevolence in the bilateral relationship. For all practical purposes then, the prospects for any political engagement are almost non-existent for the foreseeable future, or at least until the 2019 general elections. But pinning hopes on 2019 might be a trifle over-optimistic because even if there is a change in government in Delhi, there will be no change in policy, much less paradigm, in Pakistan. This means that even if a political dialogue was to recommence, its trajectory will be no different from the desultory dialogues that have happened in the past. The entire lot of turn-the-other-cheek faux liberals in India are desperately hoping to see the back of the BJP/NDA government in 2019 because, among other things, they expect the next government to restart talks with Pakistan. But chances are that even a Modi-led government will once again roll the dice and reach out to Pakistan once the election is out of the way. The track record of successive Indian governments suggests that within a few months of cutting high-level contact with the Pakistanis, they start suffering from withdrawal symptoms. The incorrigible optimists, therefore, believe that given the propensity of Indian politicians to change policy with the changing seasons (not just meteorological but also of the election cycle variety), the two countries will be back on the table by around this time next year Unless of course, those pining for talks with Pakistan believe that holding talks is an end in itself and not a means to an end, they have to be utterly devoid of all grey matter if they think that talking to an unreconstructed, unreformed, unchanged, and therefore unreasonable and unyielding Pakistan will lead to even a modicum of normalisation in the bilateral relationship. But it isn’t only that Pakistan won’t change. There is also little chance of any major shift in policy in India regardless of who forms the next government in New Delhi. The Pakistan lobbyists in India are living in cloud cuckoo land if they think that a Congress-led or even a Third-Front-led dispensation will be ready to compromise on India’s vital national interests. At best there could be a change in style (softer, less aggressive, avoiding unnecessary chest thumping), but there will be no change in substance (defending the unity and territorial integrity of India and giving no quarter to jihadist terror groups). In other words, a non-BJP/NDA dispensation might be amenable to talks but is highly unlikely to alter India’s longstanding position on terrorism or any of the other issues/disputes, especially those of a sovereign nature. That those talks will be quite fruitless, if not entirely useless, is another matter. The pot-shots being taken by the Opposition against the Modi government over its Pakistan policy (is there even such a thing given the constant flip-flops of every government, or is it merely a knee-jerk, reactionary approach that is often mistaken for policy?) are no different from what the BJP did when it was in Opposition. This is nothing more than political point scoring aimed more at domestic audiences rather than indicative of some sort of a rethink over India’s stand on a host of issues involving Pakistan. For anyone to be enthused by this sort of political sniping and extrapolate this to imagine that today’s Opposition leaders will be tomorrow’s ""Gorbachev"" is nothing short of self-delusion. With India unlikely to budge from its stand and Pakistan showing not even the smallest sign of change in its jihad-infused perniciousness — neither Rahul Gandhi’s urbane charm nor the more earthy and even rustic wisdom and worldview of other contenders to the top political job in India is going to impress the Pakistanis enough to see the light of day — what we are looking effectively at is an unstoppable force (Pakistan) meeting an immovable object (India). One doesn’t need to be a genius to figure out that as long as this situation obtains, the prospects of a political dialogue between the two countries will remain extremely bleak. In any case, by this time next year, Imran Khan’s honeymoon period will be over and he will not have much wriggle room left to deal with India. The severe economic crisis that is confronting Pakistan will require painful adjustments which will in turn be accompanied by high level of economic distress which will take the shine off ""Naya Pakistan"" project. With the opposition smelling blood, the last thing Imran Khan or his patrons – Pakistan Army – can afford is an engagement with India.While it is possible that the Pakistanis might still come on the table, it will not be with any degree of seriousness, even less sincerity. In other words, the Pakistanis will keep doing what they are doing — hostile propaganda, inciting and instigating violence against India, exporting jihadist terror — which will then mean that sooner rather than later the dialogue will derail once again. Given the immutable reality of the India Pakistan equation, India would be better served if instead of wasting time and energy in making meaningless gestures and hankering after a dialogue with Pakistan, which will inevitably end no different from innumerable other such talk fests, it builds its capabilities to deter and deny, and if required punish Pakistan. More than anything else, it is this that will bring change in Pakistan, which in turn will make any talks with it the means to an end rather than an end in itself.

154,Amitabh Srivastava,"With the Lok Sabha elections just a few months away, two of the six Lok Janshakti Party MPs, Veena Devi Singh and Rama Kishore Singh, have already expressed dissatisfaction with the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) leadership – and at least one of them looks ready to contest as a rebel. The less said the better about the other saffron ally from Bihar, Upendra Kushwaha of Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) who has alternatively been blowing hot and blowing cold, keeping both the BJP and the RJD-led ""grand alliance""clueless about his future course of action. But amid all the squabbles within the NDA, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar looks unflustered and unhurried, as he sips his steaming cup of tea, sitting in the sprawling garden at 1 Anne Marg, his official residence in Patna. “All I can say at this moment is that we have reached an understanding with the BJP and a respectable seat distribution agreement has been agreed upon. A formal announcement would be made later,” the chief minister told  . Nitish hinted as much when he recently addressed the JD(U) state executive meet. He told his party men that a “respectable arrangement has been worked out and it would be announced soon.” Delaying a seat-sharing deal could be strategic as well since both BJP and JD(U) could also be waiting for another ally — Union minister Kushwaha’s RLSP, who has been sitting on the fence — to take a final view. Indeed, only two persons — BJP president Amit Shah and chief minister Kumar, also the JD(U) national president — seem to know the exact details of the NDA’s seat-sharing arrangement in Bihar for the Lok Sabha elections. In fact, by only holding alliance talks with Nitish Kumar — and not with LJP and RLSP, the other two saffron alliance partners from Bihar— BJP president Amit Shah has made it clear that Bihar chief minister was at the top of NDA’s pecking order in the state. Indeed, it speaks volume about Nitish’s capability, as he has completed over 4200 days in the chief minister’s office in a caste country like Bihar, not because he hails from a numerically insignificant caste group Kurmi with just about 3 per cent population, but despite it. BJP under Shah, which is acutely aware that the Modi wave of 2014 may not be repeated in 2019, is banking heavily on Nitish’s goodwill to deliver maximum seats from Bihar, where NDA won 31 seats in 2014. If Lalu Prasad’s solid support base of the Yadavs, the single largest caste group with 14 per cent of the population, does not seem much of a concern for Nitish, it is largely because the Bihar CM has similar consolidation of the Extremely Backward Castes (EBC) behind him. The EBC is a group of several castes that together constitute about 30 per cent of Bihar’s voters. The EBCs were nurtured seriously by Nitish when, in 2006, the JD(U)-BJP government reserved 20 per cent of panchayat seats for people from this segment of the population. Before then, the panchayats in Bihar were known as a fiefdom of the upper castes and dominant backward castes. The Nitish Kumar-led government’s move thus allowed the EBCs to become the centre of power at the panchayat level for the first time. No wonder the EBC group, cutting across castes, has always voted en bloc for Nitish in 2009 Lok Sabha and 2010 and 2015 Vidhan Sabha polls, handing him landslides in all these elections. The only deviation was the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, in which the EBC had voted for BJP ostensibly to make an Ati-Pichchda Prime Minister. The group, however, returned to Nitish in the 2015 assembly polls. Nitish’s strategy of giving political space to erstwhile marginalised groups, like EBC and Mahadalits has yielded him dividends. While those in the know of things about NDA’s seat-sharing arrangements are keeping cards close to their chests, some of the filtered conversations that have spilled over to the political corridors hint at a possibility of JD(U) and BJP likely to contest an almost equal number of seats for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

155,Shalini Lobo,"Thalapathy Vijay gave his fans exactly what they wanted on the night of the   — a power packed speech. Flags and T-shirts with the actors face on it was all one could see in the crowds and, of course, the applause and cheering echoed through the night. Was the applause for the actor or the politician in him? That is a question everyone is dying to have answered. Vijay, one of the highest paid Tamil actors, seems to be the next actor-neta in Tamil Nadu. While he had earlier spoken up on a few issues, his interest in politics came to the fore when he spoke up on the Jallikattu issue. Not only did he speak but also took part in the protests. He also visited the parents of Anita, who fought against the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in Supreme Court. Anita   over the NEET issue. But on October 2, at the audio launch, Vijay spoke politically at length. The actor   of corruption, leaders, elections and leaders working in the system efficiently. When asked what he would do if he became chief minister of the state by the host of the programme, Vijay replied, ""I will not act like a CM, I will do my job sincerely."" The actor spoke on how one has to bribe people to get even a birth or death certificate in today's age and time and blamed the people at top for what is happening in the country. ""Why do people at the bottom take money? It is because people at top take money. If a leader is right and just, so will the party be.” These statements did get the actor much applause and left his fans excited. But how much of an impact will Vijay make in Tamil politics? Sumanth Raman, a Chennai-based political analyst, said: ""Movie stars enter politics looking at MGR and Jayalalithaa's success. But I'm not sure if those examples are relevant today. Both MGR and Jayalalithaa put many years into politics before they came to power. No doubt Vijay has a sizable following but that alone is not enough to guarantee success,” said. Vijay isn't a lone wolf, actors Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth also launched their own political organisations. Haasan with his party, Makkal Needhi Maiam and Rajinikanth with Rajini Makkal Mandram. However, both still have a long way to cover before they attain the stature MGR or Jayalalithaa held. ""Having a large fan base will not guarantee Haasan or Rajini success in politics either. I believe the same is the case for Vijay. People still don't know his stance on various issues,” said Sumanth Raman. While Vijay may have taken a jibe at the Tamil Nadu chief minister from a public platform, Edappadi Palanisamy seems unfazed. ""It is a democratic space. He can start his political party and he is entitled to his opinion,” said the CM at Madurai in an address to the press. The DMK which is the principle Opposition party in the state also seems unperturbed. ""We welcome anyone who wants to try their hands in politics. Ultimately, it is up to the people to reward them. But just because they are stars they can't win polls. One needs to work for it,” said A Saravanan of the DMK. The reason political parties who would've otherwise seen big actors as competition seem relaxed can perhaps be attributed to the fact that the two superstars who made hugely hyped entries into the political arena have failed to gain much momentum. Kamal Haasan announced the adoption of eight villages at the beginning of the year but had adopted only one so far. He has attended two gram sabhas as an observer and felicitated women on International Women's Day. He launched  , an anti-corruption app. But what has Haasan really done to stand out for the masses? While he is loved and respected for his contribution to the world of cinema, he hasn't really hit a political chord yet with the people. The same holds true for his counterpart Rajinikanth. While Haasan has   and   in the pipeline after which he is will retire as an actor, Rajinikanth is signing on more movies. He announced his political entry on December 31, 2017, but until now a political party as such hasn't been announced by Thalaiva much to the disappointment of his fans. ""We have to see if Vijay enters actual politics or if this a statement just ahead of his movie launch. Even Rajinikanth said he is entering politics but until now only ground work is happening,” said CR Saraswathi, AMMK leader. While Kamal Hassan has met many leaders through the year, he still has not joined hands with anyone. Speculation is rife over Rajini and the BJP joining hands. Even BJP chief   Rajini into the field. This view was also supported by BJP minister Pon Radhakrishnan, ""Everyone cannot be MGR nor can they be Jayalalithaa. Only Rajinikanth is influential as an actor. I don’t know if Rajinikanth is actually supporting the BJP because he hasn’t started his party. People have a good opinion of him as he is a good actor and a nice person. They feel he might do good for the people."" However, he did not take actor Vijay's statements on corruption in the system lightly. ""People shouldn't enter politics in TN citing a vacuum in the state. If he wants to completely focus on politics then there is nothing wrong in it. He is complaining that people are inefficient and receiving bribes. Let him openly name people accepting bribes and I will garland him if he does so,”   Union minister of state for finance and shipping Pon Radhakrishnan. Politics and the acting industry in Tamil Nadu have always gone hand in hand. CN Annadurai, MGR, M Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa all started from the world of cinema and then moved on to politics. While it worked for them, it need not be the perfect success formula. Some rise and some fall, and after Haasan and Rajini, all eyes are now glued to Vijay's next move.",2018-10-05,"Rajinikanth,Kamal Haasan,Sarkar,Thalapathy vijay",Why speculation over superstar Vijay joining Tamil Nadu politics is rising,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/thalapathy-vijay-sarkar-kamal-haasan-rajinikanth-amit-shah-tamil-nadu-politics/story/1/27072.html
156,Aroon Purie,"This has been a landmark year for women breaking into traditional male bastions. In February, an IAF pilot became the first Indian woman to fly a fighter jet solo and just three months later, in May, a six-member Indian Navy crew became the first Indian women to circumnavigate the globe. Their unique achievements go down in the hall of fame for a country that already has more women commercial pilots than any other, and where women who are successful politicians, sport stars and CEOs now don't attract a second look. But there is one glass ceiling that keeps women out — religion. The doors of a large number of shrines are still closed to women. This bastion too is now being challenged. On September 28, the   paved the way for women of all ages to enter the Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala, Kerala. Four of the five judges on the constitution bench said the temple ban violated the fundamental rights of Hindu women. These entry barriers are really a metaphor for what is essentially a settled patriarchal and male-dominated religious order, which has continued unchallenged for centuries. Patriarchy, or the power of men over women, continues into the religious spaces when it denies agency or autonomy to women. In Hinduism, male gods are incomplete without their female consorts. But women are deemed unclean when they menstruate and, hence, kept out of kitchens and temples like Sabarimala. In different ways, the practices of every major global religion reflect an inherent patriarchy. The clergy are largely a men-only club. This is why the Supreme Court verdict on September 28 is ground-breaking, because it highlights the skewed relationship between women and religion. The judgment by the four Supreme Court justices recommends abandoning 'the dualism that persists in religion by glorifying and venerating women as goddesses on one hand and by imposing rigorous sanctions on the other in matters of devotion'. This is one in a series of enormously significant Supreme Court judgments upholding women's rights. Last August, the court held that   had no legal validity. Earlier this year, it ruled that the legitimacy of an adult woman's marriage by her choice could not be questioned. In another landmark judgment, it upheld the right of daughters to claim an equal share in their ancestral property. Our cover story, 'Sexist Gods', looks at why men still call the shots in all of India's religions and why religion discriminates against women. Our galaxy of guest writers who have closely looked at this peculiar religious patriarchy — authors Pavan K Varma and Devdutt Pattanaik, the historian Uma Chakravarti, literary historian Rakhshanda Jalil, lawyer Flavia Agnes and women's rights activist Syeda Hameed - explain why it is now untenable. We also have profiles of women who have swum against the religious tide. Mahant Devyagiri of Lucknow's Mahakameshwar temple, the only woman head priest of a major Hindu temple. Noorjehan Safia Niaz of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, who got the court to allow women to visit the inner sanctum of Mumbai's Haji Ali dargah, and Gulrukh Contractor Gupta, who is fighting for equal rights for Zoroastrian women. I believe if religion is to remain relevant, it has to keep up with the times. The various faiths must reflect the society where they are practised while adhering to their core beliefs. Women's emancipation and gender equality has been a movement for over a century and still continues. Women form half our population and cannot in today's age be denied their fundamental freedoms. Most importantly, they should have the freedom to choose. After all, if women can fly fighter jets, surely they can be allowed the same access to places of worship as men, or even become priests. The world will be a better place for it.

157,Sandip Ghose,"In India of the seventies, two hands haunted public imagination. One was “ ” — the long arm of the law. The other was the ubiquitous “foreign hand”. Both were invisible and supposed to work in their own mysterious ways. The first — that of the law — though was easy to visualise, it was often elusive. Sometime prone to error, like getting hold of the wrong person, it was also inefficient. Yet, what it lacked by way of effectiveness, it compensated with a magical ability to stretch with time. So, it did manage to create an aura of fear. The “foreign hand” was more enigmatic. No one had ever seen it. Nor did one have any idea of how it worked or when it would strike. But everyone believed in its existence, somewhat like the Loch Ness Monster or the Himalayan Yeti. Most Bengalis suffer from a congenital ailment that they call “gas” (pronounced “gash”). It is akin to indigestion but more esoteric. Any unknown symptom is “gas”. That was the nature of the “foreign hand” as well. If something defied explanation in the political world, it must be the “foreign hand”. That was the era of the Cold War. India was then engaged in a socialist love affair. Indira Gandhi, who was the Prime Minister, made no secret of her affection for the Soviet Union. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States was anathema to her. Anything going off-track in the country’s governance was the doing of the CIA. “Foreign hand” was a euphemism. The spectre of the CIA’s omnipresence had gained such absurd proportions, it became a subject of satire in public discourse. I recall a play performed by Utpal Dutt's Left-leaning theatre group in Kolkata. It had a song “ ”. It parodied the CIA — Sia (CIA) knows everything. To be fair, Nixon’s displeasure with Indira Gandhi is well-known. American   in the 1971 Indo-Pak War and Bangladesh Liberation is not fiction. The USA was not pleased with Indira declaring Emergency either. Some say that the US may have nudged Indira Gandhi to lift the Emergency. Her biographers have written about her mortal fear of elimination by unseen enemies. The idea of the “foreign hand” was not a convenient bogey, raised by insecure politicians. It was not an excuse for things going wrong or not according to plan. It was also not paranoia. In the days of the “Cold War”, India was also the playground for foreign intelligence. Former RAW chief Vikram Sood has written about this in his book  . Recent declassified documents of foreign governments, Julian Assange and Edward Snowden corroborate Sood’s story. The CIA and the KGB had made deep inroads into the Indian establishment. Many politicians, bureaucrats, diplomats, police and intelligence officers were on their pay. Political parties received funding for elections from the US and the USSR. Even more interesting is the psychological warfare. The KGB   they had “ten Indian newspapers and a news agency on its payroll”. They put out stories through these outlets. As Sood mentions in  , Moscow planted over 160,000 items in the Third World Press in its heyday. In India, during 1972-75 alone, the KGB reportedly pushed 17,000 stories in the Indian media. If the KGB was this determined, it is safe to assume that the CIA would not have lagged behind. Sood writes about how the Americans have developed the use of aid agencies as intelligence arms to an art form. Cut to the present — there is little reason to believe that the foreign powers have lost interest in India. If anything, India’s importance has grown manifold in the global geopolitical sphere. India’s influence now extends far beyond its immediate neighbourhood. India’s military prowess and diplomatic weight have increased. From an effete “non-alignment”, India is today a significant voice in the non-Communist axis. It is also a major stakeholder in the global war against terror. This has to be seen with the rise of China and resurgence of Russia as a super-power under Putin. We are moving from an era of Cold War to an age of a “Colder War"". Now, cyber-missiles supplement traditional warheads. Data and social media are the new weapons of mass destruction. As people and country, we understand the compulsions of geopolitics. It calls for our discreet engagement in the political affairs of our neighbours. In fact, if there are developments that do not go as per our general liking, we tend to blame the government. We criticise our foreign office for not being able to predict or inspire the desired outcome. Pakistan is a chronic complainant of India's interference in its affairs. Those who have lived in other South Asian countries know how others are also wary of the “Indian hand”. Now, of course, there is the looming dragon. This makes India and China the new protagonists in the regional Cold War. We are quite open about discussing the US-China-Russia involvement in other countries. There are tomes written on how the United States changed regimes across the world. The CIA is not a taboo word when it comes to Pakistan, Afghanistan or Iran.  of Russians in the US election and Brexit are topics of serious debates. But we do not discuss the possibility of external players penetrating our national politics. We turn coy and put on blinkers, assuming that what we cannot see does not exist. In fact, we accuse those raising such questions of being conspiracy theorists. We say they are creating excuses for their inevitable defeat. This has been the pattern for decades. Here, we are being naïve as a nation. A cursory look at the   of Russian hackers in the US will be instructive. It will reveal how vulnerable we are to such misadventures. Even scarier still is the fact that our systems are not as secure as those of the Western world. Besides, electoral personnel on the ground are not equipped to detect such infiltration. Let us examine a few key elements of what happened in the United States, as per the investigators. First, there was a massive social media campaign to sow discord. It carried out “information warfare” to disrupt the 2016 presidential election and assist Trump’s candidacy. The scheme took years to execute. It cost millions of dollars and involved dozens of people. People travelled to the United States or organised political rallies on American soil. As early as the spring of 2014, a “ ” devised a strategy to spread distrust. This was towards the candidates and the political system in general. They used fraudulent bank accounts and other fake identity documents. The troll farm used Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. They created fake “bot” accounts and misleading advertising. Trolls produced materials intended to promote pro-Trump and anti-Clinton hashtags on Twitter — including #TrumpTrain, #MAGA and #Hillary4Prison. Trolls encouraged minority groups to either not vote or vote for third-party candidates. The Russians reportedly  party servers and emails, then published stolen files using outlets created by them. The timing of the releases was no accident. They seized on the “conflict” between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton before the Democratic National Convention. The hackers stole information on voters. They had names, addresses, social security numbers, birthdays and driver’s license numbers. The Russians reportedly also breached a company that sells voter registration software. They posed as employees to send fake messages to election administrators. Those emails contained malicious software. These indictments are scary. One shudders to think how exposed we are to such manipulations. One has to only sit back and reflect to see patterns in much that is happening around us. Yet, what is stunning is the silence of political parties and the media about such a potential threat. In the US, the intelligence agencies had alerted Obama. He, in turn, had picked up the phone and asked Putin to lay off. What purpose that served is another question, but there was at least action. Further, after the elections, a massive independent investigation has been undertaken. Also, safeguards are being put in place for the future. Some explain the reticence of politicians to the ""Glass House Syndrome"". For example, when we think of ""black money"", we automatically think: “S ”. The same will hold true for foreign funding. Political parties must have taken help from foreign benefactors in the past. So, they cannot afford to hurl stones or point fingers at the others. Sections of the media may be complicit — hence, they too won’t raise uncomfortable questions. Finally, it is for the people to ask and raise their concern if we are not to become a banana republic.

158,Gautam Benegal,"As a child growing up in Bengal with folk tales peopled with speaking birds, cats, tigers and foxes often running afoul of the law and getting hauled up in front of the king, one often came across words like, “Maharaj  ?” Translated, this means, “Oh Great King, should we speak fearfully or fearlessly?” The implication of this query obviously being that the former approach would be censored and pleasing to the ears. The latter would be the unmitigated truth that is likely to offend his majesty. Offending the king was sedition and never ended well. A common punishment in those days was making the offender sit on the finely honed point of a “shool”, a sharp lance, and the end was excruciatingly slow and painful. A wise and just king would usually respond to the question with a kindly, “Obhoy bolo” (Speak without fear). We too had been asked to speak our minds fearlessly and criticise the government, as that is essential in a healthy democracy. On April 18, Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the ' ' programme at London's Westminster Central Hall had said ""I want this government to be criticised. Criticism makes democracy strong. Democracy cannot succeed without constructive criticism.” However, he also added a caveat: “To criticise, one has to research and find proper facts. Sadly, it does not happen now. What happens instead is allegations."" Of course, one can never control what form such criticism may take because that would go against the very spirit of this generous assurance of safe passage of free speech and expression. Criticism may range from a reasoned article in an online publication pointing out the glaring disconnects of a  , to a meme of the PM smearing his own wax statue with the words “ "". It could manifest in a timid panelist trying to make a point on   being hollered down by Arnav Goswami (and labelled an “ ” for his views) or a standup comedian like  after a group of students wrote to the Vice-Chancellor alleging that his content was “anti-national.” The word “anti-national” has been increasingly gaining traction since 2014 ever since the BJP came to power, and it has now escalated to "" "".  If the allegation of being an anti-national was merely socially reprehensible but not legally admissible, sedition is an actual crime punishable by law and a serious matter. Since the charge of being an anti-national segues into charges of sedition very easily nowadays, one has cause to panic. So much so that recently, a  activists of his college and begging for their mercy, after they had called him by that dreaded word. According to anthropologist Alpa Shah, whose latest book,   where she attempts to bring some sanity into the discourse surrounding Naxalism and highlight the endemic structural violence that the Indian state has wreaked over decades in Jharkhand’s Adivasi areas, “branding people as ‘Urban Naxals’ sadly seems a way of discrediting and silencing those who have devoted their lives to the rights of the powerless”. . The villagers of Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu had sedition cases slapped against them for resisting a nuclear power project. It was  unique form of protest against this kind of buttonholing and stereotyping, by hanging a placard from his neck “Me Too Urban Naxal” that got him into trouble recently. We have reached the point where the government’s policies and dealings are considered sacrosanct and beyond scrutiny or critique because no distinction is made between party and government and government and state. If one says anything against the party ideology or their handlers, the RSS, it is interpreted as an attack on the nation. This closely reflects Trump’s America (and indeed our two societies are becoming bizarre complements of each other even in micro situations in thoughts actions words and deeds) by Trump’s repeated use of the words, "" "". Perhaps this phrase was first used by Shakespeare in his play,   where two tribunes, Brutus and Cicinius call Coriolanus the “enemy of the people”, but it is a label that tyrants and dictators have used freely over the centuries when trying to deflect blame from themselves. It is used when a tyrant needs to conflate his own self with the collective so that any attack on him is seen as an attack on collective interests. The phrase was first used in a modern political sense by revolutionaries during the French Revolution when they would nonchalantly denounce their enemies. A law was passed in 1794 during the terror explicitly targeting “enemies of the people”, which made crimes including “spreading false news” punishable by death. It is easy to slap a case of rape or criminal misdemeanor against whosoever is a whistle-blower, and lock him away indefinitely.  , a social activist and lawyer, had accused Yogi Adityanath of giving a hateful and provocative speech in Gorakhpur on January 27, 2007, which, he alleged, had led to communal clashes between two communities during a Muharram procession.

It is also easy at the moment to just instigate a lynch mob against a person by just calling him  , or simply bump him/her off in a police encounter which will be seen as “necessary” by a brainwashed population. According to a former IG of police in UP,  , “Encounters are an important part of the BJP’s governance method and are seen in all states ruled by them. This means that there is inordinate amount of pressure on the police to undertake encounters.” In February 2016, after slogans were allegedly raised on the JNU campus against the hanging of Afzal Guru,   were both arrested on grounds of sedition and raising purportedly anti-India slogans (which later turned out to be untrue on the grounds of forensic evidence of tapes.)

In addition to sedition charges, the students were charged with ""instigating hate between two communities"". The whole thing was dropped after the then CM of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, tweeted several times that the sedition charges against the students were an overreaction. The overreaction has now assumed sinister proportions. Recently, in another development, Congress digital communications chief  was charged with sedition for a meme depicting the PM in a poor light post the Rafale deal controversy. The irony being that such memes against Dr Manmohan Singh (and worse) were par for the course for BJP IT cell workers in the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. A substantial number of them were followed and still continue to be followed by PM Modi himself. Since when has the prime ministerial chair become equivalent to the state? The  . It was not a part of IPC in the 1860s and was even dropped from the law. It was introduced in the IPC in 1870. Many Indian freedom fighters, including Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, were charged with sedition during freedom struggle. Section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code, named 'Sedition', explains sedition in wide and magnanimous terms. It says: The explanations, which the Indian Penal Code gives, are that the expression 'disaffection' includes disloyalty and all feelings of hate. However, according to Section 124-A, comments expressing strong disapproval of the ""administrative or other action of the government without exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, do not constitute an offense under this section"". When the first amendment was introduced, which also included detailed limitations on free speech, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was categorical in his belief that the offence of sedition was fundamentally unconstitutional. He had said: ""Now, so far as I am concerned [Section 124-A] is highly objectionable and obnoxious and it should have no place both for practical and historical reasons. The sooner we get rid of it the better."" Perhaps something of the BJP’s mindset which finds it advantageous to conflate “nation” and “government” and “destruction of Bharat” to refusal to chant ultra nationalist slogans, can be understood from the resolution adopted by its two day national executive meet on March 2016 which stated: “ .” , in his address to the executive, that the party and the government ""was accepting of political criticism of itself, but not of the nation"". However, criticism of the BJP is increasingly being manipulated to seem criticism of the nation by hostile and cornered party spokesperson, the BJP channels like  ,  , and the social media pro-establishment activists. From questioning the opacity of the Rafale deal to demanding answers on how much of taxpayer money has been spent on the PM’s overseas travels and with what tangible results, to what action is being taken against gau rakshak-lynch mobs who have been clearly identified, one may expect a wall of silence and hostility with a wrong and motivated interpretation of threat to common purpose and ""destruction of Bharat"".  Venkaiah Naidu make frequent appeals to us to decolonise ourselves — from the English language, from  , and the ""western mentality"". The sedition law is also a colonial British relic used to curb free speech during India’s Independence struggle. Now, the government is using it to silence and harass those with divergent opinions and it is time we repealed and did away with it.

159,Sharat Pradhan,"The   of a young Apple manager by trigger-happy and corrupt cops in Lucknow raises many questions about the quality of governance in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. The incident also throws light on the “Wild West” brand of justice that prevails under the regime of the saffron-clad Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, who has often been held responsible for what is called “ ” in the state. His bid to control crime by adopting mediaeval measures has led the cops to turn into cowboys, who only shoot to kill. 38-year-old Vivek Tiwari, who looked after the marketing and sales of Apple in Lucknow, was returning home, after a late-night launch of the latest model of the iPhone on September 28, when he was beckoned by an intimidating cop to stop. Following a common advisory to avoid stopping a vehicle late at night, the techie did not consider it wise to pull the vehicle to the side, especially since he was accompanied by a woman colleague, whom he was dropping home. But it was   that what cost him his life — the insolent cop chose to pull out his gun and fired a bullet through the windscreen into the young man’s face, leaving him dead. The techie’s colleague Sana Khan, who was the only eyewitness to this cold-blooded killing, is yet to come out of shock. But she distinctly remembers how Vivek tried to manoeuvre his XUV to move away from the cop’s motorbike parked in the middle of the road, blocking his path. But before he could do so, the angry cop’s bullet had left him in a pool of blood. Far from living up to Yogi Adityanath’s much-touted claims of instilling the fear of God in the minds of outlaws who have long enjoyed a free-rein in the lawless state, this incident has only inspired terror of men in “khaki” among the common citizenry. They are stuck between the devil and the deep sea, should they have to face a situation like what Vivek faced on that fateful night. If he had stopped, there was every risk of being, not only being manhandled and possible extortion and injury, but there was also the risk of his co-passenger getting molestated by the cops. After all, who hasn’t heard of such harassment by cops on duty at night? “I do not think criminals fear the police; they are usually hand-in-glove. It is the common citizen who has far more fear of the police and perhaps no respect for men in khaki”, observed a senior citizen, who had served as a Lucknow University professor for decades. Way back in 1960, a famous judge of the Allahabad High Court judge, Justice AN Mulla had said in a  , ""I say it with all sense of responsibility that there is not a single lawless group in the whole country whose record of crime is anywhere near the record of that organised unit which is known as the Indian Police Force."" The judgement finds repeated mention by the top judiciary over the years every time cops are caught indulging in such misdemeanour. Even former Supreme Court judge, Justice Markandey Katju, who has had a long experience both at the bar and bench of Allahabad High Court, states on his Facebook page, “The people of India, through their own bitter experience, have learnt about most of our policemen's misbehaviour — demanding 'hafta', doing fake encounters, refusing to lodge an FIR or conduct a proper investigation unless money is paid, custodial deaths, torture in custody, etc.” Though this was not the first time that one has heard of the police shooting down someone for not stopping his vehicle on being beckoned to do so, the difference one must note here, is the arrogant body language of the guilty cop. Even his wife, who also happens to be a police constable sought to play the victim along with her husband, who was busy claiming that he had used his gun in “self-defence”. He even went to the extent of alleging that, “The XUV driver was clearly intending to kill me by running over my motor-bike.” What is shocking is that initially, even his superiors were ready to buy the guilty cop’s alibi. Had it not been for constant hammering by the media, perhaps the Lucknow district police chief would have happily echoed his cop’s view. It was only after the intervention of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who personally spoke to both chief minister Yogi Adityanath as well as director general of police OP Singh, that a case under Section 302 was registered against the trigger-happy cop Prashant Chaudhary. Lucknow, of course, happens to be the parliamentary constituency of Rajnath Singh; thus it proved difficult for him to remain a mute spectator. Sure enough, both, the CM and the DGP, have now dutifully condemned the incident and have assured action against the “guilty”. With the obvious view to placate the victim’s grieved family, the government has also announced an   of Rs 25 lakhs as “compensation,” together with a clerical job in Lucknow Municipal Corporation for the wife of the techie who was a high-paid manager in the world’s top mobile phone company. CM Adityanath has also generously offered to transfer the case to CBI, “if the family so desired.” However, what one continues to wonder is whether the chief minister is ready to do some rethinking to his policy of encounters that had clearly given an undesirable impetus to trigger-happy policemen, who generally believe that they can get away with murder — literally. The tendency has manifested itself in the 1600-odd encounters carried out by Yogi’s cops over a span of 12 months, leaving about 67 dead. Significantly, a large chunk of these were small-time outlaws, who were made “big” by announcements of handsome bounty over their heads, shortly before they were gunned down. Many BJP insiders believe that the encounter initiative was brought to life to create an impression that the government was actually serious about improving law and order, which was as precariously poor as under the Samajwadi Party regime. The fact of the matter, however, is that heinous crime continues unabated with rapes on the rise. Ironically, what continues to remain on the chief minister’s priority list was “love-jihad”, “cow-slaughter” and “anti-Romeo squads”. Meanwhile, the insolence of men in khaki seems to have grown with the passage of time. From their acts of omission or commission, it has become increasingly evident that cops exist only to serve the privileged class and not the common man. Remember, in the infamous Unnao incident where a helpless father of a gang-rape victim was lynched to death inside the police station, cops looked the other way because the oppressor was the ruling BJP MLA. It was only after the incident hit the headlines and the High Court took   cognisance of the horrific developments, that the state government spluttered into action. The common tendency, among those sitting in positions of power, is to defend the indefensible. The rogues among the khaki-clad often get the undue patronage of their superiors, who invariably remain in denial mode when it comes to such insolent or corrupt behaviour of their subordinates. This malaise can be tackled only if the government were to follow the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in consonance with the Prakash Singh Police Reforms Committee’s recommendations. One of the key recommendations was to separate the law and order functions of the police from investigations. A renowned top cop who headed the UP police as well as Punjab police in addition to BSF, Prakash Singh, had explicitly called for an independent investigation agency. And that recommendation was duly ratified by the apex court more than five years ago. But successive state governments chose to turn a deaf ear to it. The result is obvious — in a case like the murder of Vivek Tiwari, the investigation will now be carried out by his own colleagues, doubling as investigators-cum-enforcers of law and order. And who can deny that blood is thicker than water? Hence, it would be of no surprise if the investigators find subtle ways to protect their comrade-in-arms. No wonder such cases often find their way to the CBI, which despite erosion, continues to enjoy some reputation of objectivity as an independent investigation agency.",2018-09-30,"Yogi Adityanath,Encounter raj,Uttar Pradesh,Vivek tiwari","Killing of Apple techie by trigger-happy, corrupt UP police raises many questions",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/vivek-tiwari-uttar-pradesh-murder-police-raj-encounter-raj-yogi-adityanath-corruption/story/1/26984.html
160,Sarah Salvadore,"On Thursday, most of the United States and those across the globe interested in politics and gender issues, were glued to their viewing devices, catching the live testimonies of Dr Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Dr Ford, a well-respected professor of clinical psychology,   of sexual assault, while they were in high school. The allegation came during the Senate confirmation hearing of Kavanaugh. Since then,   have come forward with their accounts of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh.  And on cue, people have been   for speaking up three decades after the incident.  The answer to this has pretty much played out in the past few weeks — in addition to having to relive her trauma, Dr Ford has faced a smear campaign, had her character attacked and faced death threats. She had to   for security reasons.  Contrary to belief, women who come forward to report assault are not motivated by money or fame. In fact, by speaking up, they most certainly enter an atmosphere that is antagonistic — exposing themselves to vicious public abuse and death threats. Sexual assault is a humiliating — and dehumanising — act against someone. And when a survivor has to speak about her trauma again and again, she feels invaded and defiled. Sharing a story of assault requires trust. In a hostile environment, this is hard to come by.  A lot of misconceptions are part of the rape culture we live in. One of these is that if rape actually occurred, people go to the police immediately.  This is completely contradictory to how trauma works.  Trauma is one of the lasting effects of assault and as a society, we have very limited knowledge of it. Women are often forced to compartmentalise their pain – to move ahead rather than speak up, because the burden of proof is always on the victim, rather than the accused.  And then, there is shame. Linked to that shame is self-condemnation. Victims blame themselves — because culturally victim-blaming is rampant. “She shouldn’t have worn a short skirt, she shouldn’t have been drinking, why did she go out so late at night?” Sounds familiar?  Silence is the best option, because the assaulter is either someone from the family, a friend, an acquaintance or a person too powerful. In Dr Ford’s case, Judge Kavanaugh came from an elite, upper class, privileged background, and his mother served as a  .  In the era of #MeToo reckoning, things have finally started to change.  However, they haven’t changed enough for one woman’s word to be believed on its own without corroborating evidence. Or, without the argument that her experience has timed out. What people, especially men, don’t realise is that the statute of limitation for trauma does not exist.  Survivors bury trauma into the deepest recesses of their minds, going on with their lives, without realising the daily impact it has. But when your assaulter is being considered for an eminent position, in one of the highest institutions of the government, it acts as a trigger.  If one needs more examples of why victims don’t come forward, they should look no further than the   on Twitter, to understand the web of shame, pain and slanted power dynamics that kept survivors from speaking out.  What happened to Dr Ford resonates with every woman across the globe who’s reported her assault or thought of doing so.  It’s not an American issue. It’s a women’s issue. One might argue that today, the laws against rape are stricter than what they used to be. True. But what’s also true is that the criminal justice system is known to drag its feet when it comes to investigating sexual assault or misconduct. While more women are willing to report sexual assault, it doesn’t necessarily translate to a conviction or justice for the victim. The government can strengthen the laws on rape, but it’s implementation is what ultimately matters. And more often than not, law enforcement has mishandled cases due to pressure. They also lack sensitivity and dignity when dealing with victims and their families, found  .  All these facts bring us to the question of how we view sexual assault and misconduct as a society.  Women are often seen as ‘expendable’ — easily sacrificed at the altar of men who “don’t know better” or “were too young”. Some of the voices speaking for Judge Kavanaugh that we heard were shocking, to say the least — many felt that Kavanaugh was being targeted for being “young and silly” or “doing what boys do”.  We are taught from a very young age to look the other way when men commit ‘indiscretions.’ Acts like stalking or groping are normalised. “These things happen. It’s all a part of growing up” — by saying so, society only encourages troublesome behavior. Is it a surprise that an argument like this breeds entitled indifference to girls and women?  When   for sexual assault, it sparked an international debate. The judge worried that a stricter sentence would have a “severe impact” on the 20-year-old, while his father thought it was too heavy a price for “20 minutes of action.” All of this was offensive and completely insensitive to the pain of the survivor. The fact is, Brock is only a product of a rape culture we’ve nurtured by looking the other way.  A lawmaker recently said that, “If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried.”  Well, I say it’s a good thing.  Maybe this will start a conversation and force us to change the way we look at sexual assault.  This time in history can be used as a teachable moment for young men — you will be held accountable for your actions.  Let’s not forget that the attitude of “boys will be boys” also lowers the standard of conduct we expect from men - including those aspiring to the highest offices of our land.  ",2018-09-30,"Patriarchy,Donald Trump,Christine ford,Brett kavanaugh","Ford vs Kavanaugh should teach all men, you will be held accountable for your actions ",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/ford-vs-kavanaugh-donald-trump-rape-culture-us-senate/story/1/26975.html
161,Pooja Shali,"Every few months in the Kashmir Valley, one news report re-surfaces across media. It is titled along these lines somewhat: ‘Last Hindu died and funeral rites arranged by Muslim neighbours — a sign of  ’. Such heartening reports always mention similar quotes and the same demographics. Only the names and the location are changed, as per incident.  It is pertinent to ask then — who benefits from such a story, repeated occasionally, but deliberately?  The dead have gone and minority groups are conspicuous by silence, so who are these stories representative of? In the past two years, seven “only Kashmiri Pandits” passed away across the region. A reminder about solitary families existing in the Valley. And a deserving question should be asked of how did the numbers fall so low.  But the focus instead is on the Muslim  community’s effort for the last rites rather than the people who died. This is not an isolated case but indeed, an increasing trend to   between the two communities — a charade that was in fact ripped away after 1989.  The predicament is not that the media reports mention an incident, but the cringe-worthy selective exaggeration to highlight an agenda on a loop. Is this an attempt to whitewash the  ?  A turmoil handled irresponsibly by a callous government continues to show its impact 29 years on. Due to the absence of a narrative in intellectual discourse, outrage over the forced exile of the Kashmiri Pandits has turned to murmurs — eventually fading away. It is understandable that distraught neighbours, having grown up with one Hindu family around, would rush to help and assist after an elderly person's demise. It is a fact acknowledged by most Hindu families in Kashmir that Muslim neighbourhoods are helpful during celebrations and solemn occasions. Especially during deaths, their neighbours console Hindu locals and ensure that a grieving family is not left alone. But to blow this aspect of camaraderie as a trumpet for secularism is a tragic reflection of the dominating majoritarian view. Real instances showcase this.  In one case from Srinagar in 2018, reports surfaced that an old Hindu woman had died and in the absence of her own relatives, she was cremated by members of the majority community. This was a lie. The reality was that the woman’s husband and adult son lived in the same house and conducted the rites, as per traditions. The family was joined also by other Kashmiri Pandits (KPs), who arrived soon as the information spread. Most Muslim neighbours, though, were the first to reach their house and ensure all required items were arranged, in this hour of grief. The families had known each other for decades, so empathetic neighbours ensured their presence, reflective of a sweet but an expected humane gesture. How did these facts, of a mere presence and assistance, transform into claims of 'implementation', of actually conducting the last rites? I spoke to this specific family after the incident and a male member was deeply upset of how their grief was used to score brownie points for Kashmiriyat. He even raised a counter — but his view was never published. This has happened earlier too.  In 2016, a news agency reported from the Malvan village of south  . Similar references were attempted and the report went viral with appreciative responses.  Fortunately, an alert Kashmiri journalist decided to collect facts and put forth a  , debunking such lies and propaganda. Like the previous case, there were enough local Hindu residents at the site — a fact the news agency report missed, but which was raised in the counter column.  In an incident in December 2017, in South Kashmir’s Lewdora village, it was widely reported that  . The ostensible reason was an absence of their community's outreach. One report even stated, 'This story reaffirms the centuries-old bond shared between Hindus and Muslims of Kashmir'. Why was it necessary to signify the 'reaffirmation'? Also, the details were only partially incorrect. While neighbours assured care and continued to show concern, initial assistance came also from KP individuals and activist groups. Even the state government intervened and offered compensation. In fact, when the children's mother was still alive (the father had died), the cultural customs of two boys were carried out by a local KP activist group, based in Srinagar, who performed these at the Ganpatyar temple. Why then was there this need to whitewash the KP involvement in taking care of their own, and insist this was done only by local Muslims? Many Kashmiri Hindus based in the Valley have tried to raise objections at the local level against this trend — but they lack platforms at the national level. There is also a looming fear about disclosing their identity due to a lack of political support. Many residents have now even given up hope that such propaganda may ever halt. Sadly, stories of discrimination, threats, loneliness and the lack of reservation quotas get played down — in fact, these rarely make headlines. Three months ago, Qazigund in Anantnag district witnessed the death of an old Hindu man. The cremation had to be performed by a Srinagar-based resident, who rushed to the site. This was an important incident because it projected the difficulties faced by religious minorities during such times. One of the main priests for Kashmiri Pandits was Ratanlal, who used to go across the Kashmir Valley conducting last rites. He died three years ago and is deeply missed by the community. In the absence of a qualified priest, the inconvenience faced by the populace deserves to be highlighted.  Instead, death is used as a propaganda tool to show 'communal harmony'. What sort of moral grandstanding is it not to highlight the voices and concerns of a miniscule minority when they are alive — but pen down glorious pieces on their death, only to propel the majoritarian view?  Such attempts must embarrass all compassionate people. Kashmiriyat needs to emerge from a paradigm of empowerment in education, employment and empathy. An appropriate way to express secularism is by ensuring access to opportunities for the minority community that records low numbers and a non-existent narrative. Instead, Kashmiriyat is projected by throwing flowers on mortal remains, when they turn into ashes.  Kashmir is a conflict where all communities are suffering at present, where each gender is confronting a turbulent future. But the minorities, to make matters worse, have no avenue to address their grievances.  shows the Hindu minority in the state of Jammu and Kashmir stand at about 28.44%. In the Kashmir Valley, shockingly, the numbers stand between 1-3%. In some areas, the numbers stand in fractions, where the same people once had a visible presence. India’s civil society has usually seen the Kashmir conflict from the eyes of state vs citizen. But the micro-level details are more disheartening as minority groups tend to face intimidation, communal undertones and even suggestions to convert their faith. Testimonies often cannot be recorded but it does not mean everything is normal. Also, Jammu and Kashmir does not boast of a strong minority face as an elected representative — and thus, voices remain absent.  The   — but the result was zilch. Neither did a process of rehabilitation begin at any promised scale, nor did the ones staying back receive any reprieves. The  ). A number of  but an ongoing legal tussle blocked that possibility too.  The least one could now do is encourage minority voices to speak and demand their rights in Kashmir.

162,Minhaz Merchant,"Is the Rafale fighter jet deal likely to be Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bofors? Or has Congress President Rahul Gandhi overplayed his hand? Rahul was 17 years old when the   broke in the summer of 1987. His father Rajiv Gandhi (a decent man surrounded at work and home by those with a weak grip on integrity) was savaged by the media and the Opposition over Bofors. Rahul must have awoken every morning to  addressed to his father on Bofors on the front page of  He would have heard the Opposition’s daily cry: “ Rajiv Gandhi ” Two years later, Rajiv lost the  . His 414-seat majority fell below 200 seats. Thirty years later, the scars of Bofors haven’t healed for the Gandhis. There are six key elements in the Rafale deal that need the disinfectant of sunlight: The Congress alleges that this is three times the price negotiated by the UPA government. The comparision is odious and the Congress knows it. The price it quotes is for a bare bones fighter. The price for the fully loaded, nuclear-capable Rafale fighter India is buying is the same as the price paid recently by the Egyptian Air Force for a similarly weaponised Rafale and is actually lower than the price (Rs 1,705 crore) paid by the Qatar Air Force for a fully loaded Rafale. Besides, negotiations by the UPA government for the original Rafale fighter jet deal, which began over a decade ago, were for the F3 version, discontinued in 2014. The Rafale now being bought by India is the new F3R version. The current deal also includes a free bonus: France is gifting 32 retired Jaguar fighters belonging to the French Air Force to be used for spares in IAF’s ageing Jaguar fighter fleet. How significant are these? Abhijit Iyer-Mitra, a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, says: “Very significant. The RBE2 active radar gives the Indian Air Force (IAF) a huge edge against Chinese and Pakistani fighters. The Meteor missile and the new front sector infrared tracker are also very important in tracking the new-generation Chinese stealth fighters. ""They are shaped to evade radar so instead you track them by the heat signature of the exhaust which can't be masked. The enhancements include the helmet-mounted display which shows all the information on the visor/goggles. This means missiles can be launched by simply looking at the target and that split second advantage is critical in a close combat situation. Besides, there will be nuclear modifications on the Rafale that nobody will talk about publicly.”  Rahul has focused on this following  . Who chose Anil Ambani’s Reliance? French President Emmanuel Macron and Dassault have both stated publicly that all vendors for the Rafale offset programme were chosen by Dassault. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) is also among these 72 vendors. The 36 Rafale fighters will arrive from France in flyaway condition. Should they have instead been manufactured by HAL in India? Says Iyer-Mitra: “HAL is so incompetent that it has never been able to produce an aircraft cheaper than imports. Save for the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) it has only produced metal aircraft. Composites (carbon fibre) aircraft are much more complex and HAL only produces three LCAs per year and of highly variable quality. The problem was that in the earlier 126 aircraft negotiations for the Rafale, HAL refused to accept responsibility for the quality of the parts it produced and wanted Dassault to be held responsible for any flaws.” Dassault chose 72 Indian vendors for its Make in India offset programme mandated at 50 per cent (Rs 29,000 crore) of the contract’s value (Rs 58,000 crore). Rahul Gandhi has trained his guns on only one of those 72 vendors —  . Why? Anil Ambani’s Reliance group is likely to receive between Rs 3,500 crore and Rs 5,000 crore, or around 12-15 per cent of the offset programme — a far cry from the over Rs 1,00,000 crore “scam” Rahul has alleged against Reliance. The notorious arms dealer  , ran a company called Offset India Solutions (OIS). OIS bid for the Rafale offsets contract in 2012 during the UPA2 regime. Bhandari is close to Robert Vadra as publicly disclosed emails, foreign property transactions and phone transcripts have revealed. Dassault examined OIS’s capabilities for offsets and rejected its bid in 2012. The contract for 126 Rafales being negotiated by the UPA government since 2007 was coincidentally cancelled in 2012, shortly after Dassault rejected the bid by Bhandari’s OIS for offsets. The then Defence Minister  justified the cancellation of the 126-fighter Rafale deal on camera: “Where is the money?” was more direct at a press conference on September 24, 2018: “Rahul Gandhi is peeved and has launched a campaign against the Rafale deal as his brother-in-law Robert Vadra and his friend and business partner have been denied brokerage. The Congress president wants the deal cancelled to teach Dassault a lesson as he is angry over how his brother-in-law could not be a beneficiary. Rahul Gandhi should explain to the nation why the deal for Rafale fighters was cancelled in 2012. Was it only cancelled when Vadra and his friend were rejected by Dassault as middlemen?” In May 2016, Bhandari’s offices in New Delhi were raided by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Bhandari was booked under the Official Secrets Act (OSA). Confidential defence ministry documents were found by the ED in his offices during the raids. He subsequently fled India and is untraceable. The inability of the prime minister’s office (PMO) to clean up a corrupt IAS/IPS lobby working in tandem with criminals could prove Modi’s single biggest failing.  described to Ashis Ray of  in an interview on September 25, 2018 how corrupt officials in government sabotage criminal probes. In the infamous Ravi Shankaran case, where Shankaran allegedly stole classified material from the   with the connivance of officials and shared it with India’s enemies and competing foreign defence companies, Ojha says: “Records would confirm that proceedings against him could not progress as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) blatantly ignored my repeated pleas to forward the extradition request in the prescribed Hague Convention format.” Does the Congress’ criticism of Reliance’s inexperience in making spare parts for  line of business jets (not Rafale fighters as is sought to be implied) stand up to scrutiny? Reliance Defence and Engineering (RDEL) acquired Pipavav Shipyard, an 18-year-old company, in 2015. It had by then gained significant expertise in building warships. It then built capabilities in advanced avionics: Aircraft Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), Terrain Avoidance Warning System (TAWS) and other aerostructure equipment. Is that expertise sufficient for it to qualify as one of 72 vendors (including Tata, Mahindra, L&T, HAL and Bharat Forge) to make offset spare parts for business jets (not Rafale fighters)? The Congress has remained tactically silent on this issue. The Congress has sought the intervention of the CVC and CAG but not yet of the courts where statements, if found false, attract perjury. Concrete evidence of malfeasance has to be provided. With the introduction of the Bhandari-Vadra angle, the Congress’ attack on Prime Minister Modi’s personal role in the Rafale deal has curiously, but not entirely surprisingly, lost some of its momentum.

163,Javed Anwer,"Among the many ways in which social media – or rather Facebook to be precise – has changed the world, arguably the most drastic has been its ability to make borders irrelevant. The Internet has always worked without any regard for borders. But earlier, it was more about the data that would travel across the world. Facebook has now enabled entire communities to transcend borders. There was a time when we all thought that this was a change for the good. But now, as countless examples including the "" "" of the US elections show, we are waking up to the chaos that Facebook's borderless communities bring to the real world. In 1990, John Guare popularised the idea of Six Degrees of Separation. He argued that everyone on the earth is separated from someone else by six steps. In other words, what he meant was that you could connect two random people in the world in six steps by linking friends of friends. Facebook in 2016 announced that it had made the Six Degrees of Separation irrelevant. In a  titled ""Three and a half degrees of separation"" its engineers said, ""Each person in the world (at least among the 1.59 billion people active on Facebook) is connected to every other person by an average of three and a half other people."" This must be a nice thing, a mass of humans connected in a better way? It seems we were mistaken. Even though an easier way to reach others allows us to do wonderful things – like the whole world coming together to raise a substantial sum of money for the treatment of a cancer patient in an Indian town – it also makes it easy to create differences. And as more people use Facebook, and realise its potential to disrupt communities and societies, many are using it not to bring together people but to break them apart. Doing so serves a purpose – such as influencing the voting patterns. This is what happened during the   and during the   in Britain, where the Russian hackers reportedly managed to wrest control of the political discourse through Facebook to such an extent that it resulted in a win for Donald Trump in the US and Leave Vote in the UK. The fear is that this sort of hacking is also going on in India ahead of the crucial 2019 vote. Especially because it's easy to pull off. When we talk of hacking, the image that comes to mind is that someone somewhere is trying to get into computers, or trying to take apart a machine like EVM. The classic definition of hacking, however, is different. It simply means not playing by the rules and exploiting a system using its weaknesses. So when you hear that Russians hacked the US election, it doesn't mean they got into EVMs used in Alabama. Or that they managed to somehow change the vote count. It simply means they disrupted the discourse before the vote using the weaknesses that are part of the way Facebook works and created sentiments that helped Trump and harmed Hillary. These ""hackers"" used Facebook very smartly. They probably set up Facebook communities, ran Facebook advertisements, ran fake news sites and then shared ""news"" from these sites on Facebook, and made memes that went viral and dented Hillary Clinton's credibility. All because it is so easy to do. Now, think of India as it goes into the 2019 elections. ""Hackers"", whether internally or from China, Pakistan, Russia, France or some other country, can easily influence the Indian election process. Maybe they are already doing it. With almost every household in India owning a smartphone, and with millions of Indians using WhatsApp and Facebook, running a misinformation campaign from China or Pakistan is very easy. And this misinformation campaign can then be tuned to help one political party over other, because that may serve the purpose of an external power. So if China doesn't want the BJP in power it can put to work a few hackers and social media experts and set up some 100 Facebook communities that would create memes against BJP and the Modi government. These memes will reach millions of Facebook users in India and influence their judgment. Or maybe Pakistan wants BJP government to remain in power, in which case it can run 50 Facebook communities for Indians, which will only popularise anti-Congress content – ""Pappu fail hoga"", ""Italians go home"" and that sort of stuff. The way social media works, where nuances are lost, where you don't know if the news of someone's murder is fake or accurate, the fact that this news came to you from a friend you grew up with, or from someone called Sergei – who is pretending to be Rahul – becomes irrelevant, thus making it difficult to combat misinformation. In the US, even with their sophisticated cyber tools the NSA, CIA and FBI have not been able to catch the Russian meddling. In India, if foreigners want to muddle the scene during elections they can do so very easily. This is where the Election Commission of India comes into the picture. In the US, after regulatory pressure, Facebook is starting to act. It has started scrutinising the advertisers buying political ads to ensure they are not foreigners. It has started tracking the communities that do political messaging and make memes that go viral. It has started looking at the political discourse that takes place on its platform. However, in India Facebook's measures to check ""hacking"" of elections remain rudimentary so far. This is probably because it feels no pressure from the ECI and the government to take more stringent steps. It is also probably because the ECI continues working with Facebook, something that probably allows Facebook to have even better voter data and preferences that it can sell to advertisers.  Ideally, the Indian government should be asking Facebook and WhatsApp to bring the same sort of measures to India that it is taking in the US to combat political misinformation. And ideally, the ECI and Indian regulators should be keeping a closer watch on the origins of WhatsApp and Facebook messages that go viral. ",2018-09-28,"Hacking,Russia,Cambridge Analytica,Brexit","Wake up EC, it's time to see if foreigners are hacking Indian elections or not",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/election-commission-2019-lok-sabha-polls-brexit-cambridge-analytica-russia-hacking/story/1/26950.html
164,DailyBite,"A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, on September 28,   in the arrest of five rights activists in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon violence case. The court also rejected the plea by the accused for a SIT probe into the matter. A majority 2:1 judgment read out by Justice AM Khanwilkar said the activists will remain under house arrest for four more weeks. The five activists — Varavara Rao, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha — are under arrest at their respective homes since August 29. The SC was hearing a plea by historian Romila Thapar against the arrests. The judgment said it was not a case of arrest because of dissent or differing political ideology, but there was   material to show their link with the banned CPI (Maoist) group. The probe would continue and the activists could pursue relief from the lower courts. Justice Khanwilkar also said the court has desisted from giving its observations on the matter as it may affect the case. Justice Chandrachud, on the other hand, gave a dissenting view, observing the arrest was an attempt to muzzle dissent, which is a symbol of a vibrant democracy. ""The court has to be vigilant that liberty is not sacrificed on the altar of conjecture. The conduct of police to use the media to cast aspersion on the activists is questionable,"" Justice Chandrachud said. Justice Chandrachud also recounted the arrest of scientist Nambi Narayan, who was arrested in 1994 on charges of espionage along with another senior ISRO official, two Maldivian women and a businessman in the  , where Kerala police had filed chargesheets against several scientists. ""Recently, Supreme Court   to a scientist of Rs. 50 lakh after 24 years of the incident,"" Justice Chandrachud said, pointing to the shoddy conduct of the police during the investigation. The scandal destroyed the careers of two brilliant scientists — Narayanan and D Sasi Kumar. Apart from having links with Maoists, the most serious charge levelled against the activists is an alleged plot to assasinate the PM. Last month, the Pune police had claimed they had   of the activists' links to the Maoists and their role in facilitating weapons and funding, but sought an   from the court in September to file a chargesheet. Sudha Bharadwaj, one of the arrested activists, has welcomed the minority judgment of Justice Chandrachud who questioned the Pune police's claims of incriminating evidence against them. On the majority judgment, she said she is happy that the court has given them respite by extended the house arrest. 
 
 Lashing out at the Narendra Modi government, she called the arrests a 'witch hunt' by the ruling party. The case may not have reached its logical conclusion yet, but that has not stopped political parties from politicising the issue. BJP's Sambit Patra has said the verdict is a 'vindication' of his party's stand. Earlier in August, when the activists were arrested, Rahul Gandhi had accused the RSS of shutting down NGOs and jailing activists who complain. ""There is only place for one NGO in India and it's called the RSS. Shut down all other NGOs. Jail all activists and shoot those that complain. Welcome to the new India,"" he had tweeted. After the SC verdict, BJP President Amit Shah attacked Rahul Gandhi, saying the Congress was politicising an issue of national security. 
 
 Shah accused the Congress of supporting the 'Tukde Tukde Gang', Maoists, fake activists and corrupt elements. While the BJP is toeing the nationalistic line to digress from burning issues like price rise and corruption charges, the Opposition is in no mood to relent. Amid looming fear of its upper caste vote bank getting poached by the Congress' soft Hindutva, the BJP will only push back with counter charges. Already pushed onto the back foot by a united Opposition trying to cobble together a rainbow of caste vote banks, PM Modi-led BJP will leave no issue out to take on its opponents.

165,Sandip Ghose,"One of the first steps Mamata Banerjee took, after coming to power, was abolishing state-sponsored “bandhs”, a legacy of Left rule. There’s a running joke that Banerjee increased the number of state holidays, especially for religious festivals of different communities, to balance out the number of effective working days increased because   were eliminated. This move was a significant signal for changing the work culture in the state. To her credit, Mamata Banerjee has followed this decision without exception. Thus, despite her greater involvement in national politics, her party stayed away from the recent Opposition-sponsored Bharat Bandh on September 10, organised in protest against rising petrol and diesel prices. Hence, the BJP should not have had any illusion about the prospects of the Bangla Bandh it organised yesterday. BJP leaders and the high command in Delhi should have known that it would, at best, be a symbolic exercise with little impact in most parts of the state. Not surprisingly, therefore, barring a few sporadic incidents in some parts of central Bengal, where the BJP has made some inroads and a few pockets in and around Kolkata, the bandh was generally uneventful. However, political observers nationally have been long speculating about whether West Bengal will be the next frontier of the BJP’s expansionist strategy for 2019. This bandh would not have made them any the wiser. Over the last five years, the BJP has made a number of false starts and non-starts in West Bengal. The party’s strategy has been both inconsistent and unsure. It has been more a case of one-step-forward and two-steps-back. Some attribute the “now on, now off” approach to the BJP top leadership’s uncertain assessment of Mamata Banerjee. With her innate political instinct, she has kept the Modi-Shah duo guessing. This, BJP and TMC watchers think, has also been reflected in the blow-hot, blow-cold approach of the CBI and the ED on Saradha and other investigations. Though over the years the RSS has expanded its presence in a number of districts, the BJP’s state leadership has been unimpressive. After trying a few change of faces, the BJP central leadership finally concluded that, “what you do not have, you must acquire”. This was the Assam model. But here, there was no ""Pidi"" to push a Bengali version of Himanta Biswa Sarma to the BJP’s lap. Besides, Mamata Banerjee is no Tarun Gogoi. Though at some point, it seemed almost certain that Mukul Roy would cross over with some other TMC leaders to the BJP, Banerjee was able to scuttle any internal revolt or defection with the deft political handling of a charismatic leader, who has her fingers firmly on the pulse of the state. Finally, after an extended courtship — some say, protracted negotiations — Mukul Roy joined the BJP, a few months ago. Roy’s entry was low-key. Probably because Amit Shah did not wish to disturb the existing satraps and the RSS in the state by inducting a rank outsider. Though Mukul has, of late, become more vocal and visible, he is still working more in the background and at the grassroots. He has been assigned the task of building the electoral organisation for the party, which has been his forte and claim to fame in the TMC. Meanwhile, between 2014 and now, there has been a seismic shift on the ground. At the time of the last Lok Sabha elections, the BJP was riding in West Bengal on essentially two factors. The first was the rise in the “non-Bengali” population the state. This comprised early settlers — essentially from Rajasthan who form the majority of the trading community and migrant workers from the neighbouring states of Bihar and Jharkhand. The second was the Modi wave which helped in consolidation (mind you, not polarisation) of the Hindu vote and swing the middle-class moderate Hindu voters towards the BJP. Both these elements reflected in the sharp increase of the BJP vote-share in 2014. Babul Supriyo’s freak victory from Asansol can be attributed to the “non-Bengali” population in the coal belt moving solidly towards the BJP. But, in other areas, even a combination of the two factors was not enough to take the BJP first past the post. Still, it certainly made it a rising force in West Bengal, with the decimation of the Left and the terminal decline of the Congress in the state. Since then, much water has flown down the Hooghly and the Modi wave has all but dissipated. The business and trading community of all hues are disenchanted with the BJP’s policy and performance at the centre. The urban middle-class is now more skeptical about the Modi-Shah leadership and what it augurs for the nation. This has radically changed the state of play, requiring the BJP to revisit its electoral strategy, just as it has to do in the rest of the country. Even in West Bengal, the BJP cannot depend on middle-of-the-road Hindu voters to make a dent any longer. If there is any anti-incumbency building up, it is in deep rural areas. In certain parts of rural Bengal, there is a sense of déjà vu of the Left Front era when not even a leaf moved in the villages against the will of the local party bosses. This may cause creeping discontent and resentment which was, perhaps, noticed during the recent Panchayat elections. The BJP sees an opportunity in these cracks — especially in the districts where communal demographics have sharply changed in recent years. But such a strategy will hinge on playing the polarisation card unabashedly. Therefore, in yesterday's bandh, one heard the BJP State President raise the “Jai Shree Ram” cry, which was missing in the run-up to 2014. With this comes a new layer of language chauvinism — Urdu versus Bengali. Of course, the final salvo will be raising the Bangladeshi angle with all the talk of NRC. In the last few days, there has been talk about one of the last remaining Congress leaders of the state, Adhir Chowdhury, walking over to the BJP. Chowdhury has a strong base in the Muslim-dominant Murshidabad region bordering Bangladesh. Thus, in a way, he will be another acquisition like Mukul Roy for Amit Shah. The BJP doesn’t have much to lose in Bengal. But how much it can gain from a muscular strategy is difficult to predict at this stage. How the scenario unfolds in the coming months will also depend on to what extent the BJP plays the Hindutva and Ram Mandir cards nationally, along with following through on the NRC process in neighbouring Assam. These will no doubt have a huge spillover effect in Bengal. As I have have maintained in my previous   in  , Mamata Banerjee remains firmly in control. She is unarguably the greatest mass leader the state has produced and her core constituency remains solidly behind her. The BJP is aware of that, and may simply be trying to keep her engaged in Bengal. While there is no imminent threat to her party, any major precipitation will affect her image nationally. So, it does put a huge onus on Mamata Banerjee to maintain equilibrium in the state. She has a lot at stake. But she is too sharp a politician to let the situation slip from her hand. She knows her best days are yet to come.",2018-09-27,"West Bengal,BJP,Mamata Banerjee,Bengal bandh",BJP's Bengal Bandh was bound to be insignificant.

166,Saif Ullah Khan,"A three-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by CJI Dipak Misra on September 27   that the 1994 Ismail Faruqui judgment need not be referred to a larger bench. In a majority 2:1 judgment, the SC declined to revisit its own 1994 ruling. CJI Dipak Misra and Justice Ashok Bhushan denied the plea, saying the 1994 ruling was made in the context of acquisition. Justice Bhushan, reading out the judgment on behalf of the CJI, said the earlier order of mosques not being integral to Islam was in the context of the State's right to acquire land under eminent domain. He said the earlier judgment has no bearing on the final Ayodhya verdict and hence, there was no need to reconstitute a new bench. Since the earlier judgment was only with respect to immunity from acquisition, it would not impact the Ayodhya land title suit. A three-judge bench will continue to hear the Ayodhya land title dispute and the hearing will resume from October 29. However Justice Abdul Nazeer dissented with his brother judges and said whether a mosque was integral to Islam needed a comprehensive examination and there was a need to refer the matter to a constitutional bench. He said what is essential to religion as laid down in the Ismail Faruqui case was arrived at without a comprehensive examination of religious texts. Hence, the issue needs to be re-examined in detail. He also   that the observations in the 1994 ruling have permeated the Allahabad High Court Ayodhya verdict of 2010 and the judgment needs to be brought in line with the Shirur Matt case. In 1994, while   of Dr Ismail Faruqui, a five-judge Supreme Court bench held that a mosque is not an essential part of the practice of Islam. It said that namaz could be offered anywhere and a mosque was not required for it. Dr Faruqi had challenged the acquisition of 67.7 acres land around the disputed structure. Ironically, reacting to the recent cases of disruption of namaz in open spaces in BJP-ruled Haryana, CM Manohar Lal Khattar had said there was no need to offer namaz in open spaces. This should only be offered in mosques.  The judgment paves the way for the resumption of the Ayodhya case and the timing of the verdict could alter the results of the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections. With the ruling BJP under the leadership of Narendra Modi already promising a Ram Mandir in its 2014 election manifesto, politics around the Ayodhya case will only heat up in the coming days. The most significant aspect of the post-Babri Masjid political landscape was the changed social fabric of Indian society. While communal strains between both Hindus and Muslims had always been there, the demolition and the subsequent communal violence displaced caste with religion in the political discourse. The BJP was successfully able to take on caste-based parties like Mulayam Singh Yadav's SP and Lalu Yadav's RJD. The party's dream of cobbling together a cohesive Hindu vote bank was finally taking shape. After losing out to the Congress in 2004, and subsequently in 2009, the BJP had to fall back on its 'Hindu hriday samrat', Narendra Modi, to bring the party back to power. Going into 2017's Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections without a CM face, the BJP eventually zeroed in on another firebrand Hindutva leader, Yogi Adityanath, to head its government in the state. Predictably, the Ram Mandir was a part of the party's election manifesto   released by BJP president Amit Shah. The party reaped a rich harvest of votes focusing its campaign on the so-called Hindu exodus in Kairana, love jihad and the preservation of cows. But the last four years again altered the political landscape and threw a new set of challenges to the BJP. With its 2014 promise of 'achhe din' gone out to pasture, the party is faced with alleged corruption and nepotism charges, lack of jobs, and the politically suicidal price rise. All issues it had earlier taken up the Congress on. The BJP also went back on its poll promise of scrapping Article 370, when it decided to put it on the back burner to form a government with PDP in Jammu and Kashmir.  Probably realising the importance of ramping up the issue again, the party decided to walk out of the alliance in 2018 citing irreconcilable differences. Putting the blame for all that ails the country at the doorsteps of Nehru and the Gandhis is not bearing fruit anymore. The Narendra Modi government is expected to provide a list of its own achievements, something it is finding increasingly hard to do. Earlier asking for just five years to prove himself, the Modi government seems to have set a new deadline of 2022, but the voters are not taking the bait. It is also faced with a united Opposition, which, having realised the dangers of a united Hindu vote bank breaching its own political fortress, have come together to stop Modi from getting a second term. The 2017 by-poll defeats in Kairana, earlier held by the BJP's late MP Hukum Singh, who had floated the now debunked Hindu exodus theory, the Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats, vacated by the party's UP CM and Deputy CM, at the hands of a united Opposition, has put the party on the back foot. The prospect of SC/STs, OBCs and Muslims coming together is a nightmare the BJP could do without. A favorable verdict in the Ayodhya case could be a major shot in the arm of the the Narendra Modi government which had earlier been accusing the Opposition, and especially the Congress, of minority appeasement. While the official party line is Ayodhya is a matter of astha (belief), the political benefits are not lost on the party. With newly anointed Shiv bhakt, Congress President 'januedhari' Rahul Gandhi, increasingly toeing the soft Hindutva line, the BJP needs some serious juice to ramp up its own Hindutva quotient. In an attempt to reassure its Hindutva vote bank, several leaders of the BJP have already said that the party could also take an ordinance route if the Ayodhya judgment was not favourable. With the Supreme Court paving the way for an early verdict, the politics around the Ram Mandir is already getting a jumpstart.",2018-09-27,"Namaz,Supreme Court,Babri Masjid demolition,Ayodhya dispute","Forget 'achhe din', Supreme Court's Ayodhya case verdict could pave the way for Modi's return in 2019",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/ayodhya-verdict-supreme-court-babri-masjid-namaz-lok-sabha-elections-2019-hindutva/story/1/26921.html
167,Sadhavi Khosla,"As an offspring of the Sangh Parivar, the Bhartiya Janta Party started gaining popularity in independent India through the   in the 1980s. The thrust of the BJP’s political existence were essentially two ideas: One, as Ashok Singhal stated, was the ideals of “Gai-Ganga-Ayodhya” and their attainment. Two, a vendetta against the Congress’s “minority appeasement”. What initially looked like the voice of the Hindus in the political circuit of India, slowly and gradually, exposed itself as a party which used Hindu culture, religion and sentiments for their political gains, when given a chance. The BJP was given a chance to prove their loyalty towards Hindus from 1998-2004 (as they led the NDA) and most importantly, in 2014. It was not just the RSS, which backed Modi as the protector of Hindus, but the-then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, himself, along with his aide Amit Shah, that asserted their roles as protectors of Hinduism. Modi is in fact called the “Hindu Hridya Samrat”. The Hindus thus believed in the BJP for being their shield and proponents of “Hindustan” — but what has changed since? After failing terribly on the economic and social fronts, the Modi-led BJP government failed to bring ""Achhe Din"" for Hindus as well. As I write this piece, a verdict around the Ram Mandir-Babri Masjid case is being pronounced by a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court. The reason for the BJP’s existence and the Sangh Parivar’s dominance can solely be credited to the politicisation of the Ram Mandir–Ayodhya issue. The emotions of Hindus were used as a political tool every time the BJP wanted to seek power. The general election of 2014 was no different, but this time, their appeal seemed stronger. The entire Sangh Parivar not only promised the Hindus but assured them that the Ram Mandir will finally be built. But, as   himself puts it, “The BJP betrayed Hindus by dumping the Ram Mandir issue after coming to power”. The intentions of Modi seemed crystal clear when he chose not to visit Ayodhya in the last four years. Interestingly, as opposed to the BJP, it was the Congress — under the leadership of Rajiv Gandhi — which was committed to the cause of the Ram Mandir. The saga of betrayals by the BJP did not just stop at the Ram Mandir issue. It has stepped over every single aspiration of the Hindus and their faith. The hypocrisy of the BJP is such that when the alleged protectors of “Gau mata” swore its protection and called for a ban on beef exports, they not only failed in protecting our holy cow, but also selectively showed their flexibility over the beef ban. Today, India is among the   and BJP-ruled states like Goa, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, etc., openly consume beef, which was in sharp contrast with Modi’s claims of an alleged “Pink Revolution”, which was being carried essentially by the Congress. Gau raksha — which is the utmost dharma of every Hindu — was not only put on stake thus, but has, in turn, become a mockery of the feelings of the Hindu community. The ordeal did not stop here. The Modi government went ahead and apparently persuaded their own Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy to withdraw the Cow Slaughter Ban Bill in the Upper House of Parliament. This became a moment of attestation of the intentions of how devoted and inclined the BJP was for Hindus. The list of promises made around Hindu beliefs is unending. One such promise was  , the Clean Ganga Mission, which again became the BJP’s “cast-off” after they came to power. In order to appease the Hindus, the BJP made a ministry for Ganga Rejuvenation — but it could hardly do a thing beyond budget allocation. So, how far did the BJP, the party with an absolute majority in power, really go for providing justice to the Hindus? For whom they have “allegedly” fought ever since forming a government? The biggest reflection of their failing is the silence of the party on the Uniform Civil Code. One of the many promises the BJP made was that there cannot be gender equality till India adopts a Uniform Civil Code, which protects the rights of all women, and the BJP did reiterate its stand to draft a Uniform Civil Code, drawing on the best traditions and harmonising them with modern times. The twist to this story came when the BJP chose not to reply to a law commission questionnaire on the Uniform Civil Code. While all the opposition parties responded, the BJP still has not. The BJP may have brought a law to address the issue of  , but for Indian society to become equal, there is no alternative to a Uniform Civil Code. Indeed, a very well-crafted pre-election strategy of the BJP covered all Hindu sentiments under the banner of Hindutva in 2014. What seemed interesting this time round was the apparent zeal in Modi and his party for the rights of the Kashmiri Pandits. The BJP strongly emphasisedthe return of Kashmiri Pandits to the land of their ancestors with full dignity, security and assured livelihoods. After being in power for more than four years now, the BJP has failed to rehabilitate even one single Kashmiri Pandit back to their land. The sad part is that when the BJP claimed to change the “undermined role” of Hindus in India, nobody imagined that the party could dare cheat so many Hindus on their sentiments at the same time. An otherwise “pre-election committed” BJP also failed in realising another promise that made it to their manifesto — the abrogation of Article 370 after discussions are held with stakeholders. What is amusing here is that well beyond consultations with stakeholders and an effort to repeal Article 370, the  , its own partner in its own former state coalition government. In a recent address, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said, “Since everyone says all religions are the same, what is the need for conversion?” The first thought to this is the fact that owing to extreme economic, social and political pressure, when the Hindus can’t help but feel left out, what has the Sangh and BJP done to protect the integrity of the Hindu community? If there were some efforts taken towards the protection of the Hindus, this situation would not have got worse under the rule of a political party which is Hindu in nature. The least the BJP could do to safeguard its own people was to unanimously pass an Anti–Conversion Law — which, of course, did not find a voice in the party. The extent of dissimulation under the BJP government is that the Hindu temples are under government control.  How does a party which rides on the ship of Hindu beliefs and ideology afford to stay silent on a matter of integrity and utmost disrespect? The fact is, Hindus are subjected to accountability for their place of worship, while all others are appeased under the banner of 'minority'. Where does this stop? The period from 2014 to 2018 alone has been a testimony of how appallingly the BJP has driven a nail into its own coffin. Its failure lies in the fact that its parent organisation, the RSS, is disappointed with the inaction of Modi and his government on matters of Hindu privilege and values. The situation is such that the Hindus who were disillusioned with the Congress are now disillusioned with the BJP as well. This includes the Sadhu Samaj and other religious outfits. Everybody believed Modi and Shah would deliver in full swing for the Hindu community. But little did they know that the thrust was for power, not trust. The way Modi has treated Hindus and Hinduism is a classic example of “kaamdaar and naamdaar”. Despite political pressure, the Congress, under Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and now, Rahul Gandhi, made sure that they stick to their religion as “kaamdaars”. The proof of them being “kaamdaar” is that when Indira Gandhi was in power, she was accused by ""Sikh militancy"" of being a Hindu leader. Rajiv Gandhi was the one who dared to open the locks of the Ayodhya site — and now, Rahul Gandhi fearlessly preaches his religion and spirituality. On the other hand, the “Naamdaar” Modi and his government did nothing for Hindu issues, despite their brute majority in the Lok Sabha. This is the time when the Congress can regain and win back Hindu hearts — and also, this is the time when we, the Hindus, realise that we have only been conned by the BJP. ",2018-09-27,"Congress,BJP,Ram mandir,Lok Sabha elections 2019",BJP's Con Job: The party of Hindus has only crooked Hindu voters using emotion with no real achievement,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/lok-sabha-elections-2019-what-the-bjp-gave-back-to-the-hindus-after-winning-2014-elections/story/1/26913.html
168,Mukesh Rawat,"Okay. It's normal again. India and Pakistan. ""I am good, you are bad."" ""We will avenge deaths of our soldiers in Kashmir."" ""You are a terrorist state."" ""We will wipe you out."" ""Hey hey hey! Don't mess with us… we aren't scared… we have our nukes… Beware!"" Ready for a war? ""Oh yes! At all times."" (in chorus) *** Well, you would be living under a rock, fooling yourself (perhaps drugging yourself as well) if you thought sanity is a term that can be used in the context of Indo-Pak relations. Grow up. Sanity is not normal, nor is a civilised dialogue. It was never allowed to be. What is normal in Indo-Pak relations is barbarism, hate, poison, warmongering, one-upmanship, choicest of expletives, terrorism, and threats to wipe out each other from the face of earth. Anything else (especially talks of talks, talks of peace and talks of solutions) is a divergence. A momentary relapse after a heavy hangover. At best, a shower from a cloud passing over a parched land. Nothing more. You disagree? Good. Here is a short timeline for your kind perusal. Pakistan's newly elected Prime Minister (PM)  . He proposes foreign minister-level talks in New York and calls for a dialogue on other contested issues between India and Pakistan. Khan reportedly says terrorism will be discussed separately. India says: Yes, we can. Yes, we will. Foreign ministers will meet in New York in September end on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session. (Hopes rise high. Great! Peace talks… great!) India says:   You are a barbaric country. Your true face stands exposed. (This, less than 24 hours after accepting the proposal. That was quick.) ""It's time to give it back to Pakistan. No talks [if] terror [continues],""  . Imran Khan expresses his disappointment at India's ""arrogant and negative"" response to his call for resumption of peace dialogue. Makes an indirect dig at Modi, says he [Imran] has seen ""small men occupying big offices who do not have the vision to see the larger picture"". 
 
 ""Pakistan has decided to bleed India with a thousand cuts. It wants violence in Kashmir,"" says General Rawat.  Pakistan Army spokesperson responds saying the  . ""We have nuclear weapons and aren't scared of India."" Agree with me now? Hang on. Were you too among those who had high hopes that the newly elected Imran Khan government would be different from the ones from bygone years? One minute of silence for you. And two minutes of silence if you were among those who thought the Modi government was serious about improving Indo-Pak relations. Three minutes for yours truly, because he is guilty of being under the spell of both fallacies. *** The discourse on Indo-Pak relations has always been and continues to be an important electioneering tool in India. Ahead of a crucial election, no political party can afford to ignore people's sentiments on matters related to Pakistan. Whether the sentiments are natural, or triggered by meticulously planned strategy, is not anybody's concern. What concerns political parties is that aggressive iron-hand narratives about Pakistan can fetch easy votes. Votes that would be hard to win by selling dreams of development and demonstrating work done to end poverty and unemployment, among others. If this is true (of course, it is), then you would have lost your mind to dare think that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be an exception and abandon this guaranteed vote puller in an election year. How naïve of you to venture into the forbidden territory of sanity. *** Other things aside, timing is the most (and perhaps the only) important and interesting aspect that makes the recent developments worth any analysis. The statements are mundane and cacophonous. Was Imran Khan's proposal for peace talks genuine? Was its timing strategically chosen? Was Modi genuinely averse to going ahead with the foreign ministers' meet? Was the timing of the overnight decision to take a U-turn strategically chosen?  What was the message(s)? Who were the respective target audiences? How much of the message(s) has been conveyed? What remains to be conveyed? *** The proposal for talks from Imran Khan came less than a month after he became Pakistan's PM. In his first speech after his victory, he had made a similar pitch. The proposal also comes at a time when Pakistan's economy is crumbling, and the US has stated clearly that it is in no mood to approve any bailout by the International Monetary Fund, and in August   worth $300 million. Pakistan's PM and foreign minister have gone on record to say that the country is almost bankrupt. As a promising leader, who demonstrates traits of Western exposure as well as shades that find approval in Pakistan's conservative sections, Imran Khan, after assuming office, had to project a statesman's image to different audiences - in the West, in Pakistan, in India and elsewhere. An image that says: Look, here is a 'modern' leader who intends to do good and have peace; a leader who can rise above the mundane and see beyond the foggy horizon.  The proposal for talks provided him the perfect opportunity to do this. In 2014, after becoming India's PM, Modi did the same. On May 27, 2014, on his first day in office as India's PM,  in New Delhi for talks. Modi had invited him and other SAARC leaders for his swearing-in ceremony. Sharif described the meeting as ""good and constructive"" and something that can be built upon. India's former foreign secretary Sujatha Singh said Modi has accepted an invitation to travel to Pakistan, but the date is yet to be decided. A year-and-a-half later, in December 2015,   on his birthday, greeted and hugged him — projecting an image, of course, along with some message delivery. Like Imran Khan in 2018, Modi could do this in 2014 and 2015. He had just won a historic mandate. He needed to show to the world that he too is a statesman — exotic stuff like peace, talks, shared future et al.  In 2018, he can't do the same. He won't do it even if he wants to. Reason? Five Assembly elections, followed by the 2019 Lok Sabha election, are banging at his door. *** The decision to cancel the foreign ministers' meet, especially after announcing it in the first place, was clearly an afterthought. It was a decision taken with the upcoming elections in mind. Since the terror attack on the Pathankot airbase, the Modi government (and the BJP) has maintained that talks with Pakistan can be held only if Islamabad takes concrete actions against terrorists based in Pakistan and acting against India. Had Modi gone ahead with the foreign ministers' meet in New York, the BJP would have found itself in a tight spot for compromising on its stand. Not only would the Opposition use it to score political points, its own ally — the Shiv Sena — would have attacked it, as it has done on multiple occasions in the past four years.  Modi realises that September 2018 is not a politically auspicious month for him to again prove his statesmanship. He knows that this projection can wait for another 10 months because the task at hand for him is to ensure that he continues to be India's PM after May 2019. Does Imran Khan not know about this? He is smart, he surely does. Why did he then send the proposal when he knew that Modi is headed for key elections? Don't be naïve. Doesn't he need to address his own constituency back home? This explains the entire political tamasha that we saw last week. The proposal, its acceptance, its overnight rejection, call for action against Pakistan, and a counter threat of nukes. In the end, Imran Khan scored his points, Modi his. Both gained arguments to support their decisions. Both are victors in their own right for their own audiences. Who cares about anything else? Was the end result known already? Yes. Maybe no. Take your pick. The two PMs are dancing on the same song, exhibiting similar moves.",2018-09-26,"Nuclear Weapons,Narendra Modi,Imran Khan,India-Pakistan talks",The real reason why Imran Khan made an offer for dialogue and then called Modi a 'small man',https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-pakistan-talks-imran-khan-narendra-modi-nuclear-weapons-pakistan-shiv-sena/story/1/26892.html
169,Yashee,"Three UP police personnel have been suspended after a video of them slapping and abusing a girl  on social media. The cops had “rescued” the girl from a mob of men, some from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, who had been beating her and her classmate, a Muslim man, up.   
 
 In the video, the police do not seem to be behaving too differently from the VHP men. One of the cops sneeringly asks the girl: “  (So you like a Muslim? Even though so many Hindus are around?)…” followed by obscenities. A woman police personnel sitting beside the girl slaps her repeatedly, and yanks off the scarf she had used to cover her face with. 
 
 Welcome to the new normal. Where bullies can use an imagined grievance to humiliate and attack people, where the rights of choice and the privacy of two young people mean nothing, where the dignity of the disempowered — women, minorities, the young — is at the mercy of the powerful’s whims and fancies. And where the police and the goons seemingly share the same mentality.   The video that went viral on social media and eventually led to the cops' suspension was recorded and circulated by the cops themselves. Why did they feel the need to treat the girl like that — and record it on camera? What glory did they find in harassing a powerless girl they were supposedly protecting? The simple answer: they did it for kicks. Because in the times we live in, a girl seen to be dating a Muslim boy is fair game to be harassed, insulted, dehumanised. Where such conduct is cause for not shame, but pride. Where communal hatred has been normalised to such an extent that the lines between right and wrong have been blurred, even for those whose duty it is to uphold what is right.   For this, much of the blame lies at the doors of our political class. The BJP, as it slips up on the “vikas” front of its promises, is ramping up the communal rhetoric. The Congress, busy fine-tuning its own product of “soft Hindutva” and it wishes to outrage over, lacks the moral authority, and seemingly, even the intent, to de-vitiate the discourse. In the Meerut case, according to reports, the men who had barged into the Muslim man’s apartment created a spectacle of their “bravery”, beating up the couple publicly, creating a hue and cry over “love jihad”, and  . In our society, these photographs can give these men lasting power over the couple and their families. These goons should have been taken into custody immediately, their phones checked, all photos and videos deleted.   Instead, the police chose to take the couple to the police station, on the way, administering their own dose of moral policing. Their parents were called, and the girl’s father pressured to file a complaint against the Muslim man. The two students were allowed to return home only after the  lodge a complaint.    Communal polarisation was not invented in 2014. Women who chose to fall in love before marriage, within or outside their community, always had a tough time at the hands of the self-appointed custodians of community honour. But, in the last few years, such a mentality and such statements have been normalised, institutionalised and celebrated at an unprecedented scale.    We have MLAs and MPs coming up with  , and their party top brass not condemning them. We have politicians   the accused in communal crimes. We have seen the justice system   to favour certain shades of accused. In April,     that instances of hate speech went up by 500% in the four years of the Narendra Modi government. As many as  in the country have cases of hate speech against them. Almost half of them — 27 — belong to the BJP. When people in power start vocalising the prejudices you perhaps always held but only spoke out loud in small, close gatherings, you get the sanction to publicly state — and practise — them. When people get a taste of what it is to let their baser instincts run riot without consequences, it is difficult to rein them back in. Thus, we now have parties trying to out-Right the BJP. In UP itself, we have the  , which wants to field Shambhulal Regar, accused in the  , and Rupendra Rana, an accused in the Dadri lynching case, as candidates.      An interview with gaurakshaks  had the men saying they were “not afraid of Modi” and would “continue with their mission”, despite the PM condemning them. The disempowered in this country — women, the minorities, the young — have a powerful ally, the Indian Constitution, which mandates that everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. But the law is as effective as the people implementing it. The Meerut police moral-schooling the 20-year-old girl were doing so either because they were convinced they were right — they have heard political leaders, including   decry love jihad from the pulpits, they have read WhatsApp messages telling them of this “massive conspiracy” against Hindus — or because they knew they could get away with it — they see elected MPs and MLAs get away with worse. These three cops have been suspended, and an enquiry ordered against them. But what of the cases that don’t make it to social media or news outlets?

170,Javed Anwer,"Do you know that even before today's  , citing or providing an Aadhaar number wasn't mandatory in most cases? It wasn't mandatory for a bank account or a mobile phone number. It wasn't needed — at least the government never said so — for admission of children in private schools or colleges. It wasn't mandatory to enter the airport or get an insurance policy. Even for welfare services, like availing a subsidy from the government, it was required, but here too the courts had asked agencies not to deny benefits to those who absolutely needed it. Yet, everywhere, you were asked for your Aadhaar number - and almost everywhere, most people ended up giving it. Not giving an Aadhaar number was an invitation to face massive harassment, even though you knew you were right in refusing to share the details. This, chances are, is not going to change. Ours is not a country without rules. It's not the Wild Wild West. But India is also a country where, on the ground, the rules are bent at will, and before someone somewhere enforces the rules, it is often too late. Example: Can cops beat up people at will? No, but they do it anyway. So, coming back at the question of Aadhaar: chances are you will still be asked for your Aadhaar number and while, in most cases, it is not going to be mandatory to provide it, if you don't do so, you will again face the kind of harassment that you have faced in the last two years. Just by holding up the validity of Aadhaar and by allowing it to exist, the Supreme Court has kept it open to misuse. In fact, even as it struck down a number of Aadhaar provisions, there are some key ones that the court has upheld. And these key provisions will ensure that almost everyone in India will have to get Aadhaar. After the five-judge Supreme Court bench decision today, Aadhaar will continue to be ""mandatory"" to avail of government subsidy. This means that almost every instance where you will get some government subsidy — think monthly ration or treatment in a government hospital — you will be asked to produce your Aadhaar number. But what if you don't avail a subsidy? Even in that case, by upholding Clause 139AA of Income Tax, which makes it mandatory for Indians to cite an Aadhaar number to get a PAN card or to file income tax, the Supreme Court has ensured that you will have to get the Aadhaar number. And because Indians will have to get an Aadhaar number, and because it will continue to be pushed into our lives by the government, there is a strong chance that you will have to produce it again and again to get this service or that. There are many ways the government and private organisations — even after the Supreme Court has struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act — can push for Aadhaar. Just because Aadhaar exists and is now certified by the Supreme Court, you may expect various government bodies to come out with new guidelines that may (again) make it mandatory for a number of services. The Supreme Court has struck down the PMLA Rules that asked banks to link accounts with Aadhaar numbers, or the Department of Telecom (DoT) order that called for linking of mobile numbers with Aadhaar. But if the government is insistent on having its way, the finance ministry or DoT may come out with new directives or rules that will essentially again force people to share their Aadhaar number to get a SIM card or a bank account. Such moves will be daring on the part of the government, and they will probably fall in grey areas — but there is nothing that stops the government agencies from pushing for it. More significantly, various government agencies as well as private companies like Airtel and Paytm may continue to demand Aadhaar details as preferred IDs. They won't make it mandatory but they can make it difficult to use any other ID for verification purposes. For example, already it is possible for people to get a passport without supplying Aadhaar details. But if they give an Aadhaar number, the hassle is less and the whole process is easier. That is deliberate, even though UIDAI, the agency that looks after Aadhaar, has again and again said that Aadhaar should not be considered an ID. The challenge in India has always been to apply rules on the ground. We are not a mobocracy — but mobs do lynch and kill people. People have freedom of speech and freedom of expression — but on the ground, in Indian villages and towns, expressing your right to free speech or expression may lead you to getting a sound thrashing. Just by allowing Aadhaar to continue and deeming it constitutionally valid, the Supreme Court has ensured that people in India may continue facing Aadhaar tyranny. The dissent by Justice DY Chandrachud in today's verdict recognises the perils of Aadhaar well. He sees it for what it is: a fraud on the Constitution and a tool that can be used for massive surveillance. That is why he recommends scrapping it. The larger bench, sadly, didn't agree with him.",2018-09-26,"Data Privacy,Right to Privacy,UIDAI,Aadhaar",Aadhaar loses its teeth after SC verdict but it will still bite you because we are Indians,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aadhaar-right-to-privacy-data-protection-uidai-supreme-court-dipak-misra/story/1/26895.html
171,Nelanshu Shukla,"Hoardings and posters addressing Congress chief Rahul Gandhi as "" "" and a rousing welcome from a group of Kanwariyas with a chant of ""bum bum bhole"". This is how he was welcomed in his Parliamentary constituency Amethi when he returned from the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.  The Congress chief also greeted them and offered prayers at a Lord Shiva portrait. Mr Gandhi was seen posing with chandan on his head while he was welcomed by a crowd chanting ""Shiv bhakt"" at multiple places in his constituency. Preparations were already made last week to deck the Congress chief's constituency to propagate his inclination towards Lord Shiva.  During the Kailash Mansarovar yatra, Rahul had tweeted Sanskrit shlokas and the Upanishads to rebut the allegations made by BJP leaders over his pilgrimage tour.  He had also tweeted a post which said that a ""man goes to Kailash when it calls him."" Gandhi's words – about Kailash calling a person – were a throwback to something Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in 2014 during the election campaign then. The party which has always pitched for a secular approach is now making all efforts to prove that Rahul is a ""Shiv bhakt"". Starting from the Congress chief tweeting pictures of Mansarovar lake to other party leaders posting his pictures with pilgrims, the Congress has been prompt to respond to each and every attack of the BJP. A Lucknow-based Hindu priest Acharya Mohit Shukla said, ""We cannot predict what brews in a politicians mind but the sudden ''soft Hindutva'' approach of the Congress party raises suspicion. Earlier, the party used to talk only about secularism — but now Rahul's spree of temple visits and posing with chandan on his head leaves many unanswered questions.""  Speaking to  , Acharya Pramod Krishnam said, ""Since freedom, our political parties have focused on religion-based politics to consolidate their votes. While other political parties emphasised secularism, it was only the BJP which projected a strong Hindutva image by batting for the Ram Mandir, cow protection and cleaning of river Ganga. After losing the 2014 elections badly, the Congress party has realised that 'Hindutva' is needed to derail BJP from power. As all his   during the Gujarat and Karnataka polls and the recent Kailash Mansarovar Yatra showed, Rahul Gandhi has understood that a soft Hindutva push is mandatory to revive the party. This requires a lot of political courage."" A temple seer in Amethi's Gauriganj, Bhawani Dutt Dixit, however, raised questions on the Kanwariyas welcoming Rahul Gandhi on his two-day visit.  ""Rahul Gandhi should realise that the Kanwar Yatra takes places during the ""Sawan"" month. The way Kanwariyas were called to welcome him at his Lok Sabha constituency when the month of sawan is over clearly shows his lack of knowledge about the Hindu faith. We have not seen him visiting temples in Amethi before — this shows that his soft Hindutva image is just a political gimmick,"" Dixit said.  Starting from his Hindu tilt while visiting the Kedarnath Temple in Uttarakhand ahead of the Gujarat elections in 2017 to the recently concluded Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and a welcome by Kanwariyas in Amethi ahead of 2019 polls, many believe that Rahul's ""Shiv bhakti"" message is turning into a farce and it's just being done for electoral gains. It is also clear that Mr Gandhi – if not directly – is somehow using Hindutva as an important game plan to counter the BJP in the upcoming polls. The Congress chief has also apparently realised that through Hindutva, the BJP was able to outflank his party in the 2014 elections and the victory juggernaut continued in other state elections. He has finally understood that to strengthen the organisation, a soft Hindutva approach is needed and it's required to convert the BJP's strength into their weakness ahead of 2019 polls. However, with a new makeover, it has now become equally important and challenging for Mr Gandhi to create a balance, so that minorities who largely support Congress are not turned off by his new ""Shiv Bhakt"" avatar.",2018-09-24,"Narendra Modi,BJP,Congress,Shiv bhakt",Why Rahul Gandhi's Shiv bhakti is turning into a farce,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rahul-gandhi-soft-hindutva-shiv-bhakt-congress-bjp-narendra-modi/story/1/26864.html
172,Brig SK Chatterji (retd),"The Bhutanese preliminary election to the National Assembly recently sprung quite an unexpected surprise. The ruling party has been mauled in the preliminary stages itself. It stands third among the parties that had contested. For the country, the transition to democracy has been a peaceful process guided by the Bhutanese monarchy. Starting with a mock election to acquaint the citizens with the electoral process in 2007, Bhutan will now hold the third general election in its history. The Bhutanese people will now elect 47 members to the National Assembly or the Lower House that provides the executive political leadership. The National Council (Upper House) has 20 seats of which 15 are elected and five nominated by the King. The elections are conducted in two phases. In the preliminary phase, the registered parties field their candidates. Based on the results of the preliminaries, only the two topmost parties go through to the second round of polling to decide the winners in the Assembly. The Bhutanese people went through the preliminary round on September 17, 2018. The ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) led by PM Tshering Tobgay was left behind by the Druk Nyamrup Tshogpa (DNT) and also the Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party (Druk Phuensum Tshogpa or DPT). As such, the next and final round will be between DNT & DPT. DNT is led by Lotay Shering, a surgeon, who has won popularity with his promise of better healthcare. The party is not in the National Assembly as of now. In the preliminaries it has won in 16 constituencies. DPT has 15 members in the current Assembly based on the 2013 election results. Of interest to both India and China and the larger canvas of south and Southeast Asian nations would be the leanings of the new man who will become the PM once the electoral process is completed in October, 2018. Keeping the   between the Indian and Chinese armies in view, the leanings of the Bhutanese PM are crucial. China has a   with Bhutan that includes Doklam and a few more areas. The Chinese have reportedly offered Bhutan other areas in exchange of approximately 100sqkm at Doklam. As per the old Indo-Bhutanese Agreement of 1949 Bhutan was to be guided by India in regard to its external relations. The treaty signed in 2007 lays down that the two governments will cooperate with each other on issues relating to National Interests. PM Tshering Tobgay and his party were with India during the Doklam standoff. The Bhutanese government had given a statement clearly stating that the Chinese were on Bhutanese territory. Bhutanese politics, despite the transition to democracy, respects the monarchy heavily. For India, this is a major pivot to ensure continuity in India-Bhutan relations and mutually arrived at geo-political stances. However, notwithstanding the monarchy’s pre-eminence it would be better for India to start communicating with both the DNT & DPT leadership immediately. Whatever be the results of the final polls, both parties will be there in the Assembly to chart Bhutan’s policies. A change in guard at Thimphu does not necessarily mean a pro-China tilt, however, it could lead to Bhutan trying to pursue a more equated relationship with both India and China. So far, the New Delhi influence has been pre-dominant. Bhutan has supported the Indian stance on most issues except for a few affirmations of independent strategic policy making on a few occasions. The very fact that the Friendship Treaty had to be redrafted is an illustration of the faith and bonding between the two nations having been diluted.   India needs to retain its primacy in Bhutan’s foreign policy priorities, more so since it has lost a lot of ground in Nepal to the Chinese. The Chinese will offer greater funding than Indians can afford but Bhutan may not be looking for huge investments. It has propagated the concept of Gross National Happiness Index over that of GDP, to the whole world. Recently, they declined to ratify the Bhutan-Bangladesh-India-Nepal Motor Vehicles Agreement. Such a connectivity was a major plank for "" "" and ""Neighbourhood First"" policies to be translated into facilitating projects between the South Asian countries. The reasons advanced by Bhutan are the reservations of a section of its population on environmental grounds. As such, huge Chinese investments shouldn’t be Bhutan’s priority. The country and its people are not focused on rapid industrialisation. However, Bhutanese youth, like young people globally, has higher aspirations and needs jobs. With our longstanding relationship with Bhutan, the Indian focus needs to be on contributing in areas that affect the populace more and in areas that are a priority for the man on the street. Such issues include education, healthcare, agriculture, development of the tourism industry. India already purchases hydropower from Bhutan and is committed to constructing additional hydropower projects in Bhutan. In fact, sale of power to India is Bhutan’s biggest foreign exchange earner. India-Bhutan relationship has a huge ancient cultural linkage which needs to be leveraged. The revered Guru Padmasambhava associated with Vajrayana Buddhism that has a huge following in Bhutan was from India. The Indian approach to Bhutan has necessarily to be tailored while being sensitive to the growing Bhutanese aspirations of being considered as an equal. The Bhutanese will also be loathed to be considered as just a pawn in the great game between India and China. In the years ahead, their aspirations to have an independent strategic opinion as a sovereign state will recur more often. Obviously, they will need to be treated as equals and as such integrated economically to ensure a better balance in mutual trade.",2018-09-24,"Xi Jinping,BJP,Narendra Modi,Doklam",Why Bhutan's 2018 general election results could concern India,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhutan-thimphu-china-doklam-narendra-modi-bjp-xi-jinping/story/1/26862.html
173,Saif Ullah Khan,"BJP President Amit Shah has said Bangladeshi migrants are   who would soon be struck off the electoral rolls. Speaking at an election rally in Rajasthan's Sawai Madhopur, Shah credited the BJP government with publishing the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam and identifying nearly 40 lakh illegal immigrants. That these people have a recourse to appeal, and get their named added to the NRC, did not find mention in the speech. Shah gladly painted everyone in the list as 'illegal'. On Sunday, speaking at the Purvanchal Mahakumbh organised by the Delhi unit of the party at the Ramlila Ground, Shah said the BJP will ensure all the illegal immigrants living in the country are identified if it comes to power in 2019 Lok Sabha Elections. Shah also asked that Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal come clean on the issue and alleged that   for vote bank politics. Firstly, Assam's NRC was a Supreme Court mandated exercise - when the BJP chief tries taking credit for it at an election rally, he is himself pandering to vote bank politics. Secondly, while there is nothing wrong in identifying illegal immigrants in the country, the language used by Shah is problematic. Surrounded by neighbours like Pakistan, with a known penchant of promoting cross-border terrorism and age-old hostility towards India, China, flexing its muscles at several borders areas like Doklam, Bangladesh has shared quite an amicable relationship with the country. Right from the start of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's term, New Delhi's relationship with the Sheikh Hasina government has been quite warm, with India and Bangladesh   in June 2015, fixing the contours of the 4,000 km India-Bangladesh border and putting an end to the 41-year-old border dispute. With no official sanction to speak on the India-Bangladesh relationship, Shah has risked antagonising a friendly neighbour in one fell swoop. And, predictably, they are not too pleased with this. Bangladesh Information Minister   has said that Amit Shah has made an unwarranted remark in calling Bangladeshis 'termites'. He said Shah was not qualified to speak on the matter and Home Minister Rajnath Singh had already assured Dhaka that people excluded from Assam's NRC exercise would not be sent to his country. So, what was Amit Shah trying to achieve by making a statement that was bound to irk Bangladesh? Election strategy, not foreign policy, seems to be the most probable answer. With the Modi government on the backfoot with issues like the Rafale deal, price rise, jobs and economic growth, what better than a dose of jingoism to deflect the attention of the voters towards nationalistic pastures? With the Opposition alleging crony capitalism, PM's chief strategist has chosen to risk India's relationship with Dhaka for another shot at the centre in 2019. With Rajasthan going to polls by the end of the year, the BJP knows the position of the incumbent CM Vasundhara Raje is not too conducive for another term. Faced with a resurgent Congress in Rajasthan, under the stewardship of Sachin Pilot, BJP is finding it hard to fight back. Shah's statements about carrying out a national exercise to identify illegal immigrants has already been echoed by several BJP leaders in the past. What seems to be lost on these politicians is the   Assam's NRC has turned out to be, with some people from the same family finding mention and some not appearing in the list. Even some family members of former President   failed to make the cut. The logistics required to carry out an exercise of such magnitude would require enormous resources – but who cares about minor details when speeches and slogans are apparently enough to get votes. Taking pot shots at political opponents is fine, but to allege that all these are illegal immigrants and   could inadvertently turn out to be a call to violence against some of its own citizens. Given the abysmally low number of people India has actually   in the last few years, the intention of Shah's speech is quite obvious. With some of its leaders showing a penchant for a foot in mouth predilection, BJP as the ruling party will have to decide what's more important – another term at the centre or lowering the discourse further in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections.",2018-09-24,"Lok Sabha elections 2019,Assam nrc list,Bangladeshi immigrants,Amit Shah","Amit Shah calls illegal Bangladeshis termites.

174,Manoj Joshi,"Shinzo Abe’s   means that he can expect to head the government till the next election is due in late 2021, when he would have been the country’s longest serving prime minister. In achieving his victory, Abe has overcome powerful headwinds, which include domestic political scandals, a persistently sluggish economy and an unpredictable Trump in the White House. Japan is an important economic and political partner of India. Its low-interest loans are invaluable for India’s infrastructure. They are helping connectivity projects across the country and their assistance in urban development schemes is transforming the landscape in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. New Delhi and Tokyo have a robust relationship across the Indo-Pacific and are collaborating on the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor to provide a high-quality alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative in the Indian Ocean Region. When Abe took office for the second time in 2012, the stagnant economy was Japan’s only major problem. He had declared that he had three arrows in his arsenal to fix it — monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms. Since then, in the face of rising problems with the US and China, Abe has achieved a great deal, but he needs to do much, much more to ensure that Japan can meet the economic and political challenges it confronts. His expansionary economic strategy has brought back a measure of growth in the otherwise stagnant Japanese economy. It may not be much by global standards, but it is the strongest since the 1990s. He has used his office to push Japan’s security perimeter beyond the bounds to which it is confined by the constitution and he has initiated structural reforms aimed at raising the retirement age, scrapping tax rules that encourage women to keep away from the workforce and make the wealthy pay for their own health care. The arrival of Donald Trump in the White House added a headache that need not have been there. Abe has gone out of his way to work with Trump, but the latter has not quite reciprocated. In his dealings with North Korea, Trump has often ignored Japanese interests. The US is extremely important to Japan as a trade partner and security provider. But the US has challenged Japan in both these areas. Trump famously walked away from the patiently negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would have been greatly beneficial to Japan. Now, one of the short-term risks to the Japanese economy is the tariffs Trump has threatened to put on imported cars and car parts. Japan may have to make concessions to the US on this score and we may see some action when Trump meets Abe at the sidelines of the UNGA in New York this week. Abe needs some skillful footwork in dealing with his problems. On trade, he has joined 11 nations of the Pacific littoral to give life to an alternative to the TPP and, at the same time, has reached out to the EU to create one of the world’s largest liberalised trade zones. The Trump factor has encouraged Abe to reach out to both China and Russia. His October visit to China is expected to normalise ties between the two East Asian neighbours after a decade of tension. Trump may have dampened the Japan-China tensions, but they are not going to go away so easily. But if Abe is able to successfully fire his third arrow to restructure the Japanese economy, it can have a transformative impact not only in Japan, but the rest of Asia as well. Among his most difficult problems he still confronts are to find ways of dealing with Japan’s shrinking workforce. The Japanese are notoriously allergic to immigrants and at the same time, they are reluctant to allow women into their workforce. Yet, with its shrinking population, Japan desperately needs additional hands to power its economy. Another significant domestic issue is his pledge to revise the Japanese constitution to make it clear that Japan’s military is legal. Currently, Article 9 of the Constitution bars Japan from maintaining “land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential”, though the country maintains de facto ‘Self Defence Forces’. Neither of these two problems will be easy to resolve since there remains significant political resistance to change, especially that in relation to the pacifist Constitution.

175,Ali Salman Andani,"Those who voted for Prime Minister Imran Khan now feel shocked having observed all the “ ” (change) that he has brought to the country since assuming office. He ran his election campaign against the ruling elite and “godfathers” of the country, who corrupted the system for their personal benefits — which made the underprivileged classes of the country suffer. People don’t get justice, the poor can’t afford to eat two square meals a day, illiteracy is surging, human rights are being violated, the economy is collapsed, the health sector is devastated, malnutrition continues to affect millions of children across the country, politicians rob the national treasury, big businessmen and political elite — to avoid paying taxes — launder money using offshore companies, nepotism, favouritism and bribes have fractured meritocracy, and so on. These were the claims made by the “  clown” Imran Khan, who can now be seen busy in auctioning PM House vehicles and buffalos to show off fake austerity moves. All this, while he uses a state-owned helicopter to travel from the PM Secretariat to Bani Gala, a trip which costs around (Pakistani) Rs 1,28,000 of the taxpayers’ money — just one way! Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, while speaking to a local television channel, defended the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief’s use of the helicopter, saying that “the average cost is about Rs 50-55 per kilometre”, but soon,   revealed the approximate cost of travelling 15km in a chopper, as   by  . His voters did not expect him to indulge in nepotism, favouritism and cronyism. Unfortunately, however, Imran Khan   to pay back those who invested in his election campaign — return on investments, after all, is important! In that spirit, he issued orders to appoint   — “a close aide of him” — as special assistant to the premiere on overseas Pakistanis and human resource development. Bukhari was also given status as a minister of state. All this, while Bukhari is being investigated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), in connection with establishing offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands. A friend of PM Imran Khan, Bukhari is a British Passport holder and enjoys dual nationality. Shamelessly still, another special assistant to PM,   came forward, defending Khan’s decision to bless Zulfi Bukhari with a powerful position in his government. While talking to media, Durrani said Bukhari is a respected citizen who has the required credentials to execute the job. When asked why an individual undergoing an NAB inquiry was given the position, Durrani maintained that Bukhari was being persecuted with allegations moved by the previous government. Mr Durrani conveniently forgets that it was his party that, prior to the elections, shouted about ending nepotism in the government. Not just that, Khan in his campaigning also asked — on many occasions — to kick those facing charges and investigations out of administrative positions in the government. “ ” (All preach, no practice.) Criticising Bukhari’s appointment, former PTI leader Fauzia Kasuri took to Twitter and   that she had surrendered her US citizenship in 2013 to contest an intra-party election. Before getting sworn in as Prime Minister, Imran Khan, on several occasions, criticised former governments (PML-N and PPP) for apparently needlessly swelling the cabinet by awarding close ones with ministries and others (non-elected friends) as special assistants and advisors. With the induction of Zulfi Bukhari and Ali Mohammad Khan, Khan’s cabinet strength has already been swelled to 32. It is not only Zulfi Bukhari who is enjoying  . Naeemul Haq, who has had a long personal association with Imran Khan and has been a regular feature at Bani Gala for years, is already serving Prime Minister Imran Khan as his political advisor. Haq also enjoys the status of a state minister. Ehsan Mani, another friend of Imran Khan, has been appointed chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Zakir Khan, who is also on the list of close friends, has also been made the PCB director for international cricket. It is worth noting that Khan, once upon a time,   the former PM Nawaz Sharif for appointing his close ones in the PCB. Hypocrisy at its peak! I don’t see meritocracy prevailing in Imran Khan’s government at all. By no means is the selection of Sardar Usman Buzdar as Chief Minister of Punjab justifiable. While Khan announced his name as a radical move to bring an ""unknown"" politician from an underprivileged background and from a backward part of the province to power, Buzdar’s father is a tribal chieftain, and has been a member of the Punjab Assembly in the past. In fact, Buzdar was elected   from Taunsa during the Musharraf regime and was also affiliated with the PML-N in past. Perhaps, Imran Khan was unable to find a reasonable and experienced person for the position. Thus he chose Buzdar — who has not only faced allegations of corruption, but also even complicity in  — in the past. "" ."" (The funeral of merit). Because my favourite part is the economy, I won’t end without discussing the “mini-budget” which Finance Minister Asad Umar presented in Parliament on Tuesday. Rather than providing more incentives to taxpayers, the government lifted the ban on non-taxpayers from acquiring cars and land. Rent-seeking is obvious. Society will bear a huge deadweight loss. But who cares for society? Furthermore, the bill proposed an increase in withholding tax on non-cash banking transaction for non-filers, a step that will promote hand to hand money transfer. To increase the burden on the already suffering citizens, on Monday, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet allowed a raise in   for domestic consumers in the range of 10 per cent for the lowest slab consumers to 143 per cent for the highest slab domestic consumers. CNG prices for consumers in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been increased by 40 per cent from Rs 700/mmbtu to Rs 980/mmbtu. A crippling economy, suffering citizens and surging nepotism and cronyism; Imran Khan made many promises — all apparently to lure people into voting for PTI and bringing him to power. He should, however, keep in mind that neither does auctioning cars and buffalos, and leasing-out the historic building hosting state-run radio, Radio Pakistan HQ, located in Islamabad’s Red Zone (to generate funds for a  ) look like austerity measures when one wastes tax payers money on helicopter rides; nor it will ease the country’s financial sufferings. It is just a waste of time! Lastly, a word to the Minister of Human Rights, Dr Shireen Mazari, who expressed grave concerns over   of Muslim citizens in some European states during a meeting with a delegation of the European Union, headed by Jean-François Cautain, the Ambassador of the European Union in Pakistan.

176,David Frawley,"Pakistan is the modern world’s most active and enduring ""jihadi state"". As Gaurav C Sawant notes, “Terror is in the DNA of Pakistan.” Pakistan has been engaged in a proxy war against India, starting with its inception in 1947, as a means of justifying its very existence. 
 
 Initially, Pakistan-sponsored terrorism was only directed against India to justify a military dominance of the country through an appeal to fundamentalist Islam. In recent decades, Pakistan-sponsored attacks have gone global. Most post-9/11 terrorists, apparently, have had their training in Pakistan and many are Pakistanis. Osama Bin Laden was captured and killed while hiding near a Pakistan military base — hardly a coincidence. Prior to 9/11, Pakistan created the Taliban and set up the Taliban state of Afghanistan from which Osama acted and spread his Al Qaeda terrorist network worldwide. ISIS is also reportedly finding new refuge and support in Pakistan today. In this context, Imram Khan, Pakistan’s new Prime Minister, is asking for a new dialogue and new peace talks with India. Yet, Khan won the recent elections with the blatant “support” of the Pakistan army and 'jihadi'  . He campaigned on an agenda of military strength and aggression, not as a candidate for peace. Why then does Imran Khan want peace talks with India? Is it a sincere desire for peace that motivates him? No one would be so naive as to believe that. The latest Pakistani request for peace talks is a mere public relations ploy aimed at foreign governments — particularly Europe and the USA — hoping to reduce Pakistan’s negative image as a 'terrorist state'. Certainly, many groups in the West that have supported Pakistan in the past would like to see such a change in Pakistan’s policy.   It is also an economic ploy to make possible investment in Pakistan seem more acceptable and reliable. It is aimed at Islamic countries and China to make their defending of Pakistan interests at a diplomatic level more viable. In addition, Khan can use it to try to bring back the Indo-Pak equivalence in foreign affairs, which has been lost to the Af-Pak terrorist equation. Imran Khan’s gesture has nothing to do with seeking peace, but is a continued effort to keep Pakistan afloat and hide the terrorist forces that remain boldly active in the country today. It does not involve any effort to rein in terrorism, or to reduce the military control of the country. World-designated terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar roam freely in Pakistan and influence and  . Not surprisingly, Khan has lambasted India as “arrogant and negative” for not agreeing to this sham of talks. Yet, Pakistan’s connection with terrorism is so enduring and extensive that no country in the world can ignore it. Khan has also reportedly said that Pakistan will defend Saudi Arabia — though Saudi regularly expels thousands of Pakistani workers for possible criminal or terrorist involvement. As the increased Pakistani violence in Kashmir indicates, there is no real change of heart in Pakistan. Pakistan in the past has returned India’s peace proposals with terrorist attacks and military assaults — and is clearly hoping to do so again. The poison of 'jihad' has crippled Pakistan. It cannot be removed unless Pakistan is willing to question its religious and military identity as a 'jihadi state', which would bring into doubt the very rationale for its existence. Many Indians look at Pakistan like a brother gone astray. Pakistanis look at Indians as 'mortal enemies' that must be removed at all cost, even if they have to be stabbed in the back. This may sound harsh, but it is the fact of history that cannot be brushed aside. India’s long-standing misplaced sympathy for the people of Pakistan has only emboldened Pakistan further, it has justified it in the eyes of the world, and it has weakened India’s resolve to counter Pakistan aggression. After seventy years and all that has transpired from Indo-Pak wars to the genocide of Kashmiri Pandits, such sympathy has no place. Only a stern response can counter Pakistan’s terrorist mindset.",2018-09-23,"UNGA,Narendra Modi,India-Pak,Imran Khan","No, Pakistan does not want 'peace' with India",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-pakistan-unga-meet-called-off-imran-khan-s-dubious-intentions-behind-proposed-peace-talk/story/1/26835.html
177,Markandey Katju,"The Mayawati-Ajit Jogi   in Chattisgarh has, in my opinion, national significance, and it is fallacious to think of it as a BJP ploy. The tie-up indicates that the days of the domination of the two national parties, the Congress and the BJP, in national politics are over — now, it is the regional parties that are going to rule the roost in the days to come. One is reminded of the reign of the later Mughals after the death of the last strong Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, in 1707. These later Mughals were, in fact, phantom rulers, real power having passed into the hands of local regional satraps like Nizam ul Mulk and Safdar Jung, and the Nawabs of Avadh, Murshidabad, Arcot, etc.  The successor of Aurangzeb, his son, Bahadur Shah, who ruled from 1707-1712, became known as 'Shah-e-Bekhabar' because he did not know what was going on. After his death, the kingmakers, the Syed brothers, installed and deposed a series of emperors, until they were themselves put to death. From 1719-1749, the emperor was Muhammad Shah Rangila, and his name itself speaks volumes of his reign. His chief queen was having an affair with his chief eunuch Javed, and Delhi was sacked by Nadir Shah during his reign, about which it was said: ""Saltanat-e-Shah Alam, az Dilli ta Palam"" (i.e., the Empire of Shah Alam extends from Delhi to Palam). In all probability, after the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in May 2019, a coalition government will be formed at the Centre, like the Janata Party government after the  , and the real power will be with regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee, Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Tejaswi Yadav, Chandrababu Naidu, KCR, DMK, ADMK, Naveen Patnaik, Shiv Sena, etc., who will be the real powers behind the throne, the prime ministers only being their puppets, and being deposed every six months or so. There will be a scramble for lucrative portfolios — particularly the finance portfolio, as was witnessed after the Karnataka Assembly elections (because the bulk of the money lies there). Even thereafter, there will be constant bickering and quarrels between the coalition partners. And in the meantime, unemployment will keep rising, prices will keep soaring and the rupee will keep sinking. As farmers' distress keeps mounting, our politicians, like modern Neros, will keep fiddling while Rome burns. And thugs will roam the land like locusts, looting the public with impunity.

178,Amitabh Srivastava,"Everything — the timing, the venue, the person — seemed perfectly in place when ace poll strategist Prashant Kishor, the man credited for the electoral successes of Narendra Modi in 2014 and the JD(U)-RJD-Congress Grand Alliance in the 2015 Bihar Assembly election, decided to formally join the JD(U) on Sunday. The venue selected for the occasion was 1 Aney Marg, the chief minister’s official bungalow in Patna. And it was no one else but chief minister Nitish Kumar, JD(U) national president, who gave him the membership receipt, making it clear the poll strategist turned-politician will be placed high in the party’s pecking order. Having called Kishor ""the future"", Nitish has also indicated he will have a key role to play. The timing of Kishor joining the JD(U), just a few months before the 2019 Lok Sabha election, is of significance, too. Kishor, affectionately called PK by friends, is expected to play a similar role to the one he played prior to the 2015 Bihar assembly polls. In fact, in 2015, it seemed like a lost battle when Lalu joined hands with Nitish Kumar. The BJP juggernaut then threatened to steamroll everything that came its way. On the other hand, establishing a connection between a methodical Nitish and mercurial Lalu was anything but easy. But, Prashant achieved what seemed so difficult then. He took the entire election campaign to new levels, making the electorate realise why Nitish Kumar was heads and shoulders above the rest. Now, again with the Lok Sabha polls approaching, PK joining Nitish Kumar’s political team will give JD(U) the much-needed impetus both at political and strategy levels. A public health expert with the experience of having worked for United Nations earlier, Kishor is credited for devising innovating strategies such as ""chai pe charcha"" and 3D hologram campaign for Narendra Modi and Har Ghar Dastak for Nitish Kumar. Now, for a change, Kishor will be in a team that has both Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar together. On the eve of 2015 Bihar Assembly polls, the BJP, riding high on its Lok Sabha success, believed that given their inherent contradictions and acrimonious past, Nitish and Lalu would never be able to cobble a working partnership. But taking them by complete surprise, Prashant made the two work out a seamless seat-sharing deal where even the Congress, which held just four seats in the outgoing Assembly, was given 40 constituencies. In contrast, NDA allies Ram Vilas Paswan of the LJP and Jitan Ram Manjhi of HAM(S) squabbled over seats, while Upendra Kushwaha of the RLSP sulked. It delivered a message of incoherent NDA and the poll result, handing Nitish a massive victory, was a stamp on Prashant’s ability as a successful strategist. JD(U) leaders now assume PK’s induction will serve as a harbinger to many changes in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls. For instance, Kishor’s presence in JD(U) will give Nitish Kumar’s party the much-needed confidence to match ally BJP’s campaign skills and magnitude. “It can even be a factor during seat negotiations. With PK formally by our side, you can no longer dismiss our ground assessments as hearsay,” said a JD(U) leader. A few JD(U) leaders also believe PK’s induction will downsize some biggies in Nitish Kumar’s party. Kishor’s earlier innings with JD(U) during the 2015 Assembly election had seen many party stalwarts informally getting downgraded. One of the men who now run such a risk is JD(U) Rajya Sabha member RCP Singh, a virtual number two in the party. There is a general perception that Singh has failed to deliver as JD(U) strategist in the by-elections held this year. Some JD(U) leaders also have differences with him. A senior JD(U) leader, however, said that RCP will not be out of Nitish Kumar’s favour. Instead, the Bihar CM will take away some of the crucial jobs from him and let Kishor do them. RCP’s problem is that he has failed to finetune or revitalise the party apparatus despite being given enough years and opportunities. Now, it could be Kishor’s brief to rejuvenate the party.

179,Kiran Tare,"On September 19, Devendra Fadnavis became the longest serving non-Congress Chief Minister of Maharashtra, surpassing the 1,420-day tenure of Shiv Sena’s Manohar Joshi. I vividly remember the day Fadnavis was chosen as the leader of the BJP legislative party. He was sitting in a room with the then-Leader of Opposition Eknath Khadse and BJP leader Vinod Tawde. When I reached, Tawde requested Fadnavis to talk to the waiting reporters for a while, and then rejoin their meeting. Fadnavis came out of the room with a broad smile on his face. He reacted to his elevation to the CM’s post in a politically correct manner. Towards the end of the interaction, I asked him, “How much do you remember your late father today?” This question got him emotional. He put his hands on my shoulders and said, “I lost him when I was only 17. I will try to walk on the path he had laid down.” Today, Fadnavis is no longer an emotional being. He has acquired the identity of a ruthless and shrewd politician. In the past four years, he has succeeded in establishing himself as one of the tallest BJP leaders in Maharashtra, on whom the party can rely for winning elections. He recently announced in Nagpur that he would be the CM for another five years. Is this dream achievable? Here are eight key factors that could decide Fadnavis’ fortunes.   One of the flagship initiatives of the Fadnavis government has been a micro-irrigation scheme called the Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyaan (farms full of water). The government claims that the scheme has  , with around 6,000 villagers made free from water scarcity, and farmers getting adequate water for their crops. The scheme does have the potential to change the state’s rural economy, and political equations as well. But at the same time, farmers are not too happy with the government’s agricultural policies. In what Fadnavis calls a “historic decision”, the state has so far spent around Rs 18,000 crore   While the government claims that transparency in implementation has ensured that only genuine farmers get the benefit of the scheme, farmers are demanding a more flexible market and adequate rates for their produce. All three prominent communities in Maharashtra — the Other Backward Classes (OBC), the Marathas and the Scheduled Castes (SC) — have some or the other issues with the government. While the Marathas are aggressively demanding 16% reservation in government jobs and educational institutions, the OBCs want their quota of 27% to remain untouched. The SCs are demanding social security and appropriate representation in the government. So far, Fadnavis has adopted a strategy of consolidating OBC votes. He has formed a separate department for them and announced several perks, such as hostels for students and a review of the reportedly small representation of the community in government jobs. He has announced similar perks for the Marathas too. Fadnavis has also focused on tribals — for whom 25 Assembly seats have been reserved. Also, they have up to 20% votes in another 20 Assembly constituencies. If Fadnavis could improve the BJP’s tally from 15 to 25 in these constituencies, his chances of retaining office would be bright. Fadnavis’s thrust on creating infrastructure, in the form of new roads and metro rail corridors, will be the BJP’s trump card in urban areas. In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) alone, where there are 63 Assembly seats, the wide metro rail network will be a huge relief for the city’s 1.20 crore daily commuters. However, the pathetic condition of potholed roads, as well as traffic snarls in urban areas, will be reason too for him to worry. Urban voters will not take bad roads lightly.  That Fadnavis wants to be known as a ‘development man’ is evident from his pet project — the Nagpur-Mumbai Super Communication Expressway, popularly known as the Samruddhi Corridor. The 710-km super-highway, which is to connect the state capital with its second capital, has been mired in controversies since its inception, due to stiff opposition from landholders. Fadnavis  that the land owners’ opposition melted away after they were given compensation. However, nothing can be predicted till the work actually begins. In the past four years, Maharashtra has witnessed   per year against women. Around   are missing in Mumbai alone. Significantly, the home department under Fadnavis failed to gauge the mood of the people ahead of the Bhima-Koregaon anniversary early this year, which led to violence. This particular riot will have a long-lasting impact on the state’s social fabric. Fadnavis claims that the state’s crime detection rate has gone up from 8% to 40% in the past four years. However, his government has not been able to contain the rising graph of crimes. In stark contrast to his image as a mature politician, Fadnavis has not been able to establish himself as a taskmaster when it comes to his administration. The bureaucracy, especially lower-level officials, stands accused of not following their boss’s instructions. That the administration is not doing its job well is evident from the huge crowds that gather at the Mantralaya every day. If Fadnavis cannot get his administration in shape, he will have people blaming him for not doing enough for them, despite the sops he's offered various groups. One factor working in Fadnavis’s favour is the weak Opposition that the Congress and NCP make up. While the Opposition did raise several issues that could point to scams under the government, they miserably failed to capitalise on the explosive nature of the allegations. Also, Fadnavis is keen on inducting “influential” leaders from the NCP into the BJP. ‘Win at any cost’ is his formula for political maneuvering. The BJP exhibited   its power of breaking the NCP. Sources say that at least 20 local NCP councilors are in queue to join the BJP. Fadnavis is on good terms with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, but his personal relationship is at stake over constant friction in the Sena-BJP alliance. If Fadnavis can placate Thackeray, and have him firmly on his side, he will have an easier time in election rallies. A major factor that will work either in Fadnavis’s favour, or the other way round, is the frustration among BJP workers. These are the people who have kept patience for 15 years and worked very hard to expand the party in Maharashtra, but are now being neglected when important positions are allotted. Fadnavis does not like the word “imported leaders”, but the fact remains that most influential positions have been grabbed by those who joined the BJP after it came to power in 2014. If Fadnavis fails to contain this frustration among his party workers, his job in the next election will become much more difficult.",2018-09-21,,Fadnavis becomes longest serving non-Congress CM of Maharashtra: Can he win another term?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/devendra-fadnavis-maratha-quota-farmers-protest-maharashtra-bjp-congress/story/1/26800.html
180,M Reyaz,"On September 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Afghanistan's President Dr Ashraf Ghani in New Delhi over lunch. While no new announcement was made, Ghani’s visit is significant as it was aimed at reiterating commitments to “strategic partners and a valued neighbour”. The visit gains significance also because both PM Modi and Dr Ghani face elections in the next few months. If not postponed, the Afghanistan Parliament elections will be held in the next month itself, while the presidential elections are scheduled for April next year. This may thus be the last visit of Ghani during his first term in office. Dr Ghani arrived in Delhi on September 19 to brief India, and take into confidence Kabul’s all-weather friend and first strategic partner, on recent developments in the war-torn country, including peace talks with the Taliban. According to official communications, the discussion mainly revolved around India’s commitment to helping build a stable Afghanistan, the current security situation, recent initiatives with Taliban, and trade and commerce. ? Being president of a country like Afghanistan is not easy. Ghani has the arduous challenge of overseeing his nation’s transition from NATO-led security to Afghan forces taking control. That has also meant a huge cut in foreign aid. The shift has not been an easy one — in fact, casualties have reached a record high. In July, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) released its  , according to which the first half of the year witnessed 5,122 civilian casualties (1,692 people killed and 3,430 injured). The brief ceasefire during Eid-ul-Fitr had raised hopes of a durable peace, but since then, Afghanistan has witnessed several deadly attacks. On September 11, at least 68 people  and 165 injured when a suicide bomber detonated explosives in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar at a peaceful protest gathering. On September 5, twin bombings at a sports club in the capital, Kabul, killed at least 20 people and wounded 70 others. The most serious offensive in recent weeks was on the historical and strategically located city of Ghazni — known in India for Mahmud Ghaznavi, whose invasion led to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate at the end of 12th century. The  to the deaths of at least 70 Afghan police personnel, 20 civilians and 194 Taliban insurgents, although the actual number is believed to be many times higher. When Ghani assumed office of the President in 2014 as part of the deal with his rival, Dr Abdullah, in the National Unity Government, he tried his best in the initial months to make Pakistan believe in the long-term benefits of peace and stability. He visited Delhi quite late — in April 2015 — to dispel India’s concerns, and then  his vision of developing Afghanistan as a “roundabout”. Prime Minister Modi also visited Afghanistan twice, first to inaugurate the new building of the   in December 2015 that India helped build, and once again in June 2016 to inaugurate the multipurpose  , often regarded as the ‘Friendship Dam’ in Herat. While the high number of casualties is a major cause for concern now, the country has seen some positive developments recently as well. Most significant is the peace deal with former warlord and insurgent leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The elusive peace talks with the Taliban have been the blink-and-miss kind so far, but particularly after Eid, formal negotiations between US representatives and the Taliban began in Qatar. Russia too is on board in the negotiations with the Taliban. With the news of the death of Maulvi Jalaluddin Haqqani, a dreaded leader of a Taliban offshoot, Kabul will hope that there is some breakthrough before the presidential elections coming in April. Interestingly, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi made his first trip to Kabul last week, after the new government of Imran Khan assumed office in Islamabad. On Wednesday, PM Modi and Ghani in Delhi “reviewed and positively assessed the progress of the multi-faceted India-Afghanistan strategic partnership” at Hyderabad House, where the PM hosted the visitor. Aided by an air-freight corridor from Delhi and Mumbai, bilateral trade has crossed the US $1-billion mark. Last week, Mumbai witnessed a successful India-Afghanistan trade and investment show, from September 12-15. In Delhi, PM Modi “reiterated India's support to an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned, Afghan-controlled peace and reconciliation process that would enable Afghanistan to continue as a united, peaceful, inclusive and democratic nation and emerge as an economically vibrant country.” They hoped that once the Chabahar port in Iran becomes fully operational, trade with and via Afghanistan to larger Central Asia will grow manifold. India, Iran and Afghanistan recently held the first tri-partite meet in Kabul to deliberate on the fast completion of the port. Chabahar   for both India and Afghanistan.  Like Chabahar, the work on another connectivity project, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline, is on, and last month, MoS MJ Akbar  to take part in the ground-breaking ceremony for the Afghan section of the pipeline.  While speaking at a function in Delhi, the anthropologist-turned-politician Ghani pitched strongly for a peace deal with the Taliban, terming them “part of Afghan society”, and distinguishing them from Daesh or ISIS. Ghani also said that South Asia remains the least economically integrated region in the world, and hoped that we “overcome the past to create the near future”. He said that for thousands of years, the region symbolised connectivity, and hoped that Afghanistan serves as a “platform for regional and global cooperation and stability by once again becoming a roundabout (for trade)”. He thanked India for its contributions, most importantly in education and training, ending his speech with “Jai India, Jai Afghanistan”. Although Kabul is aware of New Delhi’s limitations, they expect greater military support from India. Immediate demands, according to reports, are at least four more helicopters. In 2015, India had gifted four helicopters to Kabul. Afghanistan’s envoy to Delhi, Dr Shaida Abdali, who dramatically resigned after serving six years in office even as Ghani was in town, earlier told  , “Afghanistan is going through a very critical time; therefore, the Afghan government needs to conduct strategic consultations with its strategic partners.” New Delhi, meanwhile, has confined itself to infrastructure development in the war-torn country. It has generally refrained from any aggressive military adventure that may raise suspicion in Pakistan. Nonetheless, India trains batches of military and police personnel, gives scholarships to over thousand Afghan students each year, and has helped build a dam, power stations, the parliament building, university, hospital, etc., in Afghanistan.  Such an approach has earned India unmatched respect and the goodwill of common Afghans as well as politicians. But Kabul expects New Delhi to be more forthcoming, and play a bigger role in the region, instead of sticking to textbook diplomacy.",2018-09-20,"Pakistan,Narendra Modi,Ashraf Ghani,India-Afghanistan ties","Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s visit: Kabul wants more from India, but will New Delhi take risks?",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/ashraf-ghani-delhi-visit-afghanistan-india-taliban-chabahar-port-pakistan/story/1/26777.html
181,Hamza Ameer,"History was made when the Supreme Court of Pakistan ousted a sitting Prime Minister, and made him step down on charges of corruption. Nawaz Sharif, who was then Prime Minister, saw his premiership taken away, followed by imprisonment of ten years in the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, along with eight years for his daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif, and one year for his son-in-law Captain (Retd.) Safdar, charged with corruption under the Avenfield reference, by the accountability court. The court’s verdict came as a massive loss for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Sharif family, as their rivals, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), led by cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, took this up as their success against what they called “struggle against the corrupt leaders”, resulting in a populous victory in the 2018 General Elections, making Imran Khan the country’s Prime Minister. While PML-N's future hung in the balance in an uncertain relationship with their coalition opposition parliamentary partners, the Pakistan People Party (PPP), the future for the Sharif family and their political party seemed bleak. When Nawaz’s wife,   breathed her last in London hospital on Eid, her husband and daughter were in Adiala jail. The trauma they went through was visible on the faces of the Sharif family as they were released on parole to attend the last rites of Kulsoom Nawaz in Jati Umra, Lahore. On Wednesday, the   ordered the immediate release of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's daughter Maryam Nawaz and son-in-law Captain (Retd.) Safdar, suspending the sentences they received from the accountability court earlier this year. The order came after a petition filed by the Sharif family lawyer, challenging the NAB court’s verdict. The court suspended the ten-year sentence for Nawaz Sharif, the seven-year jail term for Maryam Nawaz Sharif and the one-year sentence for Captain Safdar. “It is a historic and moral victory. The truth has prevailed”, said PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal. “It is the political struggle of Nawaz Sharif that has given him victory. We never lost the elections. In fact, we won the elections. This current government is only there because Nawaz Sharif was deliberately put behind bars. It is now proven that the whole episode of framing the Sharif family was based on a false and propagated agenda,” said PML-N senior leader Mushahid Ullah Khan. The release of Nawaz Sharif's family is being seen as a major victory for the PML-N — and may usher in more difficulties for the ruling government of Prime Minister Imran Khan. Nawaz Sharif’s family, after being released from the Adiala jail, was taken straight to the Nur Khan Airbase, from where they will be taken to their residence in Jati Umra, Lahore, on a chartered plane. The popular question Nawaz Sharif kept asking during his public rallies, after being ousted from premiership was “ ?” (Why was I ousted?). The question soon became an   with social media, along with the electronic and television media poking fun at it. The then-opposition party of Imran Khan — the PTI — also took digs at the question, calling it hilarious — after all, how could Nawaz Sharif not know why he has been sent to jail? However, the same question is back in the news again — this time, it sounds much more assertive and powerful because the Sharif family has finally been released.

182,Romita Datta,"Two major incidents, a   and a   — both within a fortnight — have once again established how casual, to the point of being apathetic, the government is to public safety. The apathy has nothing to do with ignorance; rather it is a consciously cultivated custom, coming down the ages through parties and politicians in power to protect their vote-bank in the race to survival. The cause of a fire at Bagree market, a wholesale market in central Kolkata, located within a stone’s throw away from the police headquarters, was a hawking shack in front, which stored bottles of perfumes. An eyewitness said that the perfume bottles were exploding like fire crackers and he, mistaking it to be the revelry of a Ganesh immersion ceremony, came out to see the shack in flames. Before people could be rushed to control the fire, the blaze caught the bales of cable wires stretched on the pavement and the overhanging wires, engulfing the whole building. It took 30 hours to douse the fire, but it will take even lesser time to forget the lessons learnt. A major fire which broke out at the Nandaram Market in 2008 and went on raging for 100 hours, in the last leg of the Left Front rule, brought in a set of stringent rules and regulations concerning fire safety. Nobody knows whether there was ebb in mushrooming of commercial units after that, but in a larger and wider context, there was one visible outcome for everyone to see: the Left lost these pockets and eventually its citadel in Bengal. According to a 75-year-old resident in Bagree, the market built in 1950s had a sprawling entrance. With time and obviously with the votebank pandering exercise, the Canning Street, where the market stood, was taken up by hawkers, small shops and vendors with wicker baskets. “Not any space, even as small as a toehold, in this area goes to waste. Even for a wicker basket, the seller has to pay some thousands as haafta to the local dada,” said Anisuzzaman, a local. There was only a ribbon of a space for the fire engines to move and add to that the overhanging mesh of spaghetti wiring; fire fighting was made absolutely impossible. Even the crores of money spent on hydraulic ladders for controlling fire on high-rises could not be used because the overhead wires could not be snapped. Who could be held for the aerial acquisition? When every inch of such a commercial spot reaps gold, a mutual symbiotic give-and-take exchange that benefits all for a short term, who cares for future consequences or an eventuality of a tragedy? And public memory is too short. The six-storey Bagree market has been reduced to heaps of mangled metals and ashes. A thousand shops, cubicles, call what you may, have been charred beyond recognition. Losses, so far estimated at Rs 200 crore, are mounting. The chief minister has formed an 11-member committee of ministers to take a call — more committees, more laws and steep penalty for aberration. Ministers are making daily rounds, assuring victims that they will be amply compensated. Never mind that they, the government and the various political representatives, flouted fire safety rules. And if the Majherhat bridge, built in 1950, collapsed and 21 other bridges in the city are waiting to follow suit, the government has done its bit by forewarning: take the bridges at your own risk. Some of these bridges came up during colonial times and many in the Congress and Left regime. So, the current government, in a way has washed its hands off any parental or major responsibility. And as far as repair and maintenance is concerned, the government has come up with alibis to wriggle out of any onus. If the condition of the bridges is deteriorating, it’s partly because of the unauthorised settlement and hawking zones underneath most of the flyovers. The Sealdah flyover, which is one such bridge that requires immediate attention, has an entire market under it. The market is not only a source of livelihood for lakhs of people, it is a night shelter to the population which migrates from neighbouring states and fills the political rallies and ballot boxes. West Bengal chief minister has pleaded helplessness about clearing the unauthorised occupants, even though she has spelt provision for relocation and compensation. Obviously, there’s a humanitarian side and the “Ma-Maati-Manush” government cannot falter on its basic tenets. So, if the bridges develop cracks or potholes and give a bumpy ride, the best and easiest option is to brush everything under the carpet: cement the cracks, fill up the holes with layers and layers of bitumen, notwithstanding that such overloading and cosmetic changes are actually ruining its longevity, and above everything else, awash the grime, the filth, everything that is apparently eye-sore with the city’s dress code —blue and white colours. And the PWD department tried doing so in case of Majherhat Bridge, when the finance was taking time to release fund for maintenance.

183,Rasheed Kidwai,"With the  inching closer and the countdown for 2019 Lok Sabha elections beginning, extraordinary scenes are being witnessed in Bhopal and Indore, indicating how the Congress and the BJP are trying to package inclusiveness in their electoral campaign.  Blowing of shankh (conch) by 11 priests, girls lined up for kanya puja, chanting of mantras and a whole lot of rituals at Vishwakarma temple, Lal Ghati, in Madhya Pradesh's capital city, Bhopal, had trappings of a religious ceremony. Except that on Monday afternoon, it was not.  walked in performing elaborate puja and talking with religious fervour about how a pilgrimage at Kailash-Mansarovar has transformed him. The cut-outs and hoardings of a tilakdhari Rahul Gandhi in Bhopal had a 'Shiv bhakt'.  Prime minister  , the commemoration of the martyrdom of Prophet Mohammad’s grandson Imam Husain in the battle of Karbala. Modi was seen giving a tight hug to the 53rd Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, Da'i al Mutlaq, or the supreme spiritual leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community. Next, Modi was seen reciting matami noha, marsiyah (mournful poetry) in remembrance of Imam Husain. The martyrdom of Imam Husain is a painful but significant event in the history of Islam. Husain had opposed the crowning of Yazeed ibn Mu’awiah as Islamic Caliph, refusing to accept his leadership, or endorse coercive methods. Husain and his band of loyalists, including many blood relatives of Prophet Mohammad, sacrificed their life to uphold democratic principles and values. For Rahul, a pronounced proximity to Hindu faith is important, as it may dispel the BJP's propaganda that the Congress under Gandhis, or more precisely, during the 10 years of UPA rule between 2004-2014, had only bothered — be it the UPA affidavit on the Ram Setu issue, when the Centre had told the Supreme Court that Valmiki’s account of Lord Rama lacked scientific and historical veracity, or former prime minister Manmohan Singh’s declaration that minorities had the first right on national resources. The present-day Congress think-tank has thus advised Rahul to flaunt his pro-Hindu, 'janeu dhari' credentials. In any case, the Congress' obsession with religion, particularly the flaunting of proximity to the majority community, is nothing new. In 1989, then-prime minister  had launched his Lok Sabha campaign on the banks of river Saryu in Ayodhya, promising 'Ram Rajya'. Rajiv and his home minister Buta Singh had even performed ""Shilanyas"" there. In fact, throughout the 1986-89 period, the Congress chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Veer Bahadur Singh and ND Tiwari, remained active in the competitive programme of ""occupying Ayodhya centre stage"". Time and again, these individuals came forward with the ""Rajiv formula"" and ""Tiwari plan"" and ""Shilanyas"" to pave the way for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. Somehow, each of these measures boomeranged. Rajiv lost the 1989 election, handing over power to a VP Singh-led coalition that had the support of both the BJP and the Left. Even a cursory look at state Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh would show that the entire election revolves around the performance or non-performance of incumbent chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, particularly when he has to account for 13 consecutive years of rule. Chouhan is vulnerable on many counts, such as the ever-growing crime rate, particularly in terms of crimes against women and children. Multi-crore jobs and professional examination racket —  — robbed thousands of youngsters their legitimate place in medical colleges, government jobs etc. A recently unearthed  reportedly had a criminal nexus between contractors and bureaucrats that thrived at the expense of genuine entrepreneurs and businesspersons. Madhya Pradesh has had a rather disturbing track record of corruption in the  , where three heads of health department were jailed. There is seething anger against Chouhan over recent amendments in the  . The influential upper castes, already opposed to reservation in promotion of government employees belonging to the scheduled caste and tribes, are exercised over central government's decision to changes in the SC-ST Act that rules out any provision for anticipatory bail for a person accused of atrocities against people from SC or ST communities. Agriculture is Madhya Pradesh's lifeline as three-fourth of the population is dependent on agriculture or agro-related activities, wherein farmers unrest and dissatisfaction is rather visible. But the Rahul-led Congress does not want to leave anything to chance. Rahul Gandhi is also planning to make more foreys in religious places. On September 27, he is expected to tour Satna and Rewa districts of Madhya Pradesh and pay his respects at Chitrakoot and Kamtanath temples. This region sends 48 MLAs to the 230-member state Assembly. The religious package is perhaps aimed at tackling a political situation if the Supreme Court delivers its verdict on the   dispute case that has a potential of huge political ramifications.  If Rahul is using religious identity as part of the Congress’ defence mechanism, Prime Minister Modi is not leaving anything to chance. The Prime Minister’s warmth towards Bohra community, is a broad signal to every voter across the country that inclusiveness is integral part of Modi’s vision. In this sense, Modi’s presence at Saifee mosque is not so much about courting Bohra Muslim voters but more in sync with "" "" theme. Horrible incidents of mob-lynching, cow vigilante, hate crimes may have provided ammunition to the Opposition campaign, but the Modi-led BJP plans to sell a counter narrative where government scholarships for minorities had quantum leap and Muslim percentage in government jobs went up significantly. The million-dollar question remains if voters in November 2018 and in May 2019 would buy the inclusiveness plank offered by a Shiv bhakt Rahul Gandhi or a mosque-visiting Narendra Modi.",2018-09-18,"Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections,Modi,Rahul Gandhi,Lok Sabha elections 2019",Will voters buy the inclusiveness plank offered by Shiv bhakt Rahul Gandhi and mosque-visiting Narendra Modi?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/are-voters-going-to-buy-inclusiveness-plank-offered-by-a-shiv-bhakt-rahul-gandhi-and-a-mosque-visiting-narendra-modi/story/1/26746.html
184,Ashok Upadhyay,"Poll strategist Prashant Kishor has officially taken the plunge. He has  , the ruling party in Bihar. His plunge into Bihar politics has obviously led to speculation and theories, regarding both the timing of it all and the possible reasons behind such a move. Why Nitish Kumar would want to induct him into the party is also a valid question, mostly because what would Prashant Kishor do — will he join the government? He is, after all, a political strategist, who has to his credit delivering election victories for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Thus, Kishor continuing with the same work for the party is as clear as the noonday sun. But what else can he do? There are a few theories afloat: Since the JD(U)’s return to the NDA fold in July 2017, the party has been insisting on being granted senior partner status in Bihar. This, of course, has been a problem for the BJP and the other parties in the alliance. According to  , Kishor is working on reaching a respectable split of the 40 seats available in Bihar, for the partners — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the JD(U), the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) — who are each vying for bigger shares. Kishor is also likely to use his proximity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah in resolving this contentious issue. The buzz around the block is that Prashant Kishor may contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from  . While Kishor comes from the Konar village of Rohtas district, his father later shifted to Buxar — Kishor completed his schooling there. The Buxar seat is currently represented by Union Minister Ashwini Choubey of the BJP. Like Ashwani Choubey, Kishor, too, belongs to the Brahmin community, which has a substantial population in the constituency, which makes it a safe seat for Brahmin leaders. An unnamed leader of the JD(U) has been quoted by    , ""Prashant Kishor has been inducted in the party to downsize RCP Singh who has so far been taking care of the party's functioning after Nitish Ji,"" adding that, ""Nitish Ji has got the feedback that party workers are unhappy with RCP. Many JD(U) leaders are also upset with RCP, and his differences with parliamentary affairs minister Shravan Kumar are already in the public domain."" A former IAS officer, RCP is considered the most powerful leader in the party after Nitish Kumar. Former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, and Lalu Yadav's son, Tejashwi Yadav of the RJD is giving the Bihar Chief Minister a tough time. The JD(U)’s clear lack of young, popular leaders — especially of Tejaswi's stature — might have forced Nitish Kumar to bring Kishor into the fray. Kishor is known to be on good terms not just with RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav, but with the Gandhi family as well. Should the Bihar CM plan on shifting alliances again — he has a history of doing so — a man like Kishor is likely to be part of his contingency plan to mend ties. Nitish Kumar reportedly said at the JD(U)'s state executive meeting that the state cabinet would be   after Dussehra.  It is speculated that the political strategist may be entrusted with a key portfolio in this reshuffle. Although the upper castes are largely sympathetic towards Nitish Kumar, they have never been part of his core voter base. After all, Kumar, who is an OBC, has led the JD(U) with the image of a non-Yadav OBC party. With a young and credible Brahmin face like Prashant Kishor, however, Kumar may just be attempting to break into the upper caste vote banks. Kishor’s presence in the mix is likely to help with upper caste perceptions.",2018-09-19,"Bihar,Nitish Kumar,JD(U),Prashant Kishor",7 reasons why Prashant Kishor's entry into JD(U) is good news for Nitish Kumar,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/prashant-kishor-jdu-nda-bihar-tejaswi-yadav-bjp-lalu-prasad-yadav-rjd-nitish-kumar/story/1/26754.html
185,Markandey Katju,"In a recent  with the Women's Press Corps in Delhi, Union Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, reacting to the recent JNU Students Union elections in which the Left candidates   and ABVP was routed, said that there were anti-Indian forces within the JNU campus which were waging war on India. In my opinion, the statement was puerile and inane. The real people waging war on India today are most of the Indian politicians, who polarise society and spread caste and communal hatred, instigate casteist and communal violence to get votes and amass fortunes by corruption. It is true that caste and religious differences have existed in the Indian society from before, and it is not that it is the politicians who created them. But the effort of all genuinely patriotic people should be to narrow down these differences. Instead, the effort of our politicians is to further widen and escalate them in order to get votes. India is a country with tremendous diversity, with several religions, castes, languages, ethnic and regional groups, etc. As I explained in ' ', this is because India is broadly a country of immigrants, like North America – the only difference being that in North America immigrants came mainly from Europe over the last 400 years or so, in India they have been coming in for about 10,000 years, mainly from the North West, and to a lesser extent from the North East.  About 92-93% population of India today consists of descendants of these immigrants (the   of India are the Adivasis or pre-Dravidian tribals like Bhils, Gonds, Santhals, Todas, etc., who are only 7-8% of our population). Whichever group of immigrants came to India brought with them their own language, religion, culture, customs, etc., and this explains our great diversity. As the celebrated Urdu poet Firaq Gorakhpuri said: ""In the land of Hind, the caravans of the people of the world  Kept coming in, and India kept getting formed"" In view of such tremendous diversity, it is absolutely imperative that all communities, sects and groups, whether religious, lingual, ethnic, caste or regional in India be given equal respect and treatment if we wish to keep our country united - otherwise it cannot survive long.  The real ""anti-nationals"" and the real persons waging war on India, therefore, are hardly the people inside the JNU campus. They are the ones outside – most of our politicians, who spread caste, communal, lingual, regional and ethnic hatred in our society for their selfish lust for power and pelf. India today has all that is required for becoming a first-rate industrial power, like Western countries. We have a huge pool of technical talent (many of our engineers are manning Silicon Valley in California, and many Indians are Professors in Science, Engineering and Mathematics Departments in Western Universities) and we have immense natural resources.  By now, we should have become another super-power, like China, with our people enjoying a high standard of living. But instead we are still having colossal poverty, unemployment, farmers' distress, malnourishment, etc., and we are still embroiled in Ram Mandir, cow protection and caste politics, which is entirely due to our crooked politicians, not JNU students.  So, who are the real ""anti-nationals"", and who is waging war on India?

186,Saif Ullah Khan,"Poll strategist Prashant Kishor has started a new innings. After handling the election campaigns for different political parties over the last six years, Kishor joined JD(U) on September 16 in the presence of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar during the state executive meet of the party. 
 
 Earlier, Kishor announced his   from election campaigning for political parties. ""[For] two years, I have been wanting to get out of this domain. It could have been post-the Uttar Pradesh poll results, but the failure put the decision on hold. In 2019, you will not see PK campaigning for any party or individual,"" he had said during the ISB Hyderabad Leadership Summit. Kishor started by working on Narendra Modi's campaign for his fourth stint as Gujarat's Chief Minister in 2012, moving on to manage Modi's Prime Ministerial campaign for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections – and steered the BJP to a resounding victory. He was the brains behind campaigns like Modi's 'Chai Pe Charcha', Manthan and the party's social media interventions. Known for using surveys, constituency-wise analysis to devise his electoral strategies, Kishor became Modi's chief poll strategist. In 2015, Kishor parted ways with the BJP and joined hands with Nitish Kumar to manage the JD(U)'s election campaign for the 2015 Bihar Assembly polls. He came up with 'Parcha Pe Charcha', modeled on his earlier campaign of 'Chai Pe Charcha', to get feedback from voters on the government's performance and the campaign slogan of ""Bihar Mein Bahar Ho, Nitish Kumar Ho"". To better connect party workers with the voters, he also devised the   campaign. Kishor was instrumental in bridging the differences between Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav and ensured that Modi, who had recently swept the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, did not breach the Bihar fortress. The campaign worked and the JD(U), RJD and Congress Mahagathbandhan won the 2015 Bihar polls, further cementing Kishor's credentials as a master strategist. In 2016, Kishor shifted camp once again and moved on to manage the Congress' campaign for the 2016 Punjab Assembly elections. Captain Amarinder Singh won the elections and Kishor stayed on to manage the party's campaign for the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. The drubbing the Congress-SP combine got at the hands of the BJP in the 2017 UP Assembly polls dented the poll strategist's invincible image and he laid low, later going on to manage the campaign of YSR Congress' Jagan Mohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh. Kishor himself acknowledged that he shares a cordial relationship with both Prime Minister Modi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi and has been in touch with both the national parties. The reason why the seasoned strategist chose to go with a regional party was the elbow room it provides him to operate. Both the BJP and the Congress, despite having a national footprint, are huge organisations – and Kishor would find himself fighting for space with other well-established players. JD(U), on the other hand, is a one-man show, where Nitish holds sway; proximity to him would ensure Kishor is able to carry out and better implement his strategies for the party. Having helped Nitish at one of the lowest points in his political career, Kishor ensured JD(U)'s win in the 2015 Assembly polls after the party's dismal performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the master strategist knows he can get a significant position within the party's organisational structure. A resident of Buxar in Bihar, there are already talks of him contesting the next Lok Sabha elections from the constituency or being rewarded with the currently contested Rajya Sabha seat of Sharad Yadav. While party workers seem pleased with the strategist joining the party, there is a sense of unease among senior functionaries, especially given Nitish Kumar's comments that 'he is the future of the party'. Having already proved his bones during the earlier Assembly elections in 2015, Kishor brings much-needed energy to the party. Already under   from RJD's Tejashvi Yadav on the Muzaffarpur shelter home case, the party desperately needs a better and more proactive response to the charges, something that the strategist is an expert at. His social media and marketing strategies could significantly blunt the opposition's charges on the deteriorating law and order in the state and ensure 'Sushasan babu' is back in the reckoning. He would also be playing a major role in JD(U)'s seat-sharing talks with the BJP. Having recently met Amit Shah, Kishor is likely to get a good deal for his party for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. Having officially joined the JD(U), Kishore would also be working for the NDA for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls – something that could prove to be a challenge for the united Opposition that is depending heavily on their own social media campaigns to take on Modi. Kishor, known for his social media interventions and marketing campaigns that connect directly with the voters, would also have to step in for other NDA partners.  Faced with a united Opposition, the Narendra Modi-led NDA would be more than pleased to use the services of a seasoned campaign manager.  With the electoral space having undergone a sea change from the 2014 campaign he undertook for Modi, Kishor also has his work cut out for him. While earlier Modi was riding high on Congress' anti-incumbency and major corruption charges against it, this time, the NDA is facing the heat. Having finally thrown his hat into the political ring, the poll strategist will have to ensure a win for his party. With no political base of his own, to survive in the political arena, Kishor will have to up his strategist game.",2018-09-17,"2019 Lok Sabha polls,JD(U),Nitish Kumar,Prashant Kishor",Will Prashant Kishor joining JD(U) deliver 2019 Lok Sabha Polls to the NDA?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/nitish-kumar-narendra-modi-prashant-kishor-jd-u-nda-2019-lok-sabha-elections/story/1/26716.html
187,Brig SK Chatterji (retd),"India's attempts at equipment acquisition for modernisation of the armed forces have faced charges of graft since the days of the  . During the tenure of the previous ministry, the then   had cancelled one contract after another and was yet unable to get to the bottom of any one of it and book the culprits. One of his favourite methods was   of companies. At one stage almost every reputed manufacturer of guns, globally, had been booked leaving no leeway for the army to induct guns for 30 years. A similar fate had been the narrative for the Air Force. The   has its moorings dating back to 2007. The bids received then were opened in 2011. When the Rafale deal was finally signed between India and France in 2016, the armed forces and the strategic community had heaved a sigh of relief. The Indian Air Force is down to 31 squadrons against an authorisation of 42. However, the no-holds barred methodologies of Indian politics have its tendrils around the contract, strangulating it hard enough to perhaps stall the expected deliveries in 2019. The first fact that needs to be assimilated is the fact that  was not a normal commercial deal entered with its manufacturer  . It was an inter government arrangement between the French and the Indian governments. Somewhat similar deals have also been executed under the  of the Americans; a case in point being the 155mm M777 Howitzers of BAE Systems. With the levels of interaction being finally at the levels of two sovereign governments, such deals are considered as the safest methodology possible to avoid grafts in military equipment procurement. The basic allegations being hurled are focused on the price that we are paying for each of the aircraft bare bone, that is, without its complement of weapons, India specific requirements and additional costs for the maintenance and repair that the French will undertake as part of the deal. As per the press statements of Union minister  , the Rafale deal for 126 aircrafts in 2007 was at a cost of euro 79.3 million per aircraft. A built in escalation factor was part of the deal. Applying the escalation factor, the cost in 2011 when the bids were opened, amounted to euro 100.85 million per aircraft. The price at which the Rafales were finally contracted is euro 91.75 million per aircraft. It amounts to an approximate savings of 9 per cent. The India specific requirements that includes helmet-mounted display, electronic jammers, operating from airfields at high altitudes; a total of 13 requirements amounts Rs 9855 crore. This expenditure is, however, non-recurring and would have remained a constant had we gone in for 126 aircrafts also. Thus, the overall costs per unit would have reduced had India opted for more numbers. We have also gone in for Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles and SCALP air-to-ground missiles, which are the best in the class. These missiles were not a part of the old contract. A maintenance contract is also inbuilt in the contract and includes supply of spares and a commitment to maintain serviceability rates at 75 per cent for the next five years.  It would be prudent to recall that the serviceability state of our Sukhois has been a cause for consternation in the past. Higher serviceability state provides a higher capability to the squadrons in their ability to average more sorties per aircraft, per day. There is also a 50 per cent offset clause that exceeds the norm of 30 per cent for such contracts. Offsets involve expending a laid down percentage of the contract for various stipulated activities in the Indian market. As part of offsets, Dassault has made arrangements with 72 entities for manufacture of various parts that it would source in India. One of these entities is Reliance. As of now there is no evidence to point a finger at the joint venture between Dassault and Reliance Group. However, our handling of offsets in the past has been below par with billions of dollars worth offsets not executed in time. As and when it’s time for Dassault to start claiming offset credits by actual discharge of offsets, the process will require due diligence. We have the example of offset discharge in the M777 Ultra Light Howitzer deal to go by, and it should be possible to ensure that offset discharge does not get messy. With a huge 50 per cent offset liability, the process of discharge of offsets will also call for close scrutiny. The   will be the responsibility of Dassault for five years. Provisions for the same have been made in the contract. The contract calls for 75 per cent serviceability, which is as good as can be expected in such contracts. The allegations against the deal have been inconsistent. The prices of the aircraft quoted in the allegations have fluctuated hugely. In fact, a state was reached when the Air Force Chief and Vice Chief both came on record regarding the allegations. The Indian Air Force conducted a seminar to defend the deal. It was a welcome step in a country where politicians don’t realise that senior officers in uniform come into disrepute because of unsubstantiated statements. As far as the disclosure of the price breakdown is concerned the inter-governmental arrangement lays down certain protocols. As per the statement of the Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the agreement was entered into during the regime of the previous government. Such restrictions have been applicable in other defence contracts during the regimes of other ministries too. Notwithstanding the Rafale deal as such, the tendency of our current day political leadership to take every issue that could garner public attention to the streets has repeatedly proven detrimental for our defence preparedness. The   is an issue beyond debate. The fact also remains that the two squadrons of Rafales address a critical capability gap that Indians have. In fact, only two squadrons are hardly adequate to redress the dearth in numbers of fighter aircrafts. Should we want the Air Force to be a deterrent factor, early conclusion of the  , recently approved by the government, should be our next focus. Hopefully, the current government will not baulk in the face of all the din that is part and parcel of the Indian tradition nowadays.",2018-09-18,"Nirmala Sitharaman,Ak antony,Defence Ministry,Rafale Deal",Will Rafale deal be able to dodge the political fusillade?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rafale-deal-defence-ministry-ak-antony-nirmala-sitharaman-ravi-shankar-prasad-france/story/1/26728.html
188,Sharat Pradhan,"The  Dalit activist and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad from jail, and the Yogi Adityanath government’s decision to withdraw the National Security Act (NSA) slapped on him and his two associates, is clearly aimed at wooing Dalits. The politics behind the move is understandable. After all, it was not without reaping a harvest of Dalit votes that the BJP swept the Lok Sabha polls in 2014, bagging 71 of UP’s 80 seats. This was largely due to the success of then-PM candidate Narendra Modi in projecting himself as a leader who could fulfill the aspirations of every deprived and underprivileged Indian.  Four-and-a-half years down the line, the same aspiring youth seem increasingly disenchanted with the PM and the BJP, giving them much to worry about.   The BJP’s resounding success in 2014 was built upon its ability to dig into the vote banks of parties like the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP).  The election results had in particular stunned Mayawati, who saw slipping out of her grasp what her mentor Kanshi Ram had taken years to build. Not in her worst nightmares would she have imagined that the party she had always accused of being the “oppressor” of Dalits would so severely dent the vote-bank she had considered her domain since the late eighties.  The weakening of Mayawati’s hold over what was once her exclusive vote-bank paved the way for the rise of other Dalit outfits. Bhim Army was once such organisation that came up largely on account of the prevailing political vacuum. However, the outfit’s rise to prominence coincided with Mayawati beginning to reconsolidate her vote bank.  Initially, she took the Bhim Army quite lightly, and was perhaps convinced that sooner or later, Chandrashekhar Azad would come under her wings. Also known by his self-assumed title ‘Ravan’ — which he has now dropped — Chandrashekhar first came into prominence for  local Rajputs in Saharanpur in March 2016.The Rajputs had objected to the prefix “Great” before “Ch****s” on a welcome signboard outside a village. However, Mayawati chose to ignore the incident. A year later, in May 2017, Chandrashekhar Azad again hit the headlines after the Bhim Army clashed with Rajputs over Maharana Pratap Jayanti celebrations. A Dalit activist was killed, and while the police described the death as “accidental”, the Bhim Army insisted it was murder. This time, Mayawati went to the extent of terming the  The reason was simple — Behenji could not digest the thought of any other organisation championing the cause of Dalits. Yet, in order to remain politically right, she also issued a statement hitting out at the Yogi Adityanath government, for the rising crimes in the state.  Once again now, she has reacted quite sharply to Chandrashekhar’s remarks since he was released from prison. Chandrashekhar, after coming out of jail, had said  with the BSP, and that he and “bua” (paternal aunt) Mayawati were of the same blood. However, Mayawati was  a sharp retort. “I do not think there is any need for another organisation to look after the interests and well-being of Dalits”, she said. Without taking Chandrashekhar’s name, she added: “Some persons are unnecessarily trying to project themselves as some kind of messiah of Dalits. If someone is describing me as his “bua”, it means nothing. Such persons are perhaps only trying to conceal their age by referring to me as their aunt.”  Sources claim that Mayawati is averse to Chandrashekhar, whom she sees as a threat to her own vote bank, even though Chandrashekhar has repeatedly emphasised that he does not wish to contest the 2019 elections. He insists, “Our objective is to create social awareness among Dalits and to fight for their rights.”  Meanwhile, stories are already   about the Bhim Army’s increasing proximity to the Congress. It may also be pertinent to mention that Rahul Gandhi has praised Chandrashekhar and his organisation. This could be one of the reasons for Mayawati’s obvious antipathy towards the new Dalit leader. If insiders are to be believed, Mayawati would warm up to the Bhim Army only if Chandrashekhar merges it with the BSP, instead of running it as an independent entity.  Mayawati has been recalcitrant not just with the Bhim Army, but with the larger “grand alliance” too, and has repeatedly said  the coalition unless offered a respectable number of seats. The BSP leader knows well that without her, the Mahagathbandhan will not be in a position to take on the BJP and the charisma of PM Modi. However, this election will also definitively decide her political relevance. Mayawati knows she is walking a tightrope, and is thus weighing each step carefully.",2018-09-17,"Uttar Pradesh,Dalit votes,Chandrashekhar Azad,Mayawati",‘Bua’ Mayawati snubs Chandrashekhar: A new battle for Dalit votes in Uttar Pradesh,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mayawati-chandrashekhar-azad-bhim-army-bsp-uttar-pradesh-dalit-votes-bjp/story/1/26718.html
189,Markandey Katju,"I read Pratap Bhanu Mehta's  published in   on September 11 titled: On Liberty, Tomorrow's India needs a new Charter of Freedom. Does Congress have the courage to sign on to it?. Mr Mehta argues that Congress needs to declare a new Charter of Freedom, abolishing, or at least providing safeguards against misuse of, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, preventive detention laws, sedition law, etc. With due respect to him, I would like to say two things in response: 1. When most Indians vote in elections all they see is the caste or religion of the candidate or party representing a caste or religion. They are not bothered about whether the candidate or party supports freedom and civil liberties, nor are they bothered about the merit of the candidate or his party. That is why we have caste and communal vote banks in India, and why so many persons with criminal backgrounds get elected to the legislatures. In the Lok Sabha elections held after the  imposed in 1975 (in which civil liberties and freedoms were suppressed) the Congress was almost wiped out in North India but it did well in the South. This was because nasbandi (compulsory sterilisation) was sought to be effectively implemented in the North but not in the South. This shows that the results had nothing to do with freedom or its suppression during the Emergency, because civil liberties were suppressed in the South too. So Mr Mehta's counsel to the Congress to proclaim a Charter of Freedoms only reveals that ""intellectuals"" like him are out of touch with realities. In India, most people don't cast their vote, they vote their caste. A Charter of Freedom will fetch no votes. 2. Most people want food in their bellies and jobs. They are hardly bothered about freedom of speech, liberty etc. In Germany Hitler was very popular (except among Jews) for a long time after coming to power in 1933 because, though he suppressed freedom, he almost wiped out unemployment, which had become massive under the earlier Weimar Republic. Mr Mehta refers to the recent   (in connection with the Bhima Koregaon incident) under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and says ""If the party showed courage and categorically comes out in favour of a new Charter of Freedoms it would show a courage of conviction. It would speak to the young people powerfully "". I regret to say that however noble his intentions may be, Mr Mehta and ""intellectuals"" like him, are totally divorced from the realities of Indian politics which runs on the basis of caste and religion, not on the support given to freedom. Even most Indian youth, referred to in the above statement, are as casteist and communal as their elders. After all, the lynchers of Ikhlaque, Pehlu Khan and Rakbar Khan were not elderly people. Even the students who voted   to the 4 posts in the Delhi University Students Union in the recent elections were also youth, not the elderly.",2018-09-15,"BJP,Congress,Emergency,Bhima Koregaon",Why India doesn't need a Charter of Freedoms,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/charter-of-freedoms-caste-religion-bhima-koregaon-emergency-congress-bjp/story/1/26670.html
190,Shuja-ul-Haq,"There is a shadow of doubt looming large over the upcoming elections for municipal bodies and panchayats in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Poll  calls are nothing new in the valley. For around two decades we have been seeing the separatist parties asking the people to stay away from the polls. Their main argument has been the polls bear no meaning unless there was a final resolution to larger Kashmir problem. Mainstream parties or pro-India parties as they are commonly termed in the valley have been the ones who have been taking the baton of elections under the constitution of India forward. However this time things are different. The mainstream political parties have said no to elections. First, it was the National Conference, which announced that the party won't participate and then the other largest party PDP also followed suit. Other smaller parties and leaders have shown lack of interest in the elections. They have based their boycott on the   and the special status of the state. Article 35A of the Indian Constitution is an article that empowers the Jammu and Kashmir State's legislature to define “permanent residents” of the state and provide special rights to them. Article 35A was brought through a Presidential order in 1954. This issue has taken the centre stage in Kashmir ever since a petition was filed by an NGO with links to right-wing parties of the country. This petition seeks removal of this Article by challenging the procedure through which it was inserted into the constitution of India. It is not the first time that such petitions challenging the special status of the state have been filed and dismissed by the courts. But what is different in this case is that the central government seems to be shifting its stance on the issue. In one of the earlier hearings of this petition, the centre had told the court that the issue can be debated – a stand which it had never taken before. In the recent hearing, the government has said in the Supreme Court to defer the matter as the state was preparing for the local bodies polls. The political parties in the state feel that it was wrong on behalf of the government to use polls as a reason. They believe that the government should have rather come out clearly on the issue to dispel the doubts over its intentions that have cropped up in the minds of the people. NC and PDP have said that in such a situation there is no meaning of participating in these polls. The separatists, who have been boycotting the polls for many years have a sense of vindication. For several years militant groups have also been calling for election boycotts. But the elections used to happen and many of them would see huge participation of the people. The credit of these electoral successes would directly be given to the mainstream political parties who would campaign and bring people to the polling booth on various promises of development and resolution. The government of India would eventually present the participation as an indicator that things were heading for normalcy and there was a support to the policies of the state by the people in this conflict zone. However over past few years, largely due to the handling of Kashmir by the central government, the people of the valley have been left feeling dejected and they have shown this in their lack of interest in the electoral process. In 2017 the parliament by-polls for Srinagar saw humiliating voter turn out of just 7 per cent. The polls for the Anantnag seat had to be cancelled and haven’t taken place until now. This happened when the mainstream parties were very much in the fray one can only assume what would be the fate of the municipal and panchayat polls when these parties have openly excused themselves out. Many experts believe that the way things are going there is a serious risk that the outcome could be seen as a referendum against the Indian state. That is the reason there is a view that rather than being adamant on holding the polls in the current atmosphere it would have been better for the government to start the process of talks to send out a message to the people that it was serious on finding a permanent solution to this decades-long conflict.",2018-09-15,"Narendra Modi,BJP,PDP,NC",Why the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir municipal and panchayat polls need to be called off,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-article-35a-panchayat-municipal-nc-pdp-bjp-narendra-modi/story/1/26676.html
191,Asit Jolly,"A 19-year-old, who could have been a fitting ambassador for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, is right now petrified about venturing from the four walls of her home. This extraordinarily bright young girl, who is pursuing a bachelor’s program in science,   of the extreme misogyny that, depressingly, continues to prevail across the Haryanvi hinterland.  She was waylaid, abducted and gang-raped while on her way to a coaching class in Kanina Khas, a little township in Haryana’s Mahendergarh district. Her assailants, like in several similar instances in the state, were young men she recognised and knew as neighborhood boys. Trusting them enough to accept a sip of water from them, she found herself losing consciousness, only to awaken at a spot far enough from the township for her cries of distress to go unheard. Describing her ordeal, the girl has told the police they took turns raping her, after forcing her to drink some more of the intoxicant-laced water so she couldn’t resist their assault. They later dropped her off, battered and barely conscious, at a local bus stop.  The police have identified her alleged assailants as an army jawan on leave, a local wrestler, and a local college student. Distressingly, there’s a good chance the men did what they did to give the girl this chilling message: no matter how hard she studied and how much she excelled, she would never be safe in Haryana.  Consider this: in the past four years, under the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government, the state has seen  , including rape, abduction and molestation. That, incredulously, is more than 26 cognisable crimes against Haryanvi women every single day!  And this situation prevails not just in the relatively less patrolled rural hinterland. Gurugram, which is touted as the ‘Millenium City’, and Faridabad, have the highest reported incidence of such crimes, with 3,768 and 3,440 reported cases of sexual assault.  Haryana Police officers at Kanina told visiting reporters that the victim had known the army man for some months, evidently alluding to more than a nodding relationship. Are they actually trying to suggest that the crime was any less horrific because she knew one of her assailants?  Mainly because of her academic achievements, the girl’s plight has caught the media’s attention in a manner that Khattar and his government cannot wish away.  Haryana’s Women’s Commission has stepped in, and has said it will closely monitor police investigations into the case. The victim has temporarily been given protection within a government hospital, where doctors are supervising her recovery.  Chief minister Khattar has said that the “ and whoever is found guilty will be punished.” He needs to do more than that. He must ensure that the young victim is protected and gets the counseling she needs to get past her trauma.  He needs to understand that the assault on the 19-year-old in Kanina is an assault on everything Haryana’s women — from Kalpana Chawla to Manushi Chhillar, Santosh Yadav to the Phogat sisters and Sakshi Malik — have so brilliantly achieved in the recent years. It is also threatens to completely undermine the state’s recent successes in improving sex ratios and learning levels in schools.",2018-09-15,"Sexual assault,Crimes against Women,Manohar Lal Khattar,Haryana gang rape",19-year-old’s gang rape is an assault on everything Haryana’s women have achieved: CM Khattar must ensure justice to her,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/haryana-gang-rape-19-year-old-rapes-manohar-lal-khattar-crimes-against-women/story/1/26679.html
192,Soumyadipta Banerjee,"On July 26, 2018, US President Donald Trump declared war on Twitter from his Twitter account. He accused Twitter of shadow banning prominent Republican handles and threatened to launch an investigation. Here is his angry tweet below. Twitter had already responded by then. Their co-founder Jack Dorsey tweeted and clarified that shadow banning is a myth and it doesn't happen in their company.  His PR department was activated, he and his hand-picked team went on a press merry-go-round, trying to explain the situation. His senior employees wrote blogs and gave interviews, trying to prove their own country's President wrong. Unfortunately, in the process, they revealed more than what they could conceal. They not only exposed a faulty methodology, very soon, everybody's worst fears took shape. Twitter admitted that it has been  , monitoring them actively through artificial intelligence, ranking them, restricting them and also making them 'disappear' at times. The way and the logic behind the profiling was never revealed. We will come back to all that later, but first, let's address the immediate question in your mind. ""Come on, that's the US. How do you know it's happening in India?""  The fact is that like any US-based MNC, the chunk of the company's policies are decided at their headquarters. So, most of the policies that were formulated in the US headquarters were applied all over the world including India. I am prepared to take a bet with you. Let's bet a hundred rupees with each of you. I know that tens of thousands read my pieces, so its not a mean sum that I am willing to pay.  I am so confident of the odds because I know in my heart that it is true that Twitter handles belonging to the right wing political ideology are treated no better than the Republicans in the US. Many prominent Twitter handles belonging to the right wing feel that many of their followers (the figure might be in lakhs for each one of them) don't get to see their tweets in their timeline. The complaint is the same and many among them have tweeted about it too.  Time and again, you will see some prominent right wingers in India wonder why their tweets are not visible to their followers or the followers wonder why they don't see some prominent right wing tweets on their timelines, even though they are tweeting regularly. They have to go to their profiles to see their tweets. This is not the only question that has baffled Twitter users. There are others too. Here are some other sample questions from right wingers and their supporters. Maybe you might identify with some of them. 1) Why does Twitter immediately lock down some people as 'punishment' — and why does it allow some people to post freely, even if they are using the same kind of language and content? 2) Why some prominent users never get too many retweets or impressions or why are these (interactions on tweets) decreasing over a period of time? 3) Why do some users increasingly feel isolated while others feel that they are thriving on Twitter? Is there discrimination? 4) Is it true that users are profiled according to their political views or, specifically, right wingers are given the wrong end of the stick on Twitter? 5) Does Twitter profile its users? If yes, what do they do next?  In today's blog, I wanted to clarify all these rumours based on the content that has surfaced on the internet from Twitter employees themselves.  Chances are you may have missed spotting these despite the declarations coming from Twitter employees themselves.  So, here's the truth along with proof.  Read on. Truth number 1: Twitter Employees are left-leaning in their ideology and have a strong bias towards the left political narrative.  This admission has come from no less than the CEO and co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey.   In an interview with CNN, Jack admitted that their employees are biased towards left ideology. The mention is made in the passing, but he says it in a very straightforward manner.  So, Twitter management — and the team that controls you as users — are effectively subscribing to left ideology.  Here's the video of Jack's admission to CNN. 
 
 All over the world, across political landscapes, the left and the right are at loggerheads. Most propaganda from the left targets the right wing.  So, there goes the neutrality of the platform. Truth Number 2: There are some evolving policies about profiling Twitter users that are never discussed in public. This admission too comes from Twitter employees.  On January 11 this year,   published an   about Twitter that showed their senior employees admitting that they restrict users based on their tweets — they admitted that political ideology is one of the major factors of the profiling. One of the employees also  that left-leaning conversations sometimes go on unchecked because they are profiled as ""good boys"".  The employees were also seen  in the undercover video that they use Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to profile users based on their tweets and replies. Employees admitted that political ideology is an important factor of the profiling and shockingly, left is right for Twitter. The more aggressive (or abusive) an user is, the more a person is ranked lower. Also, they work towards an inform user experience, which basically means to give more prominence to users that   feel deserve it. The question is: If you are left-leaning, which user would you prefer? They also admitted that some users are thrown off the search grid just because the platform may look clean.  The video was published on Youtube but it didn't get the kind of attention it deserved. Here's the video below. Interesting to note that the admissions are coming from code-writers who actually do it and not some senior management folk.  Take a look and prepare to get shocked. Twitter hasn't denied that the employees who are featured are their own.   Truth number three: Twitter also admits that they rank Twitter users based on their ""behaviour"" Yes, they are playing Big Boss with you and apparently punishing you for being naughty or having a divergent view. Yes, Twitter has itself admitted that behaviour is the key element on which Twitter decides how you should be treated on the platform.   But have they clarified exactly which behaviour will make you look like a ""bad-faith actor"" (Twitter's own term) and what makes you look like a influencer? Yes, a little. It has said that if you interact with known abusive handles, if you get blocked by some prominent people, if you reply aggressively (or abusively) to other 'good' handles and if you get reported by good-faith users, then your ""Quality Score"" will get affected and you will be treated as somebody who needs to be restricted.  Did somebody just remind you of school?  Sounds unbelievable? Well, the Twitter management has admitted that in writing.  Read this   posted by Twitter's Vice President (Trust and Safety), Del Harvey and David Gasca, Director of Product Management and Health. This blog was subsequently   by the Product Head of Twitter, Kayvon Beykpour.  Now for the left-leaning organisation, is this possible that left-leaners may get a free run on the platform and right wingers are dubbed as people with ""bad faith""? Your guess is as good as mine.  Truth number four: If you are ranked below, your tweets are ranked far, far below.  We don't need to cite an example here. There are too many.   We just need to understand how the ranking system works to understand why your tweets vanish from certain timelines.  For any mobile user (more than 90 per cent tweets in India are checked on the mobile platform), the first three to five scrolls are very important because that is what arrests your attention. Twitter supports unending scroll but none of the users will scroll like that. You basically scroll three to five times on an average before Twitter refreshes your feed again.  So, what happens when your tweet is ranked adversely or below?  That's right, people who have tweeted during the same time period (or even later) will find their tweets ranked below others, sometimes put much below than five scrolls. So, even before you can reach that tweet, Twitter refreshes your feed with fresh tweets. This creates an illusion that your tweets have vanished from the feed of your followers but in reality, it has been ranked much below, so below that it takes an active effort to fight against auto feed refreshes to reach to your tweet. Truth number five: Twitter listens to signals which includes ""good"" handles screaming that you are bad. In algorithm, they call it 'signals'. Signals are typically a tune in a sea of white noise, easy to detect and locate. Twitter uses various signals to rank users (you may go back to the video again) or look at this  from Twitter safety. The 'signals' about some users are too many in India to ignore and they have not gone unheard.  Have you seen one of these lists floating around about the abusive handles on Twitter? And the ones that list only prominent right wing users as abusive? I bet you've seen some of them, right? That may be considered as one of the signals by Twitter''s own admission. If you want to do your sample study or verify it yourself, I suggest you go to each one of the right wing users and ask if they feel if they are getting shadow blocked on the platform or the impressions that they get on their tweets are just lessening by the day.  There, you have your answer.  May I have my money now?  ",2018-09-13,"Vivek Agnihotri,Right-wing,White House,Donald Trump",Why Right may be wrong on Twitter,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/donald-trump-white-house-right-wing-vivek-agnihotri-swara-bhaskar/story/1/26630.html
193,Atul K Thakur,"The recently held   (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) conference made Kathmandu a safe haven for optimists and escapists alike who found refuge in living the conference-mode for a short while. In sheer euphoria, albeit briefly, it was forgotten that geopolitics was the raison d’être for the birth of BIMSTEC. And this is because the Indian Ocean is strategically important — where rivalry between China and India is real and not easy enough to be overlooked. Noticeably, China heavily relies on the Indian Ocean and the Malacca Strait for oil movement, where the US Navy has considerable influence. China, thus essentially, is desperate to open alternate access points in BIMSTEC member-countries. This goes with China’s expansionist tendency to disturb the bilateral and trilateral spheres in South Asia, where India has conventionally been a strong player. There is a perception that puts forward a case where the  . Hence, there is an official Chinese line that views India’s control over the Indian Ocean as a threat to China’s energy security with or without the US. Moreover, India’s ‘Look East’ is taken as a policy to counter China’s ‘String of Pearls’ strategy. With BIMSTEC, India hopes to get China to step back from the Indian Ocean. India’s unprecedented recent investment in its naval force is a step in the direction of creating and maintaining a level-playing field with an aggressive and unpredictable China. To give an impression of BIMSTEC unity through the joint military exercise that was not originally a part of the BIMSTEC charter, India ended up temporarily shaking the political establishment in Nepal. Surprisingly, resistance came not only from within the ruling Communist block, but also the main Opposition. The Nepali Congress vehemently resisted Nepal’s move to join the  . Under fire from all sides, Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli did what he was expected to do. Nepal decided against participating in the military exercise. However, to pacify the host, it let the officers, who had already reached Pune, stay there as observers. Nepal, otherwise not known for flexing its muscle or having an ambition to emerge as a strong military power, came down heavily on the plan that had the potential to irk China. Significantly, the  was signed during this tumultuous phase — a deal that ended Nepal’s dependence on India for vital access to ports. The double-jolt to India was not something that was expected from Nepal in the wake of the BIMSTEC summit, giving enough reasons to the   to rethink its event-centric methods in dealing with external affairs. What is required is to let policies guide action in the region and come to terms with changing fundamentals in the immediate neighbourhood. From the Indian perspective, Delhi needs to accept that Nepal has been working keeping in view mass sentiments that wanted the country to end its over-dependence on India, without disturbing the natural tenets of friendly ties. While India will keep availing the goodwill generated over the decades in Nepal, it is unlikely that it will enjoy the same dominating position ever again.  According to the new agreement, China has also agreed to allow Nepal to use its land ports at Lanzhou, Lhasa and Shigatse and roads linking to these places. Under this arrangement, it would be possible now to route Nepal-bound cargo from Japan, South Korea and other north Asian countries through China, saving shipping time and costs. As of now, Nepal heavily relies on India for overland trade and for the supply of essential goods, including fuel and cooking gas. has been the lifeline so far, but with changing equations, it may now face stiff competition with ties between Kathmandu and Beijing deepening. Noticeably, China managed to route over $8 billion into investments in Nepal last year, leaving India way behind as the country’s largest foreign investor. A series of misguided interventions from New Delhi in recent years, especially the alarming  as a mark of denouncement against Nepal’s new Constitution, created a deep chasm between the two countries. The damage-control measures by New Delhi were seen as too little, too late. Meanwhile, China, that was desperate to get greater hold over Nepal, seized the moment and exploited it in its favour. Apparently, the Modi government’s pet foreign policy, ‘Neighbourhood First’, is not serving India’s cause on expected lines in Nepal, and is instead letting China pursue its nasty expansionist policies.    What came as an aftershock was that Nepal has reportedly decided to take part in a  . Nepal Army spokesperson Brig Gen Gokul Bhandari shared with the media that the joint exercise between Nepal and China is called “ ” and will take place on September 17-28 in Chengdu. The main focus of the exercise would be counter-terror operations. If all goes as planned, this should worry India. But to stay on turf, New Delhi will have to give counter-strategy a chance. Overlooking due procedures and undermining the role of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) will further damage India’s chances in the tug of war with China — where Nepal is an underrated trump card. Clearly, the recent developments show how Oli is getting success in consolidating support from ""reactionary forces"" in his favour — and challenging his political rivals (though within the coalition), including Prachanda, who was in India when these major decisions were taken. As Prachanda’s claim on the Prime Minister's chair is due, Oli played a master stroke to diminish his balanced stand for India and China.

194,Balbir Punj,"What to make of several statements Rahul Gandhi, scion of Nehru/Gandhi clan, made during his recent trip to the UK and  ? In one such gathering held at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London (Aug 25, 2018), Rahul said, “RSS is trying to change the nature of India. There is no other organisation in India that wants to capture India’s institutions. RSS’ idea is similar to the idea of Muslim Brotherhood in Arab world.” Speaking at Bucerius Summer School in Hamburg (Aug 22 , 2018), he again likened  . He alleged minorities are excluded from the development process and are getting alienated. This has created a space for insurgency in the country. He also said, “When the US attacked Iraq in 2003, they introduced a law that did not allow one particular tribe from getting public jobs. It didn’t stop there and connected with the global Internet to form the horrific idea — ISIS.” How do the bizarre theories floated by Rahul on foreign soil measure against facts? It was the Congress-led UPA government that had in 2013 hosted Mohammed Morsi, then Egyptian president and a key leader of the Brotherhood. Seven agreements were signed on the occasion. Later, Morsi was overthrown and his defence minister Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, became president. Morsi is now in jail “The RSS is trying to change the nature of India,” the Congress chief had said in London. “It is similar to the idea that exists in the Arab world of the Muslim Brotherhood. The idea is that one ideology should run through every institution and one idea should crush all other ideas.” Is it not that all well-meaning Indians want India to change and change for the better? An India sans corruption, crime, crony capitalism and nepotism. RSS may be obsessed with its ideology (nothing wrong in that) but is it not a fact that Congress during over five decades of its rule in independent India has refused to see beyond Nehru / Gandhi clan? Every second institution built and run by public funds is named after one family. Comparing Muslim Brotherhood with RSS and BJP is ridiculous. While the Muslim Brotherhood is a declared terrorist organisation, RSS has a history of over 90 years of service to the country. Its volunteers have always been engaged in relief work during natural calamities. RSS’ declared creed is Hindutva. The organisation represents India’s timeless inclusive ethos and Catholic outlook. RSS is against bigotry and is progressive in its attitude and believes in social justice. In spite of the Left-inspired venomous campaign spanning over more than half a century, RSS is a force to reckon with in India and abroad. Rahul is right when he says a large number of Indian Muslims are alienated from the mainstream of the country. But this is true of several Christian majority countries of Europe and the US as well. Even in Islamic countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan, large sections of Muslims are at war with the followers of other religions and also among themselves. The Muslim-dominated Kashmir valley has been at war with the rest of the country for long, irrespective of the party in power at the Centre. More Muslims are killed in Pakistan and Afghanistan by fellow Muslims than by non-Muslims in the entire world. What has all this to do with either BJP or RSS? According to Rahul, ISIS came into being in 2004 because a particular group was denied jobs. It is over-simplification of a complex phenomenon. Nowhere in the world jobless go around beheading others and getting killed themselves in the process. These jihadis, as per their own claims, are motivated to kill and get killed, by Islamic theology. Many Muslim-converts from Christianity in Europe have become terrorists. Then, what has it to do with development? Can there be anybody else more accommodative than the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi? He bent backwards to accommodate Muslims in united India, but he failed to stop the Partition. Do we take Rahul seriously? Not necessarily.

195,Arun Anand,"The all-India bandh call, or  , organised by the Opposition to protest a hike in fuel prices and a fall in the value of the rupee, has evoked mixed reactions. While the Opposition is claiming this event to have been a huge success, independent observers have serious reservations about these lofty claims as the Bharat Bandh fizzled out in most states — except at certain places where Congress workers reportedly unleashed violence. While the politics of protest would continue, especially in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the real point that needs to be pondered on is — which way is the Indian economy itself heading? What we are witnessing today in terms of unabated hikes in fuel prices and a fall in the rupee's value shows how India is unable to resist the cascading effect of changes in the global economy. It is clear that while the political parties are trying to score points over each other, the real issue is being neglected. The core issue is that we have failed to create a swadeshi model of our economy. There is a distinct section of economists which has been a votary of developing an Indian model of economic development and growth. But what successive governments have been doing is trying to find western solutions for India's economic problems. This has been hurting the Indian economy — and this has opened us to all the vulnerabilities of the global economy. It is time to look at developing an economy which is not driven by the western paradigm of 'consumption'-driven models. It is time to develop a model which moves the Indian economy away from 'consumption' and towards a more sustainable development pattern. Also, while the Indian economy may remain integrated with the global economy, it needs to retain its resilience. However, notwithstanding which party's government is at the Centre, not much work has been done in this direction. The Narendra Modi-led government though has given indications by cracking down on foreign consultants in the government and   with a strong western bent of mind with those whose thought process is more rooted in an Indian ecosystem. However, there are no quick solutions to this immediate problem of rising fuel prices and the falling rupee. More than a problem, these are symptoms that we need to review our basic approach towards decision-making when it comes to economic policies. The Modi government has taken some initiatives — it would be better for the political class to come together on this issue instead of playing a blame game that hurts the common person the most.",2018-09-11,"Fuel price hike,Congress,Narendra Modi,Bharat Bandh",Bharat Bandh fizzled out.

196,Minhaz Merchant,"The death toll: 66 children. In two deadly strikes on civilians in  2018, the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition, backed by Britain and the United States, continued its genocidal war on Yemen. For three and a half years, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and several other Arab countries have inflicted a devastating conflict on the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Over  , including countless women and children, have perished in coalition air strikes. The powerful Western media has tried to whitewash the genocide which could not have taken place without lethal Western arms and logistical support. The Yemen genocide is now widely accepted as a war crime. The West’s role in the genocide, especially that of the US and Britain, stands exposed. On August 23, a Saudi-led airstrike south of the   killed 26 children and four women. The Saudis have reluctantly admitted that an error led to the fatalities. They also admitted that an air strike 14 days earlier, on August 9, had killed 40 children in the Houthi-held north of Yemen. Stung by growing international condemnation, Spain, while not a direct combatant in the Yemen war, last week,  the sale of 400 laser-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia. Britain has publicly disparaged indiscriminate airstrikes on Yemeni targets. Privately, it continues to sell billions of dollars worth of advanced weaponry to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. British and American military advisors sit in Saudi war rooms to help target attacks in Yemen and offer logistical and intelligence support. In a report issued two weeks ago, the United Nations  that the Saudi coalition’s airstrikes have done “maximum damage in terms of civilian casualties in Yemen.” By blocking Yemeni ports and air space, the UN report said, the coalition might have “violated international humanitarian norms.” The Yemen war is essentially a proxy battle between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia. The Houthi rebels are backed and armed by Iran. With Arab troops faring badly against the Houthis, Riyadh hired former   in 2016 to lead the coalition’s stuttering effort. If a war crimes tribunal is set up, Sharif too will be incriminated. The Donald Trump administration, so vocal over the Syrian army’s attack on Idlib, the last province held by Saudi-backed rebels, has been notably silent over its role in the Yemen slaughter. Without advanced US fighter jets, other weaponry and logistics, the Saudi coalition would not have been able to prosecute this genocidal war. The role of the Western media has been particularly malignant. As the   an online journal,  on June 19, 2018: “The Saudi coalition, which includes Emirati forces and foreign mercenaries, is fully backed by the US, Britain and France. This coalition says that by taking the port of Hodeidah it will hasten the defeat of Houthi rebels. But to use the cutting off of food and other vital aid to civilian populations as a weapon is a blatant war crime. “As the horror of Hodeida unfolds, Western media has confined its focus narrowly on the humanitarian plight of Hodeidah’s inhabitants and the wider Yemeni population. But British and US journalists have been careful to omit the relevant context, which is that the offensive on Hodeida would not be possible without the crucial military support of Western governments. The BBC, France 24, CNN, Deutsche Welle,   and   are among media outlets spreading misinformation on Yemen. For example, in its report,   did not mention the fact that airstrikes by Saudi and Emirati forces are carried out with American F-15 fighter jets, British Typhoons and French Dassault warplanes.” When confronted with evidence of guilt, Britain is quick to resort to glib non-sequiturs. Alistair Burt, the UK’s Middle East minister,  without a trace of embarrassment: “I think that the hand of the United Kingdom can be seen in the work that we have done with the (Saudi) coalition over time in order to ensure that should things go wrong, there is proper accountability.” Proper accountability is unlikely to be upheld in the Yemen genocide. The Saudi-Western strategy is to neutralise Iranian influence in the Middle East on the pretext that it foments terrorism even though it was the Saudis who funded and armed al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS). Iran’s influence in the Middle East has meanwhile grown. It now extends to Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Qatar and parts of Yemen. Under Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salman, Saudi Arabia has mended fences with Israel in its single-minded attempt to checkmate Iran. US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner is especially close to Mohammad bin-Salman. Trump’s own pathological animosity towards Iran has complicated the Shia-Sunni struggle for domination in the Middle East. In a tactical move, Riyadh has, for the first time. begun wooing the minority Shia population within Saudi Arabia that has been persecuted for decades. Iraq is Shia-majority. Syria’s ruling Alawite sect is Shia-affiliated. Shias are a majority in Bahrain, though its rulers are Sunnis. Lebanon’s powerful militia Hezbollah is Shia. So deeply rooted is Saudi Arabia’s hostility towards Shia Iran (which it calls non-Arab Persia) that Iranian pilgrims were   to this year’s Haj in Mecca. The war crimes in Yemen have highlighted how dangerous Mohammed bin-Salman’s stewardship of Saudi Arabia has become. The US and British governments are coming under increasing pressure to end arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE - they won’t do so, despite the UN castigating their role in the Yemen genocide. For a declining power like Britain in particular, weapons sales to Saudi Arabia are both a source of revenue and a means of maintaining its waning influence in the Middle East. For the Saudis, there was a brief   after the two genocidal air strikes that killed 66 children last month. The Joint Incident Assessment Team (JIAT) set up by the coalition issued this  : “There was a clear delay in preparing the fighter jet at the appropriate time and place, thus losing (the opportunity) to target this bus (carrying women and children) as a military target in an open area in order to avoid such collateral damage. The team believes that the coalition forces should immediately review the application of their rules of engagement to ensure compliance.” Until the Saudis and their Western backers abandon the genocidal war on Yemen, and are tried before a war crimes tribunal (as the Serbian leaders of the Balkans genocide were), that statement will amount to nothing.",2018-09-11,"Britain,US,Saudi Arabia,Yemen Crisis",How Britain and US enabled genocide in Yemen,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/yemen-genocide-saudi-arabia-united-nations-uk-us-america-britain/story/1/26590.html
197,Supriya Bhardwaj,"A ‘houseful’ board was hanging outside the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium where the 84th plenary session of the Congress was being held in March 2018. Congress workers were still roaming outside the stadium, hoping to get that much sought-after entry into the stadium where Congress president Rahul Gandhi was about to speak in his first plenary session as the new chief of the party. 39-year-old Sanjay Pandey, a resident of Mahoba, was one such aspirant. Pandey believed some magic would happen and he would get into the area where Gandhi scion was to speak.  “ ” (Want to see Rahul bhaiya for just once. I am a party worker, but haven’t met him in person ever).  It wasn’t a lucky day for Pandey. But Rahul Gandhi knew the “Dil Ki Baat” of his party workers. Delivering his maiden speech as the new chief of the grand old party, 48-year-old Gandhi listed his topmost priority: to break the barrier between him and the party workers.  “My first priority will be to   between me and party workers,” Gandhi had said then. Then the naysayers wondered how he would break this barrier. But finally, Rahul Gandhi got the ‘shakti’ to break the ‘wall’ between him and his workers.   — an interactive programme — was launched by Gandhi to strengthen the party at the booth level.  On numerous occasions, Gandhi said that he wants to change the culture of the Congress by turning the party from a leader-based party to a cadre-based one. Shakti is doing that for him.  Post-2014, it was said that the Congress’ cadre is eroded and party has lost grassroots support. But now, through Shakti, the Congress is being able to connect with its one crore workers at around three lakh booths across the country. This project has so far been launched in nine states: Rajasthan, MP, Chattisgarh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Bihar and Jharkhand. The party is planning to launch this project in Bengal, UP, Orissa in next seven days.  At 24 Akbar Road, Delhi — the headquarters of the Congress — there is a mundane-looking white room where Congress’ ‘shakti’ is being fomented in the form of the registrations of party workers.  Every second there is a person who is registering himself/ herself and from ‘faceless’ becoming a registered booth worker of the party.  To enroll, people have to send an SMS to a particular number along with their name, voter identification card number, phone number, booth and Vidhan Sabha constituency. And then the Congress analytics department connects with them. The cheery on the cake is a customised phone call from Rahul Gandhi himself, thanking the workers for getting registered. If you are thinking that it ends there, then you are mistaken. These workers and booth managers are then given some tasks, based on which they are scored. Real-time appraisal of their performances is being done on a regular basis. The best performers are given appreciation certificates by Rahul Gandhi himself. This entire process is being monitored and managed by a team of 50 members, including the nation/ state coordinators and analysts of the party.  emerging at various booths, Praveen Chakravarty, chairman, AICC data analyst department said, “Here I want to show you the real cadre of our organisation. It is not a jumla. These people are the hardcore Congress cadre, which many were saying is missing.”  ""We are not in the number game. Rather we are just connecting our workers with the top leadership of the party. We are doing the mapping of booths that we need to focus on; who our workers are and how they are performing,"" Chakravarty said. Through this ‘secret brahmastra’ of Rahul Gandhi, the Congress is able to identify its workers; bringing new workers under the party's fold. Also, these workers are being asked to convince the voters.  Shakti is assisting the Congress in poll-bound states like Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh by helping them to identify dedicated workers at both booth and block levels. Congress leader Ashok Gehlot said, ""This is a revolutionary move. Rajasthan is number one in registration of booth workers. We have 6 lakh workers there. This Data bank will help us to keep history of our workers, roll out schemes and get feedback."" Apart from AICC — the mother organisation — Congress’ frontal organisations — Mahila Congress is launching Mahila Shakti whereas Youth Congress and NSUI are launching Yuva Shakti.  KPCC chief Dinesh Gundu Rao said, ""Through Shakti, senior leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, can instantly connect with all the booth level workers in one go. It's an excellent measure through which we come to know our organisational strength and establish two-way communication with our karyakartas. Barriers between the senior leaders and the workers are actually broken."" Rahul Gandhi has termed Shakti as “the anchor for the future of the party”. Seems he has got the formula to steer the ship in these uneasy sea.",2018-09-11,"Lok Sabha election 2019,Rahul Gandhi,Congress,Shakti project",Hidden Congress cadre emerges.

198,Ifra Jan,"As the pride marches began unfurling their rainbow umbrellas on a drizzly day in Delhi, celebrating the Supreme Court of India's decision to strike down the IPC section that criminalised 'unnatural' sex, it was just another day of exclusion and quiet for the LGBTQ community in Kashmir. While the Indian Penal Code does not apply to J&K, the Ranbir Penal Code, compiled by the erstwhile Hindu Dogra Rulers of the state, in its Article 377, criminalises 'unnatural' sex. However, the Supreme Court ruling striking down a similar provision in the IPC effectively renders the Ranbir Penal Code Art 377 void — since under the  , the Supreme Court's jurisdiction has been extended to the state of J&K. Subreen Malik, an advocate and founder of the Kashmir Women's Collective, says: ""Had the Indian Parliament struck down Article 377, we would have needed a parallel Presidential Order to strike down RPC 377. But since it was the SC that struck it down, it makes the RPC 377 a 'dead law'."" But while the state has been forced to decriminalise our sexual preferences, what does one do when the violence — broken skulls and broken spirits — comes not from the usual suspect, the state, but the family? The transgender community in Kashmir gave their first detailed interviews to Aijaz Bund, the first researcher to do an extensive anthropological study of the community in Kashmir. This was compiled into a book called   The stories one reads begin with how and when it was discovered that transwomen were not inherently fitting into the heteronormative binaries of Male and Female, and a saga of brutality and abandonment followed. It was the families that remained the principle perpetrators of physical violence, mostly male members inflicting regular beatings and extensive psychological torture on sexual minorities — so much so, that after a point, the Hijras were not left with much of a choice but to run away to sleep on the footpaths, often as teenagers. With no money, no family to back them up, no education, no place to call home, they end up getting sucked into series and hierarchies of exploitative societal structures. Abandonment, one of the fears that every individual harbours, is something they have all had to face. ""One of our friends lay dying on a footpath, and he died on that road among dogs and garbage. Nobody touched him,"" a prominent trans-voice in Kashmir said during Dr Aijaz Bund's book launch last year, which had been organised by the Kashmir Women's Collective. Dignity apart, the discrimination against their being pushes them to the margins in many other ways. When a teenage boy is thrown out of the house, when school mates bully queer kids, they are left with little choice but to be school drop-outs. Most formal economic channels are closed to them, but even informal economic avenues shun them. Few choices remain: match-making and singing. With arranged marriages taking a back seat, as Kashmiri society progresses, and as women and men choose their own partners, singing remains the last ""dignified"" occupation available to them. But occupations that sustain you when you're young may not as your body ages. “I am nearing 60, how long will my throat have the strength to sing for hours at a time?”, said Reshma, who ironically shot to fame as one of her singing video clips went viral. It is old age that they dread. With no pension, no children, no siblings, and acute social stigmatisation, they live and die on the margins. Yet, the identity that they seek is within the confines of Muslim society — they are no rebels against Muslim society. When I questioned them about the  criminalising homosexuality, the answer was unanimous. They all welcomed the judgement! It baffled me, but truth is often found in shades of grey. They accepted the judgement because it was in consonance with Islamic rulings, which frown upon same-sex love. They wished to carve for themselves an identity which was an intrinsic part of the orthodox Muslim world. The dominant sentiment being: ""  (It is God who created us). So, how can our Kashmiri Muslim brothers and sisters shun us?” When they reach out to the Muslim majority in the state to accept them as a part and not as rebels, they leave out the gays and lesbians. The trans-men and women I spoke to were unanimous in making clear and bold the distinction between themselves and homosexuals. “They cannot be allowed to be a part of such a pious society” and “What they do is a sin” came the responses. While the internal politics of the LGTBQ in the mainland remains, yet there is a cohesiveness — of being queer — that binds them at another level. As they wave their rainbow flags, they march together. Kashmir is another story. Kashmir has a history of gay love and liasons, so much so that the Kashmiri language has a name for them, ' . Pre-2000 Kashmir allowed for cultural and sexual diversity, a permissiveness that disappeared as a Wahhabi outlook and thought have spread in the Valley. Gay and lesbian love remained forbidden in the theocratic texts throughout, but when heterosexual majorities mostly were not even aware of such ""deviances"", they could hardly police them. It was this thin cloak of acceptability, along with secrecy, that allowed gay men to live with their partners. But later, in the post-liberalisation era, as cable TV became a household thing, so did homophobia. As religious channels like Peace TV read out the texts and the punishments in details, pronouncing every sin and quoting every divine verse, they trampled on the ""grey zone"" that Kashmiri society had lived through years, eating mutton on some days, being vegetarian in reverence of a peer on others. Now, you are either a Muslim or an apostate. In this environment, gays and lesbians in Kashmir never even had a public organised meeting, let alone put up a strong, brave, organised front that the Queer community in other parts of India has. Even in the most ""liberal"" gatherings, they are not talked about publicly. They are not only excluded from public spaces, in bare contrast to the mainland, they are also excluded from books, local newspapers and magazines. No Queer theory is discussed in colleges in Kashmir, no Simon De Beauvoir is read there. In a place that's facing the doldrums of conflict, there is little space for sexual minorities amid the dominant narratives. ""How many people died today?"" remains the daily headline, crushing every other thought. I wonder what the detailed 400-page judgement of the Supreme Court would mean to a community that hides behind the stigma of apostasy, of being the followers of ' ', and users of fake Facebook accounts. The judgement talked of constitutional rights being paramount over majoritarian morality. The law may surely protect sexual minorities from the state — but who will save the gays and lesbians of Kashmir from their own fathers and brothers? In a society in which there are militaries and armed insurgents, more hierarchies and layers of power emerge. In an  called the ' ', Rekha slowly narrates gory details of how in an army crackdown, she was forced by the state forces to dance in front of a huge crowd, which also included her family members. ""  (what could they do)? We were all helpless,"" she says. A Kashmiri student, Sofi Owais Talib, narrated his childhood memories of being brought up by a loving transgender, Bashir. Bashir would be humiliated every time he went out — he was laughed at, mocked, but he never said a word back. He would simply cry in silence. But worse was yet to come. Bashir was abducted and raped by a neighbour — who also happened to be a local militant commander. No person in his senses could dare file an FIR against the militant. Bashir was humiliated and broken and left the house, when helpless Sofi was a child. Ever since, no one has heard of him. I wonder if Bashir is alive, if he saw on TV the jubilation of the pride marches. I wonder what he felt as the rainbows marched, men kissed in the rain, and celebrated the 400-page verdict which was read out loud on every news channel. What did Bashir think when Justice Indu Malhotra declared that history owed the LGBTQ community an apology? But then, unlike his counterparts in Delhi, who fight in the courts, teach in universities, kiss in the rain, Bashir was a school drop-out who neither understood English, nor Queer Theory. The celebrated 377 verdict will remain a fig leaf, unless taken to the Queer community of Kashmir that survives on the margins.",2018-09-10,"Kashmir,Lgbtq rights,Homosexuality,Section 377","Section 377 verdict: Legally safe, socially targetted, Kashmir's LGBTQ face a huge challenge of acceptance",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/section-377-homosexuality-lgbtq-rights-supreme-court-kashmir-militancy/story/1/26560.html
199,Anand Kochukudy,"In the wake of the   against its lawmaker PK Sasi, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is on the backfoot in Kerala. Although the complainant — a Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) district Secretariat member — first reached out to CPI(M) state Secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and Politburo member Brinda Karat, it was only after   the complaint to CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury (and his subsequent confirmation of receiving the complaint) that the matter came into the public domain.  An impression has since gained ground that the party sat on the charges levelled against its influential MLA. While the CPI(M) state leadership refused to confirm the existence of the complaint prior to Yechury’s disclosure, the party has continued to tiptoe around the issue, even after it tumbled out. Last Friday (September 7), the state Secretariat of the CPI(M) issued a carefully-worded   on the issue. But that has actually complicated things since many of the claims in the communiqué runs counter to the assertions of party leaders since Tuesday (September 4), when the matter first surfaced in the media. For instance, the statement claims the state Secretary (Kodiyeri Balakrishnan) took cognisance of the complaint he received on August 14 and heard the complainant out and followed it up by summoning the accused MLA for a hearing at the party headquarters. But as late as this Tuesday, the MLA claimed ignorance about the  . Moreover, the statement says the party Secretariat was briefed about the matter by Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on August 31, where a resolution was passed to institute an internal inquiry Commission, consisting of Minister AK Balan and PK Sreemathi. But, on September 4, the same AK Balan was on record, saying he didn’t have any knowledge of the complaint. It’s clear that either the CPI(M) state Secretariat or the Law Minister of Kerala are lying. The next question — is it not incumbent upon the party to forward a criminal complaint it receives to the police? The CPI(M) apparatchiks, who often take a high moral ground on women’s issues, seem to think that Comrades aren’t to be subjected to the law, like mere mortals. Even the Kerala Women’s Commission — chaired by CPI(M) Central Committee member MC Josephine — has   suo moto cognisance of the complaint. The Women’s Commission — a statutory body — has quasi-judicial powers and can summon a copy of the complaint received by the state Secretary of the CPI(M), according to legal experts. It is clear that the Commission’s political affiliation prevents it from acting on the matter.   There have many attempts to apparently influence and coerce the victim into withdrawing the complaint if reports in the   daily are to be believed. The offers reportedly range from money to leadership positions in the DYFI. Such reports might severely dent the morale of women Comrades in leadership positions today — along with the impressionable young women in DYFI. While the CPI(M) tries to project themselves as a progressive and gender-sensitive party, the history of the party, leading up to the present, presents a vastly different reality. In the 1987 assembly elections in Kerala, the Marxists projected KR Gowri as the face of the campaign. It was assumed that she would be nominated as the chief minister if the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) came to power. The campaign slogan used to be — “ ” (Kerala, the land of the coconut trees, will elect KR Gowri as the chief minister/ruler). In the end, EK Nayanar was the chosen one. KR Gowri still bears witness to the treachery of her Comrades, at the ripe old age of 99 today. Misogyny aside, there have been serious cases of sexual harassment and moral turpitude raised against its senior leaders, even in the not so distant past. PK Sasi’s namesake P Sasi’s case is still fresh — in fact, it’s almost a case of déjà vu for the Marxist party. P Sasi was the powerful Kannur district Secretary of the party in 2010 when a case of sexual harassment was levelled against him by the  . Although the party reportedly tried to shield him, a similar complaint by the-then Thaliparamba MLA, CKP Padmanabhan, against Sasi for allegedly harassing his daughter, put paid to it. With the central leadership standing firm, the CPI(M) Kerala state Committee’s initial disciplinary action to suspend Sasi for a year had to be revised to expulsion in mid-2011. In the same year, another towering CPI(M) district Secretary — the Ernakulam District Secretary Gopi Kottamurickal — was embroiled in yet another reported sex scandal. He was also shown the door. Both expelled district Secretaries continued to be closely associated with the party through feeder organisations and made their back eventually. In fact, P Sasi went back to his practice as a lawyer and defended the Marxists named in the political murders of Comrade TP Chandrasekharan and Kathiroor Manoj. Come 2018, both P Sasi and Gopi Kottamuickal are back in the CPI(M) — Kottamurickal even made it back to the state Committee of the party in the last CPI(M) state Conference. What happened to CKP Padmanabhan and the young DYFI comrade who complained about Sasi? Padmanabhan, a former state President of the feeder organisation “Kerala Karshaka Sangham”, was first relegated to the branch (the lowest in the party structure) from the state Committee for alleged “financial misappropriation” within months and is not active in politics anymore. Even the young DYFI Comrade also found himself out of party ranks soon. One hopes the young woman who complained against PK Sasi doesn’t end up getting victimised by the vindictive Comrades on some other pretext. Prominent Left ideologues, like Appukkuttan Vallikkunnu and Dr Azad, have written about the blatant double standards practised by the CPI(M) in sacking Padmanabhan, citing “financial misappropriation” (merely on account of his position as the President of the feeder organisation) while conveniently forgiving EP Jayarajan for more serious charges of financial malpractice. Such hypocrisy isn’t the sole preserve of Kerala Marxists. Brinda Karat’s seeming double standards on the matter need to be recounted — especially since Karat apparently received a copy of the complaint forwarded by the young woman three weeks ago. When the sexual harassment case involving journalist Tarun Tejpal was sought to be handled internally by the then-managing editor of  , Shoma Choudhary, in 2013, Karat wrote  in  . She wrote: “If other rapists locked up in the jails of India had been beneficiaries of such an (in-house) approach, they would all be lining up at the doors of their victims, offering their apologies, promising months of atonement. It is easier after all to atone in the circle of loving friends and families than to face the law and the consequences of your crime.” But she seems to have a different yardstick when it comes to her fellow Comrades of the CPI(M). Five years later, Karat seems to be banking on the “agency” (of the victim) argument dished out by those defending Tehelka back then. I got in touch with Brinda Karat to seek a clarification on her stand. When I reminded her about her arguments from 2013, she claimed the victim in Tejpal’s case was “under pressure” then to not approach the police (unlike the victim in the present case). For a prominent female politician who understands the ways of patriarchy and the power enjoyed by the party ruling a state, it is unclear how she assumed the victim in the present case isn’t under duress. On being contacted, Comrade Subhashini Ali, the other female Politburo member, too sought to distance herself from the matter. One can only hope the complainant in PK Sasi’s case musters up the courage to go public for the law to take its course.

201,Sushant Sareen,"In a country that thrives on conspiracy theories, the book most often quoted these days by business executives and CAs pretending to be economists is   by John Perkins. Pakistan’s new finance minister, Asad Umar, never tires of quoting from Perkins book to explain the economic bankruptcy staring Pakistan in the face, and how Pakistan has been deliberately indebted by his corrupt and incompetent predecessors to foreign creditors who will now squeeze it dry to extract not just their money but also political and strategic concessions. Ironically, even as Umar and others of his ilk keep parroting the Perkins line to paint the West as the evil force that has ensnared Pakistan in debt, they conveniently gloss over the fact that the one country that today represents the textbook model of the Perkins conspiracy theory is Pakistan’s "" "" — China. In the second decade of the 21st century, China has steadily replaced the US and other Western countries as Pakistan’s principal patron and partner. China is today Pakistan’s largest trading partner, main weapons supplier, biggest investor, and top most lender. Diplomatically, politically, economically and to an extent even militarily, China is virtually underwriting Pakistan. Although the Chinese plead a degree of altruism in their treatment of Pakistan, there is a major strategic dimension to the relationship, not the least of which is the utility of Pakistan is keeping India tied down. This serves not just Chinese interests but also Pakistan’s, and is in many ways the glue that binds the two together. In recent years, however, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has added an economic dimension to the relationship. On the face of it, the Chinese investments in CPEC is a win-win for both countries. But increasingly it is becoming clear that the price tag attached to the CPEC might actually be unaffordable for Pakistan and could bind it into a trap from which it will find it difficult to extricate itself. Already there are signs of growing disquiet inside Pakistan over the financial implications of CPEC. The Pakistan Senate has been asking tough questions on the revolving fund of 22 billion dollars to ensure timely payments to Chinese power firms that have set up plants under CPEC. A number of other projects have got stalled, some because the Chinese are going slow on account of political uncertainty and others because Pakistanis have run out of funds to finance their side of some road projects. The new government is also promising to make public the CPEC contracts and not only re-negotiate but also review some of these projects, something that isn’t likely to go down well with the Chinese. While the Pakistanis are continuing to give a positive spin to the CPEC and projecting it as a game-changer, the brave face they are putting to the mounting current account deficits, rising indebtedness and the ever-widening financing gap isn’t really convincing anyone. The bottom line is that the sums are not matching and there is something seriously wrong with the Pakistan economy which cannot be fixed by merely pumping more money into the economy in the hope of tiding over the looming payments crisis. Many Pakistanis claim that the current account deficit is the result of machinery imports under the CPEC. This is projected as being something positive for the economy, the temporary crisis notwithstanding. But the problem is that machinery imports are not the primary driver behind the rising trade deficit. More intriguingly, while Pakistanis claim that machinery imports are rising, this isn’t being reflected either in a commensurate rise in foreign direct investment or even in overall investment in the economy. With the productive capacities of the Pakistan economy not rising in tandem with the rising debt obligations, servicing the debt (or even providing an attractive return on the investments) will remain a major drag on the Pakistan economy. The Pakistanis are for now going around with a begging bowl to the Chinese and the Saudis and hoping that an infusion of funds will help them tide over the immediate crisis. But the crisis confronting the economy is not a stock issue that can be addressed with a one shot injection of funds. This is a structural crisis, one that will persist over the next few years at the very minimum. Unless the Chinese are ready to inject billions of dollars year after year to foot the bill for Pakistanis’ propensity to live beyond their means, the Pakistanis will have no choice but to approach the IMF once again. This will mean a major structural adjustment which will be not only painful but also bring down the debt-fuelled growth rates. With growth rates falling, the premise on which Pakistan was taking loans will collapse, and will in turn push them further into the vice-like grip of China. The Pakistani playbook is to threaten the rest of the world to bail them out to prevent them from getting ensnared by the Chinese. Some Indian strategists are even suggesting that India reach out to Pakistan and do what it can to prevent Pakistan’s inexorable slide into becoming a virtual client, if not a colony of China. But frankly, this is a specious argument because nothing that India or the US does is going to prevent Pakistan from becoming a Chinese vassal. More importantly, there is nothing that either India or the US should do to prevent Pakistan from becoming a Chinese colony. This is for two reasons: one, there are bound to be glaring contradictions between China and an Islamic state of Pakistan and these will manifest themselves sooner rather than later if Pakistan gets caught into the debt trap of the Chinese; second, neither India nor US exercise the influence required to change Pakistani behaviour. China might be the only country with the heft to do this. If as a result of the contradictions between Godless and infidel China and an Islamised Pakistan, the nexus between these two countries starts fraying, it suits India. On the other hand, if for their own interests, China exerts influence to normalise Pakistan and gets it off its Islamist hobby-horse by nudging, pushing and shoving it to clean up its act, it also suits India.

202,Tuhin A Sinha,"On August 20, at the prayer meeting for Atal Bihari Vajpayee, when Farooq Abdullah stumped everybody with loud  , one had hoped they were chants of redemption. One had hoped at the fag end of his career, he was repentant for squandering away some golden opportunities for Kashmir, purely for his selfish interests. But instead, as it turns out today, that patriotic fervour was conjured up for another selfish motive. It was yet another desperate survival manoeuvre of trying a collaboration with the BJP. And when that wasn't entertained, in no time, Farooq was back at his vicious game of political blackmail, something he apparently inherited as legacy from his father, the late Sheikh Abdullah. I have written extensively on Kashmir and hence today, I would not tread so far back as the days of Sheikh Abdullah. What saddens me today is that even in the twilight of his career, Farooq seems determined to stick to the only formula the local parties of Kashmir know — while in power, pretend to align yourself to the Indian establishment; when out of power, stoke secessionist elements you've nurtured as back-up. This competitive soft separatism shamelessly goes on ad nauseum between the NC and the PDP, disregarding the genuine interests of the state. Coming to the forthcoming panchayat and local body polls, there are three major reasons why both the NC and PDP find themselves in complete disarray. One, for the first time, both the NC and PDP are faced with their biggest credibility crisis. Large sections of Kashmir are disillusioned with the opportunistic politics of the Abdullahs and Muftis, and blame them for the messy state of affairs in the state. In fact, sections within both the NC and PDP are so upset with their party bosses, they have been sending feelers to the BJP and want to subscribe to the positive, straight-talk of the BJP. In this situation, both the NC and the PDP are naturally jittery and resorting to wilder gimmicks to stay in circulation. The   is that absurd gimmick aimed at disruption. It is competitive soft separatism — bordering on treachery. Two, panchayat and local body elections go beyond politics. In a state where Governor's Rule is imposed, the elected representatives gain direct access with the Central government. Moreover, local bodies and panchayats have a pivotal role to play in the last-mile deliverance of key social welfare schemes of the government. This scenario again makes the NC and PDP insecure — they want the villages to remain deprived of government schemes. That creates the right breeding ground for the politics of the NC and PDP. It needs to be noted here that even in the worst of situations in recent years, the NDA government has tried to get governance going at the grassroots level through the panchayats.

They want to move on. They see a prosperous and peaceful future with India. And this jeopardises the core of the NC and PDP's politics. Instead of attempting course correction and mainstreaming their politics, the local parties have taken the vicious and regressive route of filling up the space left by separatists.

203,Harsh V Pant,"The first edition of the   has once again underlined that Donald Trump notwithstanding, this bilateral relationship retains its positive trajectory. It was difficult to do this under the present circumstances where every small irritant is seen to be dismantling the underlying strength of India-US ties. But the two nations managed to do a credible job. This is especially true of the Modi government which could have easily shelved the landmark  or Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement till after elections. Yet it took the risk and underscored that robust ties with the US are necessary even at a time when there seems to be a reset in Sino-Indian ties and Russian President will be visiting New Delhi next month. The inaugural dialogue touched upon all the relevant aspects from defence cooperation and trade ties to the changing contours of the Indo-Pacific and India’s entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The two nations showed a concerted toughness towards Pakistan and called for an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process in Afghanistan. The divergences pertaining to Russia and Iran sanctions were craftily underplayed. India shares an interesting relationship with the US. While many in India would like to pretend that New Delhi couldn’t care less about Washington, every sign emanating from Washington is also overanalysed. The reality is that India’s relations with the US have today matured enough that underlying structural and institutional variables can propel the bilateral relationship in a positive direction for quite some time. Both in India and the US, top political leaderships, cutting across party lines, are invested in making this relationship work. Even a US presidency as transactional as Donald Trump’s has largely made all the right noises about India. Prime Minister Modi has argued that India and the US have overcome ""the hesitations of history"" under the Obama administration. He wooed the Trump administration during his initial outreach when he suggested that “the convergence of my vision for ‘New India’ and President Trump’s vision for making America great again will add new dimensions to our cooperation.” He managed to steer Trump towards the larger structural realities that have driven the India-US relationship since George W Bush declared that America would help India emerge as a global power. Trump’s South Asia strategy has also taken Indian concerns into account and his emphasis on the ""Indo-Pacific"" is in tune with Indian thinking. There are indeed problems and in a relationship as broad and deep as India-US, that should be par for the course. There’s the persistent Iran question which has come to the fore with the US asking all countries, including India, to reduce oil imports from Iran to zero by November 4. Indian companies will be facing sanctions if India fails to comply. The Trump Administration has taken a maximalist position on Iran and it is willing to brook no dissent in the matter. India’s defence ties with Russia is another point of contention as India is in the   surface to-air missile systems from Russia. As per the US law called ""Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act"" (CAATSA), sanctions can be imposed on countries that engage in significant transactions with any of the listed 39 Russian companies. India has close defence ties with Russia and the Indian armed forces remain highly dependent on Russia — from cooperation on strategic technologies to supply of spares, maintenance repair and overhaul. Trade is the third leg of this triad that is generating tension with the Trump administration pushing Delhi to lower its trade barriers. Trump has accused India (along with other major economies) of charging 100 per cent tariff on some of the US’ goods, threatening to cut trade ties with them. India has announced its retaliatory tariff on 29 US products worth $235 million to come into effect on August 4, in response to the US move to unilaterally raise import duties on Indian steel and aluminium. Together these issues have raised the spectre of India-US ties once again going back to the good old days of recriminations and wrangling. But there have always been issues on which the US and India had been on the opposite sides. Even when the US-India civil nuclear pact was being negotiated, India’s ties with Iran were brought up by interested parties to derail the process. Today, when Iran has bounced back, India is not the only nation being targeted by Washington. On all the three issues of contention, the US is challenging the rest of the world and in all the three cases, India is not really the central player. The Russia case is different and the Trump administration has also defended India at the US Congress, calling for an exemption for India. While the Trump administration’s transactional approach is generating some turbulence in the India-US relationship, New Delhi retains the ability to confidently bear this out as the fundamentals of the relationship remain as strong as ever. As a self-confident emerging power, India should take the lead in shaping the terms of engagement of its partnership with the US, rather than getting carried away by the surrounding noise. If the outcome of the recent 2+2 dialogue is any indication, New Delhi is learning this art quickly.

204,Supriya Bhardwaj,"It was a lazy, sultry Sunday afternoon. Amid hectic poll campaigning for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, all eyes were on a 'nukkar sabha' in Maharajganj in Rae Bareli. Congress’ star campaigner Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was about to speak. At that time, she was leading the campaign battle from the front, forcing the BJP to 'run for cover'.  On April 27, 2014 too, everyone expected a cracker of an innings from her. But then the BJP fired its brahmastra — a   titled ‘Damad Shree’, targeting Priyanka Gandhi's husband, Robert Vadra, a businessman.  During the entire 2014 poll campaign, BJP leaders, including their PM candidate Narendra Modi, screamed on top of their voices about alleged land deals (in Haryana) of the then Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law by terming it as ""Robert Vadra model of development"". I clearly remember, how Priyanka Gandhi had reacted at Maharajganj when someone from the media broke the news about BJP’s 'Damad Shree' campaign.  She   that the BJP would resort to lies before polls. "" ...  .  .   (They are scrambling like panic-stricken rats... let them do what they want, I am not scared of anyone and won't sit silent. I will continue to speak up).” Post-2014 polls, the BJP came to power — both at the Centre and the state — and FIRs were registered against Vadra. Soon, the   was set up. Recently, another FIR has been registered against Vadra, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and two companies in an alleged land scam in Gurgaon.  However, it seems things are a bit different now. The BJP and PM Narendra Modi are facing severe attacks over the Rafale deal and demonetisation from the Congress led by party president Rahul Gandhi.  According to Congress insiders, the BJP in Haryana is miffed with the fact that Hooda's rallies are a big hit across the state. Also, the BJP was already on the back foot due to demonetisation, job shortage and farm crisis and now Rafale deal. So, they are resorting to their tried and tested formula — target Vadra — to corner the Congress. The BJP, however, is maintaining that their governments — both at the Centre and the state — are serious about cracking the whip on corruption-related issues. The Congress, in the meanwhile, is firing on all cylinders against the BJP, saying that the latest police complaint against Vadra is nothing but an attempt to divert attention from core issues like the Rafale deal and demonetisation. The Congress’ stand: ""As Assembly elections in four states and next year's general elections are drawing near, the fake news factory and 'dirty tricks department' of the Modi government and the BJP are working overtime."" Interestingly, after the registration of the FIR, the Gurgaon Police, probing the illegal land dealing involving Vadra and Hooda, are still waiting for a go ahead from the state government. The Gurgaon Police have   to the DGP of Haryana on September 1, seeking permission from the state government to investigate the case. The permission is required as the case has been lodged under Section 17 (a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. After the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and later the Assembly elections in Haryana, much water has flowed under the bridge. But the cases against Vadra and Hooda still are stuck in the 'prosecution' pipeline. Interestingly, both the accused and the accuser are asking for just one thing — “justice”. IAS officer  , the whistleblower in the case, recently tweeted: “Dhingra Commission of inquiry was wastage of time and public money. What a private man could do now, the state government could have done three years earlier. They had access to official records and my reports of May 21, 2013 and February 12, 2015.  Shielding the corrupt is also a corrupt act.”  On the other hand, Hooda said, “I also want that the truth should come out. I have done no wrong.” The BJP, meanwhile, has tweaked its strategy — from addressing Vadra as “Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law” to “Rahul Gandhi’s brother-in-law”. BJP spokespersons during media interactions are heard referring to Vadra as “Rahul Gandhi’s brother-in-law”, trying to remind people how Vadra is connected to the new Congress president. The BJP is also asking why Vadra has not explained anything on the land deal issue so far. According to BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli, “The matter has been in public domain for some time. Till date, Vadra has not offered any explanation as to how his company could earn such profits without any undue influence from the then Congress government in Haryana. Also, if all transactions are legitimate and not illegal, then why has he shied away from providing all facts to clear the allegations against him.”  Shiv Bhatia, media advisor to Hooda, hit back saying, “The BJP always take out 'Vadra genie' whenever there is an election, or the party is on a sticky wicket. Now they are completely spooked out because of the Rafale case. So to divert attention they got this half-baked FIR registered. The Gurgaon commissioner is seeking permission to investigate the case. ""This is really bizarre that without evidence they file an FIR and then seek permission to probe. What does it show? This is nothing but political vendetta.”  Countering the Congress' stand, Kohli said, “Vadra and the Congress party, which rushes to his defence, cannot argue from both sides. They didn't provide any explanation in the first place, and now that an investigation is taking place, they are shouting that this is a witch hunt. If Vadra is innocent, the best option is to join the investigation and provide details of his version, instead of making allegations against the BJP.”  While the BJP and the Congress is fighting it out, India Inc is closely watching the developments. “It’s election season and more and more corporates, businessmen, will be targeted by various political parties for electoral gains. Don’t forget Vadra is a businessman,” said an industralist who didn't wish to be named.  Political observers, however, believe the BJP‘s “target Vadra” campaign has lost its sheen.   “The voters are not fools. They will also question the BJP. Why does it raise the Vadra issue every time it is unable to counter corruption charges against the party levelled by the Congress,” said a political analyst.  Though adage goes ""innocent till proven guilty"", Vadra will have to face more FIRs and attacks in this poll season.",2018-09-05,"Sonia Gandhi,Priyanka Gandhi,Congress,Robert Vadra","Target Vadra - Cornered on Rafale, BJP resorts to its tried and tested formula",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/robert-vadra-congress-priyanka-gandhi-sonia-gandhi/story/1/26477.html
205,Sanjukta Basu,"The BJP government came to power mainly on an anti-corruption plank. For about a year leading up to the 2014 general election, Narendra Modi relentlessly campaigned against the incumbent UPA government raking up core issues such as fuel prices, jobs, infrastructure, growth, development and so on. At the forefront of the campaign however was a massive anti-corruption drive and rightly so because no amount of efficient governance will truly develop the nation unless there is a will and a way to eradicate corruption. Corruption is the cancer in the nation's body, hard to diagnose, harder to treat and it eats away the nation's wealth. Octogenarian Shantonu Sen belonged to the first batch of CBI officers who joined the organisation at the time of its inception in 1963. He served for 33 years, and retired as the joint director of CBI. He knows a thing or two about bureaucratic and political corruption. In a   when asked about the possible reasons why there has not been any progress in the anti-corruption drive as promised by the BJP government, including the promise of Lokpal, he said, ""neara bel talaye kabar jaye"" [which roughly translates to 'how many times does a vulnerable person fall into the trap?'] is debatable, but the Indian voters have already fallen into the trap a bit too many times all in the name of anti-corruption drive."" In a breaking news development this week, a FIR was filed by a mysterious person, who remains untraceable since then, against Robert Vadra, husband of Priyanka Gandhi alleging that Vadra bought some land by forging cheques and other documents. Details of the allegations are not important, suffice it to say that these were exactly the same allegations against Vadra which were first hurled in 2013 by the ex-bureaucrat turned anti-corruption crusader turned full time politician in the race for chief ministership of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, followed by BJP and other political leaders across parties, catapulting him into the Indian political scene as a key factor. It's time for Indian voters to bite the corruption bait once again. Bold media headlines and prime time TV debate vilifying Robert Vadra relying upon a mere FIR makes for great optics, phonetics and semiotics for the distressed voter who is traumatised by decades of corruption and presently crushed under the rising fuel prices and falling value of rupee. Indian voters are ready to go empty stomach for nights and stand in ATM queues to get hold of their own money as long as they are made to believe that the pain they are undergoing is meant to eradicate corruption of the rich people. But they are often unable to think through important questions like why is media creating a hype around an FIR containing same allegations which were first known five years back but remained unsubstantiated? Why has there been no action in these five years? If this is a real corruption case against public officials then why is the present government not initiating action instead of a private person filing FIR? Moreover, this is only an FIR, there is still a long way to go before any of the charges can be proved, and Vadra can be put behind bars, so what's the Modi jai jaikar for? It is puzzling why the Modi government failed to take action against Vadra. In 2013, the body of 'evidence' against him seemed to be quite large, starting with the testimony of whistleblower Ashok Khemka, IAS officer from Haryana cadre, who first exposed the discrepancy in Vadra's land deals and later got a   in Haryana, or  , who demanded a detailed investigation against Vadra claiming he had enough evidence to nail the latter. Several media organisations also conducted their own investigations and came up with their own 'evidence' and 'testimonies'. Like a dramatic symphony, the music was getting louder and louder moving towards a climax but as soon as the 2014 elections were over, there was a sudden dull thud of a damp squib, and a pin drop silence thereafter. The charges have now returned once again to capture the imagination of Indian voters gearing up for the Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand elections this year, and the general elections next year. Look at the timing of the FIR. In the last few months, here is what has been happening in 'new India': a) A government-backed forum presented a back series GDP report that showed India grew at 10.8 per cent in 2006-07 under PM Manmohan Singh's leadership, which was so embarrassing that it had to be  . b) After shifting goal posts for over two years in their attempt to justify demonetisation, the Reserve Bank of India's damning report has  . c) Fuel prices are rising and the value of rupee against dollar is falling on a daily basis, every day being a new high and new low. d) BJP's own minister admitted  . e) The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has unearthed a  , which is also allegedly linked to the murder of Gauri Lankesh, and three other rationalists. The ATS is now   on Sanatan Sanstha. f) There is massive social unrest in the country with mob lynching, communal hate, caste-based agitations led by Dalits, Marathas, Patidars among others and a growing fear of fascist onslaught as journalists are being made to quit, fired or silenced; human rights activists are put in jail without valid grounds. g) Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi is   as he keeps showing the contrast between him and Modi, and positions himself as the real alternative to hate. In such trying times, unless BJP blinds the Indian voters with the kaleidoscopic dream of the rich corrupt man going to jail, their empty stomachs and angry minds will ask questions.

206,Gautam Chikermane,"It’s 10 days to the 10th anniversary of the   – and it seems no lessons have been learnt on how to manage crises. The collapse that led to what is known as the ‘global economic crisis’ is rearing its head again. From fiscally weak national budgets to excessive and unsustainable sovereign debt, potential financial disasters in emerging economies are rearing their heads, one nation at a time, from Pakistan to Indonesia. These have economic implications, of course – falling currencies, high deficits, rising inflation rates, economic vulnerabilities, debt servicing. Equally, there are severe non-financial import of these crises that can reach into the very innards of the sovereignties of these fragile nations. For now, despite the Indian rupee hitting an  , India stands strong fundamentally. However, it remains vulnerable to the herd mentality of currency and stock market speculators. But first, a look at the global crisis map. At Rs 123 to a dollar, the Pakistani rupee is down by a fifth in the past 12 months, following a balance of payments tension. Making matters worse is the external vulnerabilities of this global terror hub, particularly due to the rising medium-term external repayment obligations linked to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Between   and external financing needs, Pakistan’s requirements have risen to 7.5% of its $313 billion GDP.  With the US holding back $800 million in aid, and likely to prevent it from getting an IMF bailout, as it will be used to pay back the Chinese loan, the deep state of Pakistan, that has neutered the civilian government and runs the country, will need a 180-degree rethink on its terror activities. The choice is clear but action on it would mean rethinking Pakistan, impossible at best. On 5 September, the Indonesian rupiah   in 20 years: at 14,971 to the dollar, this is its weakest level since 1998, and is down 9% since January 2018 and 14% over the past 12 months. Most of this is because of external factors – global volatility, uncertainty around US interest rates, and slowing down of China. These are accentuating internal factors such as reliance on non-resident financing of the fiscal and corporate sector debt. But if the rupiah continues to fall, as trends suggest, the cost of these debts will rise and bring vulnerability to the trillion-dollar economy. While Indonesian banks remain stable and systemic financial risks are under control, legacy issues of non-performing loans stand at 10%. A stronger US dollar could be disruptive for the rupiah. While its central bank, Bank Indonesia, is doing its bit by widening its pool of hedging tools, financial hardships, in the form of inflation and possible austerity, are expected ahead – for which President Joko Widodo has little room for manoeuvre, given that the country goes in for general elections in April 2019. The value of the   since the beginning of the year, following sanctions by the US, finally throwing the country off the financial precipice of high inflation of more than 17% – the highest in 15 years – and a large current account deficit of 5.5%. Irrespective of how strong the leader may be, such a high inflation rate has the potential to shake the political foundations of President Recep Tayyip Edrogan. These financial outbreaks are really symptoms of larger and unresolved problems – in 2017, Turkey’s net FDI declined to less than 1% of GDP, while its net international reserves fell by 13%. The $850 billion economy has large gross external financing needs, low reserves and dependence on short-term capital inflows, making it vulnerable to global volatility. Following the halving of the value of the peso to 38 from 17 a year ago, Argentina has increased interest rates in its $637 billion economy by 15 percentage points to 60%. The already high inflation rate has jumped to more than 30% in July 2018, from less than 25% six months earlier. In a December 2017 report, the IMF had alerted the country about the markets perceiving the currency as being significantly out of line with medium-term fundamentals. The resultant adjustment could lead to an increase in public debt-GDP ratio. Announcing an   and as a precursor to a $50 billion IMF bailout, President Mauricio Macri has pushed for new austerity measures – cut spending and increase export taxes to reduce its budget deficit. A loan from China, under its infamous Belt and Road Initiative, to Montenegro, has put the Balkan nation on the   – on a debt that adds up to 19% of its $4.8 billion GDP, the rising dollar has raised the cost of the loan by 13% and taken the country’s debt-GDP ratio to 78%. The Bar-Boljare highway project, that aims to connect Montenegro’s coast with landlocked Serbia, is creating fiscal pressures. Accentuating these are political pressures on public debt. A strange case of what is known as ‘unilateral Euroisation’ – the country uses the Euro without being part of the EU – Montenegro has no independent monetary policy to support or come to the rescue of its fiscal policy. Add to that the country’s limited fiscal space, and what this tiny tourism and real estate nation has is a unique vulnerability. And a major political challenge for Prime Minister Dusko Markovic. In a recent  , the International Monetary Fund stated that financial stress has materialised in 30% of the 59 low-income developing countries (LIDC), with 40% of LIDCs now facing significant debt-related challenges, up from 21% five years ago. As many as 33 LIDCs that collectively account for 7% of the world’s population and 0.7% of world GDP, are in “fragile situations” – weak institutional capacity, armed conflict, or both. Despite the shrill and angry political rhetoric, India has remained protected from these high tides of crises. Economic reforms have helped, of course – the shift to a more efficient goods and services tax (GST), the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, an inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, and more steps towards liberalisation of foreign direct investment (FDI), among others. Above all, the most invincible shield India has against a financial crisis is economic growth that has been rising consistently over the past four quarters and stands at  , a figure no analyst or institution, Indian or international, expected. This growth, and the resultant higher taxes, will more than make up for financial vulnerabilities. The 12% fall in the value of the rupee over the past 12 months is nowhere near a crisis. Despite an angry politics that’s getting angrier with every election, state or municipal – the democratic tax we pay to be free – the real danger in India is a race to the fiscal bottom. This is happening through the use of freebies, such as the new demand for pension for farmers by Anna Hazare, for instance, or farm loans during state elections. For a country that has a per capita income of less than $2,000, such demands and the accompanying political rhetoric burden the fiscal. In an election year, such demands will rise. Fortunately, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keeping these at bay, and using the extra funds carefully – the Rs 500,000 health cover for the poorest 100 million households for instance. Compared to the six examples above, India neither has a currency crisis, nor a debt crisis. What it does have is a growth advantage, a rising tax-GDP ratio lever, and a higher tax-paying population – all of which are virtuous economic indicators. The drop in savings rate, to 29.6% in FY2017 from 31.4% in FY2014, remains a cause for concern. Not only must the savings rate rise to support and catalyse future growth, it must turn into investment and not stagnate as physical assets. In a political year, the best we can expect is the maintenance of economic growth, a steady fiscal and low inflation rate; the new government will reprioritise its finances. But do remember, on the international financial high table, fund managers act as a herd. So, the noises of “emerging markets crisis” are really a signal for global investors to pack up and leave, or sell high and buy low. The market is flooded with talks of an “emerging markets contagion”. Such tendencies are good for speculators and short-term investors that make money through volatility. The Indian market has so far remained protected from the downside, with a rise of 20.1% over the past year, after Germany’s 32.4%, and the US’s 21.4%. Barring a slight overvaluation that may correct as the next quarter numbers deliver profits, there is little real risk to the India story. In fact, it only seems to be getting stronger. And if global funds are seeking a place to ride a large market in a trillion-dollar plus growing economy, which better place than India? For now, be comfortable in the knowledge that the Indian economy is stable and growing – but stay alert to speculative exits. Given the former, the latter are an opportunity to buy.

207,DailyO,"The Bay of Bengal for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is an inter-regional sub-grouping of South Asian and South East nations territorially linked to the Bay of Bengal, or having access rights to it as governed by the UN Law of Seas. It was founded in 1997 as BIMST-EC, established by the  . It comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand and Sri Lanka. Myanmar joined in 2002, and Nepal and Bhutan joined in 2004. Its Secretariat was established in Dhaka in 2014. Technically, Laos and Malaysia are also eligible to apply for membership. Geopolitics was the raison d’être for the birth of the BIMSTEC. This is because the Indian Ocean has become the strategic pivot where rivalry between China and India are paramount. As much as 60% or more of China’s oil sources traverse the Indian Ocean, and have to pass the Malacca Straight, which is under the control of the US Navy. China, thus, needs and finds alternate access points in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Maldives and Bangladesh. This displeases India, which considers South Asia as its exclusive sphere of influence. It’s believed that the Indian Ocean is the ""Chicken’s Neck"", so to speak, of China’s national security. India’s control over the Indian Ocean could critically threaten China’s energy security, with or without the US. India’s ""Look East"" policy is, therefore, primarily a counter to China’s ""String of Pearls"" strategy. With BIMSTEC, India hopes to get China to pull back in the Indian Ocean. India’s unprecedented recent investment in its Naval force is proof of this desire.    India’s 1993 “Look East” policy coincided with Thailand's 1996 ""Look West"" policy. Thailand targeted Myanmar, India and South Asia for its markets, in its desire to be an industrial state by the early 21st century. In tandem, it also sought to reduce the dominant hold of China in Myanmar, as well as to get it back in the international arena with the open support of the EU and the US.  We may recall that Myanmar — then Burma — had played a prominent role in international politics from its independence in 1948 till the early 1960s.The selection of U Thant as the UN Secretary General in 1961 is sound testimony to their successful role in international politics. It all changed with the military coup in 1962, led by General Ne Win and his vision of a one-party Buddhist socialist state that chose to remain a hermit-like country, isolated form international affairs and discouraging all foreign contacts by its citizens. Then, with the fall of the USSR, the military government changed the name of the country from Burma to Myanmar and introduced multi-party elections in 1990, where the National League of Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won a landslide victory. This was hugely supported by the EU and the US as a step towards Myanmar entering the liberal global world order, with the so called ""end of history"". Myanmar joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. Both India and Thailand seized the geopolitical and geoeconomic opportunities arising from this, as, in jointing the WTO, Myanmar sought to open up to trade and investment to the whole world and move away from the stranglehold of China.   In sum, the Myanmar factor is the most vital in Sino-Indian geopolitics, as this is where India meets China, and BIMSTEC is a sub-regional innovation to gain leverage over Myanmar. So central Myanmar is to India that it has acquiesced to dropping its own soft power diplomacy, relying on appeals to human rights and democracy, when dealing with Myanmar. As the name suggests, BIMSTEC is an inter-governmental organisation jointly led by the countries' ministries of foreign affairs. As per the 1998 ministerial meet, it sought cooperation in six priority sectors — namely trade, transportation and xommunication, energy, tourism, technology and fisheries. The ministerial meet in 2005 added six more sectors — agriculture, counter terrorism and tranasnational crime, environment and  national disasters, public health, poverty alleviation and people-to-people cooperation (P2P). Finally, at the 2008 ministerial meet, it added a 14th sector, namely climate change. 1. Members are at different development stages — two lqand-locked developing countries (LLDC), two least developed countries (LDC), two development countries and one middle-income country (MIC).   2. Less integrated than SAARC or Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) 3. Internal security and political problems in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Thailand retard progress, demonstrating a lack of political will. 4. BIMSTEC does not represent the same order of priority to all member nations. 5. Although centred on the Bay of Bengal, yet no sea connectivity so far. 6. Actual trade potential of BIMSTEC still not explored. Focused as it is on the Bay of Bengal, Nepal joined the BIMSTEC for the possible grand opportunity to exercise its sovereign rights to marine resources, and the possibility of sea transportation with its own flag carrier. BIMSTEC’s progress is abysmally poor. Beyond being an instrument of India’s ""Look East"" and now ""Act East"" policies, and Thailand’s ""Look West"" policy, there is no grand vision where all members feel comfortable with what is to be the mission of the Bay of Bengal sub-region, where the Indian subcontinent meets with the Indo-China peninsula with all the civilisational contacts of yore.  Nepal must prioritise on how BIMSTEC fosters its national interest, and how it can contribute to BIMSTEC. Nepal should make it clear that it seeks the identification of its maritime territory under the Law of Seas. What are its sovereign rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is a strategic concern in Nepal's national interest, and probably the main reason for it joining the BIMSTEC, in addition to influencing transit states like Bangladesh, India and Thailand to accede to the New York Convention on Land Locked States. For air connectivity, it should create air hubs centred on sub-regional airports as hub and spokes. Also, Nepal should not despair with no FTA. The BIMSTEC summit may be an opportunity to target a few industrial products for either value addition or supply chain formation, or both, either for exports or import substation. A preferential arrangement can be innovated to suit each project. Barter arrangements could be designed to help LLDCs with BOP problems.

208,Shiv Visvanathan,"The narrative about the Kerala floods splits into two dimensions. The first is a study of the nature of relief and response, celebrating resilience of the society. One finds in it the usual accolades about the Army and the voluntary groups. Kerala acknowledges all this but also paid a moving tribute to the 7,000 fishermen who aided the rescue operations. Their spontaneity and generosity was the stuff of legend. The media reporting on the event has been outstanding. Yet as the waters recede and the reality of reconstruction dawns, the nature of narrative changes. Now one has to produce a critique of policy and political economy and examine choices in the long run, the media becomes shortsighted. One needs a different form of discussions where neither quick solutions nor simple answers are available. A sociological intelligence is needed to weave the future tapestry of Kerala. This is essential for three reasons. Firstly, the moment the pressure of relief and rescue is over, the politics of the blame game can begin. But blame games beyond being factional and divisive are shortsighted. They do not proceed to the inner depths to look at the tectonic flaws in the system. Secondly, the act of reconstruction — while dutiful and well-intentioned — can replicate the evils of the past, creating a faster speed of imitation. Instead of rethinking the developmental model, reconstruction can recreate an uglier Kerala. We have to see the flood as a paradigm crisis and follow not the managerial experts but the ecological sage, Madhav Gadgil. Gadgil feels the logic of development in his veins. His father DR Gadgil was a member of the planning commission. Gadgil himself was a distinguished professor at the Indian Institute of Science. As a distinguished ecologist, he has taken major dissenting stands, including over Narmada and nuclear energy. One of the great legacies he has left behind is the Gadgil Report on the Western Ghats. The report that covered more than Kerala, suggested that the Ghats be considered and declared as ecologically fragile and sensitive area and even graded them in terms of ecological sensitivity. Unfortunately, a prophet is never recognised in his own domain until the crisis strikes. The Gadgil report was superseded by the Kasturi Rangan report which watered down the integrity of Gadgil’s recommendations. When the Kerala floods occurred, Gadgil reappeared as a prophet crying once again in the wilderness of the flood. But Gadgil was not hankering back to his report. Using it as a peg to emphasise that the floods were partly man-made, the question Gadgil raised was more general and futuristic. He was insisting science and politics to get together as a collaborative imagination and minimise suffering in the future. Suffering Gadgil suggests, comes when we do not examine the logic of choices and when the integrity of choices is corrupted by corporate interests. The contradiction was extreme, between a law-abiding society and a lawless mafia-like society which corroded the possibility of good governance. Gadgil’s words are only a proclamation, the beginning of an ecological manifesto. It is a suggestion that nature and diversity become central to our imaginations. Gadgil does not go so far but today we can suggest that nature be made a part of a constitutional imagination. Merely giving the Ganga some kind of cursory representation does not guarantee this. It makes the Ganga an expression of the PWD imagination. The river as an ecology and as a way of life deserves better. If Kerala gives its rivers a constitutional representation and finds the cosmological and legal backing for it, democracy advances in a new and different way. The mines, the forest, the river, the wetland and their stakeholders are allowed to fight for the integrity of ecology and the numerous little livelihoods that depend on them. An industry that's gives one a job abstracted from context behaves differently from nature, which offers livelihood based on ecology to people. Nature then creates three levels of economy. First, nature as a cosmos and a chain of being is represented constitutionally. As a result, nature is read holistically and not at the mercy of economism, which reduces it to natural resources and strip mines it. Such a transition of thought is not going to be easy. Just thinking about Kerala, it means one has to create a different Marxism because standard Marxism was based on the Judeo-Christian attitude to nature. It felt nature was made for man’s use and was resource based in intention. Our leading institutes of development must rethink their categories of economics and go beyond mechanistic ones. Sustainability would become more real than class. More by focusing on nature, one breaks what Ivan Illich called the current war of development against subsistence. Growth for growth’s sake becomes a taboo and unecological quarrying a crime, both against nature and humanity. Kerala almost secedes from the mindset of today’s crass commercialisation to recover its lost self. Second, one does not ignore the technological system but one realises its complexity and the incompleteness of all technological prediction. The claim to an infinitely accurate predictable weather system is sheer hubris. Complexity has shown that a lot of science is located within the structure of risk. They call not for technological prometheanism but technological modesty. A large dam, a hundred years ago in the age of Visvesveraya might have been an act of genius. Today a large dam or an obsession with dam systems is an act of illiteracy. It lacks a sense of ecolacy, the connectivity of knowledge and ethical action that ecology demands and democracy needs. There is another critical point that the Gadgil report made that is often sidelined. Gadgil insisted that people be consulted before decisions about their economic and ecological future are taken. In such a model empowerment is not only to the state as a stakeholder but to the citizen. This raises the question of responsibility of marginal, dissenting, ethnic groups and of civil society as a whole. One thinks of such rituals in a more differentiated sense of accounting, accountability, responsible citizenship. Accounting is honesty about a project, a transparency about money. Accountability demands that money also go to the right investments. Responsibility is a holistic sense of accountability and trusteeship, a language of caring for the marginal and the defeated which often get sidelined during debates on development. Kerala faces a paradigmatic challenge where cosmetic rebuilding will be an evasion of responsibility. Democracy as an imagination has to return along with rebuilding to create a new paradigm where rethinking a river revives a nation.

209,Kiran Tare,"The Pune City Police came under international scrutiny after they arrested five activists from different parts of the country for allegedly being Maoist supporters. The police’s credibility will be tested on September 6 when the Supreme Court decides whether their action was legitimate. The police have claimed that the arrested suspects — Varavara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, and Gautam Navlakha — were actively involved in a plot to overthrow the government. “The evidence conclusively points to their deliberate involvement and major role in a larger conspiracy hatched by banned CPI (Maoist),” according to a statement released by the police. The police also claimed that the CPI(M) was planning to buy weapons from Nepal and use them in India against politicians. Apparently, the deal needed Rao’s approval. The police said they were acting on intelligence inputs to establish how urban connections, coupled with a well-oiled support system, serve as an intellectual guide and work as a covert enabler for the outlawed left-wing extremists to carry out acts of calculated violence. They also claim to have evidence, involving the provision of arms as well as funds, responsibilities allocated in radicalising the youth, and students, and other paths leading back from the senior comrades of the Central Committee of the CPI (M). A police officer said that they will prepare a case, where the accused will be proclaimed as active members of the CPI (M). He pointed out that they call the party, PLGA (People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (India) and the India United Front as their “three magic weapons” to be used against the state. The supporters of the arrested activists, however, have stated that the government wants to muzzle the public dissent through their arrest. They have also opposed the application of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against them saying that these are reputed activists working for the downtrodden classes. “State and Police should immediately desist from using the draconian UAPA law against the human rights activists and public intellectuals,” stated a joint statement by 37 organisations who came in support of the arrested activists. These supporters have gone on to demand the immediate release of the activists, and a speedy investigation into the violence that erupted at Koregaon that erupted at Koregaon-Bhima on January 1. This case will also be a litmus test for chief minister Devendra Fadnavis as he is in charge of the state’s law and order. He is facing a situation where two different cases have been filed against two different ideologies. In the case of Elgar Parishad, the alleged Maoist front, all the suspects are from left-wing groups. On the other hand, the suspects in the Koregaon-Bhima violence case are all from right-wing groups. If his government can prove the Urban Maoists theory, he will conquer the hearts of traditional BJP voters. If he cannot, he will have to face their censure. The SC ruling on September 6 will be the first indication on whether he will succeed or fail.

210,Kamal Mitra Chenoy,"On January 1, 2018, a day after the Elgaar Parishad meeting in Pune, Dalits were targeted at Bhima Koregaon. Nearly eight months later, on August 28, five activists were arrested in connection with the case, in raids held across the country. The famous retired Supreme Court Justice, PB Sawant, one of the organisers of the Elgaar Parishad, has sharply criticised the arrests,   a “campaign of misinformation.” “These are really worrying developments. This is a campaign of misinformation. The (Pune) conference was an effort to bring together people under one slogan, ‘Save the Constitution, Save the Country’. By its action, the present regime has shown that it does not believe in the Constitution,” said Sawant. The January violence was witnessed during celebrations organised to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon, in which Mahar (lower caste) soldiers fighting for the British East India Company had defeated the upper caste Peshwa army. Just after the violence, it was reported that some upper caste activists reportedly linked to hardline Hindutva groups had been taken into custody by the police. Supporters of these activists, if not the activists themselves, were shown in the media. Later, these activists were released. In Pune, Joint Commissioner of Police Shivaji Bodkhe  were based on information received from five “urban Maoist operatives” arrested in a similar operation nearly three months ago. In June, six Dalit and left wing activists had been arrested. Have they been given access to legal help, medical help and family members, as is the requirement under law? What happened to the earlier set of detainees who were briefly detained on January 1? According to  t in  , another police officer, unidentified, has claimed there was “evidence in the form of electronic communications through a portal that ensured anonymity” against the activists. So, is an unidentified police officer getting evidence “in the form of (anonymous) electronic communications” the basis for the arrests? But the game had been afoot since early January. On January 4, two men, Akshay Bikkad and Anand Dhond, complained to the police against Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani and JNU student Umar Khalid, among the speakers at the Elgaar Parishad. Bikkad and Dhond alleged that Mevnani and Khalid created “communal disharmony” through their “provocative speeches” at the event.   This doesn’t seem to have worked as, though the FIR was registered, there has been no progress in the case. This may well have been because Umar Khalid was working on his PhD in Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, for most of the time in the past few years. On January 8, Tushar Damgude, a Pune resident, lodged a complaint with the police against six people, including members of the Kabir Kala Manch, for “creating communal disharmony through “provocative slogans, speeches, pamphlets, and booklet(s) at the Elgaar Parishad”. Considering that retired Supreme Court Justice PB Sawant was one of the organisers of the event, this seems highly unlikely. But, on the other hand, it has been pointed out that the “complaint”  motivated. It is this second FIR that has led the police to make August 28’s arrests. Those arrested on June 6 include Nagpur University professor Shoma Sen, Delhi-based activist of the Committee of Release of Political Prisoners, Sudhir Dhawale, a leader of the Mumbai-based Republican Panthers, Jati Antachi Chalwal, Nagpur lawyer Surendra Gadling of the Indian Association of People’s Lawyers, and Mahesh Raut, who had in the past been the Prime Minister’s Rural Development Fellow. They were charged with sourcing funds from banned Maoist groups to help in organising the Elgaar Parishad.  Those arrested on August 28 are: Varavara Rao, a poet and outspoken human rights activist; Sudha Bharadwaj, an advocate supporting peoples’ causes; Gautam Navlakha, a writer and activist; Vernon Gonsalves, a Mumbai-based activist; and Arun Ferreira, also a Mumbai activist. In addition, professor Anand Teltumde, of the Goa Institute of Management, had his house searched by the police. By August 29, the Delhi High Court had ordered that Gautam Navlakha be kept in house arrest and not taken to Maharashtra. The honourable judges were not convinced that the Pune police had enough evidence against him. Sudha Bharadwaj has been working among the poor in Chhattisgarh, and is Visiting Faculty, National Law School, Delhi. Varavara Rao is a veteran human rights activist settled in Hyderabad/Secunderabad. It is now necessary to examine the category “urban Maoist operatives.” My father was at one time the Senior Superintendent of Police in Andhra Pradesh, involved in “anti-Naxalite operations” from the end of 1960s for a decade, as the police forced the Maoists out of undivided Andhra. But neither then, nor till a few years ago, did I come across the “urban Maoist” category. Maoists get their name from Mao Ze Dong, who, in the initial years of the Chinese revolution, had to fight the Japanese and the Nationalist Chinese led by Chiang Kai Shek. The mainstream Maoists in Chhattisgarh still follow the old Maoist path. But “urban Maoists” so far, do not carry arms, something difficult to do in urban areas. Their ideology, as long as it is broadly Constitutional, is within the framework of the law. The Mumbai/Pune police, too, don’t always act as swiftly as they are doing now. The of rationalists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare, both allegedly killed by men with affiliations to hardline Hindutva organisations, are yet to be solved. As the Latin proverb goes, “suppressio veri, suggestio falsi,” that is: “suppress the truth, suggest falsehoods.” This double-dealing in civil society, along with certain elements in the police force and some authoritarian politicians, are the real “urban” and “rural” threats to our people and culture.",2018-08-29,"Urban naxals,Activists arrested,Maoism,Bhima Koregaon",What the arrests of activists linked to the Bhima Koregaon case tell us about the real threat to India,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-activists-arrested-urban-naxals-varavara-rao-sudha-bharadwaj-gautam-navlakha-vernon-gonsalves-arun-ferreira/story/1/26353.html
212,Manogya Loiwal,"From emergency meetings in the Trinamool Congress (TMC) offices to keeping mum on the syndicate expose on instructions from senior party leaders, the TV Today sting operation has emerged — an investigation that revealed the shocking connivance of the party and government officials with notorious syndicates — as not just another eye-opener, but has also left the Mamata Banerjee-led party searching for reasons to save loss of face. TMC leaders, some of whom are involved in the “syndicates” that keep a check on the supply of government contracts and construction related work, called for emergency meetings in the North 24 Parganas and Dum Dum area late at night, after the TV Today network exposed the presence of what PM Modi recently, during his visit to the state of West Bengal, called a “Syndicate Raj”. In the exposé, the TV Today network found that patronised by TMC councillors, members and government officials, these syndicates have spread their tentacles from real estate to Durga Pujas. These groups control sale of land, construction and building material — and if the buyer seeks legitimate means, the syndicates make sure he succumbs to their demands.    During the sting operation conducted by two India Today journalists over several days, a councillor, the husband of another councillor, a TMC member, an official and a syndicate operative were caught right on camera mentioning how the whole system works, and how ""protection money"" is extorted from businessmen. “If you protest, it will lead to a bigger problem and vandalism. They are very dangerous people. Their boss is a very big leader of West Bengal. He might become an MLA. He will have everything vandalised. Lockdown or shell out Rs 10 lakh,” Soumen Banerjee, husband of Bidhannagar TMC councillor Swati Banerjee, blatantly mentions to an India Today TV undercover reporter posing as a businessman. The pretext of the meeting, opening a ""restaurant""; the question, why police doesn’t intervene; and the answer, the ""muscle power"" these syndicates command. Banerjee was caught on camera along with a syndicate operative named Rana Basu demanding more than Rs four lakh from the reporter. “I told you that you have to pay up only once. He [Rana] will conduct Durga Puja in some other ward, not mine. Just see to it. That's it. Give him Rs 25,000 and close this discussion.” “It is all in the family,” the undercover reporter is told when he sought to speak directly to Swati Banerjee. Her husband is seen saying, “What will she do? You spoke to me. That's equally good.” These syndicates rely on simple coercive policies like “pay up or suffer the consequences” — a kind of unspoken law of the jungle in West Bengal. And the malaise is widespread. TMC worker Sushanto Das was caught on camera boasting how “the party is all ours. All leaders are with us”. A close aide of North Dum Dum’s TMC councillor Bidhan Biswas, a threatening Das says, “If someone buys land via others, we will cause ruckus.” Das, who openly admitted to being a TMC member, further boasted that, “[North Dum Dum] is our area. We manage everything — from the chairman, to the councillors to building plans. You don’t have to worry about anything,” when he was asked by one of the undercover reporters about the purchase of land, and whether it has to be done with his blessings. As can be seen in the sting, these syndicates don’t operate out of seedy underground dens. In fact, they do so brazenly and with official connivance. Party seniors have allegedly instructed those involved to lie low and stay away from the public glare, for the time being, at least. They have also been told to not speak about this, to the media or otherwise. Nirmal Ghosh, a TMC MLA from Panihati in North 24 Parganas district defended the party, saying: ""Our party chief has announced that nobody from the party should be involved with syndicate — be it local or central syndicate, we don't believe it and wherever there is a complaint we go through it and take necessary action."" Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vice president Chandra Kumar Bose, speaking to TV Today about the exposé, said: “Syndicates existed in Bengal earlier as well, but in the unorganised sector. Now, they are in the organised sector. I had given credit to Mamata Banerjee for being Chief Minister of a syndicate raj, not of West Bengal.” Bose added that not even TMC leaders are spared from the clutches of such syndicates. “My cousin Sugata Bose, who is a TMC MP from Jadavpur constituency, was attacked. My aunt Krishna Bose, who is 90 years old, was attacked. Her family was threatened and was told that they could not repair their house unless they bought building material from the syndicate. The TMC leaders are accepting [on camera] that there is syndicate raj,” said Bose. CPI leader Dinesh Varshney said that if a corporator can be seen asking people how much money they are willing to offer, it clearly shows that a system of coercion is in place. “Anything which is done by force had political patronage,” he added. Political analyst Somnath Singha Roy, however, dismissed the whole exposé and dubbed it as an attempt to “malign the TMC and put Mamata [Banerjee] down”, claiming that, the “people shown [in the India Today TV investigation] are not TMC leaders. Real estate brokers are everywhere in the world. What is new in this? What is the harm if some youths are supplying sand and bricks?” CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, on the other hand, questioned the willingness of the TMC to initiate any action against those caught on tape. He said, ""Syndicates have been a reality in Bengal. I congratulate TV Today for exposing this. However, I have serious doubts on the willingness of the TMC government in the state to take any action against those involved. These are traits of the TMC and the party lacks political will to take action against those involved."" The expose has left the entire TMC leadership red-faced. The sufferers, of course, are the people of West Bengal who intend to work for the development of the state in various sectors. So long as this Syndicate Raj is in place, development in the state will continue to hit the wall.

213,DailyBite,"Aside from a drizzle of rain in Delhi, Monday morning also brought a deluge by way of a backlash for AAP and its recently announced Lok Sabha candidate from the East Delhi constituency, Atishi Marlena. The reason being,   that AAP had apparently asked Atishi to drop her surname as it 'sounded Christian'.  As allegations flew thick and fast, several politicians jumped into the fray. Asaduddin Owaisi, AIMIM chief, tweeted that this it is the reality of India's electoral politics, that to get elected, one cannot have a name which is/might sound like a Christian/Muslim name. 
 
 AAP was quick to issue a clarification. Akshay Marathe, its joint secretary, bemoaned the fact that instead of focusing on issues like education or healthcare , the discourse was being shifted to identities of caste and religion, and Marlena, being a progressive politician, doesn't use her caste name 'Singh' to ask for votes. According to some reports, Atishi's parents, Dr Tripti Waha and Dr Vijay Singh, being committed Leftists, gave her a surname combining Marx and Lenin. “Ever since she was appointed prabhari, a rumour began to be spread by political parties in the constituency, especially the BJP, that the AAP had given ticket to a Christian,” a senior party leader told  .  Whatever may be the truth, it is indeed a welcome change. When the ruling party, the BJP, itself is saying before the Election Commission that putting a cap on poll funding of political parties will lead to caste politics, Atishi removing her surname is actually doing the opposite. It would encourage voters to either vote for or against her based on her views and vision, instead of what her religion or caste is. At the end of the day, it should also be her choice. While the sad truth is, caste and religion do affect polling, political parties and politicians, instead of dissing AAP, should ideally follow suit and stop distributing tickets based on such polarising criteria. We should do away with all the Gandhis, Scindias, Modis, Owaisis, Yadavs and Singhs from these names and go to the polls based on manifestos, report cards and vision instead.",2018-08-28,"BJP,Lok Sabha election 2019,AAP,Atishi marlena","Why just Atishi Marlena, all netas' surnames should be dropped",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/atishi-marlena-surname-aap-delhi-caste-electoral-politics-bjp/story/1/26313.html
214,Minhaz Merchant,"A nanny state is good for no one: citizens or government. It is good though for one group: regulators. India suffers from too many laws, too little enforcement. The Narendra Modi government has done well to   colonial-era laws. Hundreds more though remain on the statute books. Some of the worst like Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code should have been repealed years ago. They  the Supreme Court’s final verdict while a nervous government fiddles on the sidelines, hoping the apex court will deflect the political heat from the BJP’s right-wing vote bank where homophobia remains disgracefully strong. The government’s attempt meanwhile to regulate social media has been quickly aborted. Fake news that incites violence is a worldwide problem. The answer, however, is not to   but to improve enforcement of existing laws on cybercrime. All social media platforms have   to check abuse and incitement to violence. WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter can be expected to behave responsibly but Telegram and sites in the dark web are often beyond the pale. What can’t be controlled at source must be checked by fast, firm but fair policing. A blanket block of mobile apps that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) sought is not workable. As reported: “Telegram claims its cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force them to give up any data. ‘Thanks to this structure, we can ensure no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people’s privacy and freedom of expression,’ Telegram explained on its website.” It is through its proposed   though that the government has revealed a nanny approach. The draft e-commerce policy is currently open for public review. The centerpiece of the policy is a proposed cap on e-commerce discounts. Nothing could be more self-defeating and consumer-unfriendly. India’s e-commerce market is still small compared to America’s and China’s. Yet it has grown from $14 billion in 2014 to $50 billion in 2018 because the government kept its nose out of what is not its business. Without governmental interference, the India Brand Equity Foundation estimates that the country's e-commerce market will  . By putting a cap on e-commerce discounts, the government could put a cap on that unfettered growth. The idea clearly is to protect small kirana stores from price gouging. But as the experience of Walmart-Flipkart and Amazon India shows, kirana stores benefit by partnering with e-commerce sites which play the role of wholesalers, buying inventory and letting market forces operate.  Regulation in the public interest is important but not at the cost of public interest. Internet users in India are estimated to   (as of June 30, 2018) to 829 million in 2021. They can be an economic force multiplier across sectors – consumer and business. E-commerce is an enabler in this transformation. It has brought tier-2 and tier-3 towns with rudimentary retail infrastructure into the mainstream. A buyer in under-retailed Palitana in Saurashtra can in minutes, buy and have delivered in days to her doorstep,  a choice of home appliances and other products. E-commerce leaps over physical boundaries and infrastructure in small towns, providing choices and discounts. What could be more open, transparent – and democratic? Putting a cap on discounts will put a brake on e-commerce growth. It will not necessarily help kirana stores the government seeks to protect but it will inevitably hurt consumers and the broader economy by dampening demand. Over-regulation is the worst form of economics. It adds a layer of discretionary power to the nameless, faceless bureaucrats and impedes the growth of free markets. The nanny state makes a cameo appearance in other ways. Like a Shakespearean tragedy, former finance minister Pranab Mukherjee’s 2012   continues to haunt India. Many believe that this one piece of obtuse legislation has done more to discourage foreign direct investment (FDI) in India than any other single factor. The retrospective law should have been repealed in July 2014 when then finance minister Arun Jaitley presented his first interim Union Budget. Only lawyers have benefitted since 2012 from endless litigation by Vodafone, Cairn India and others. A nanny state which lacks self-confidence hides behind such self-destructive legislation. The Modi government has done some stellar things. Apart from its various welfare schemes (too many to mention but several of outstanding merit), the   (IBC) stands out as a game-changing reform. Here too though, the law intrudes. Over 500 cases relating to non-performing assets (NPAs) are before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) but only a handful have been resolved. Litigation continues to stall processes that the IBC had mandated must be completed in 270 days. Waking up to the possible misuse of India’s clogged courts to sabotage the IBC, the government is   special courts to deal with IBC cases. In other countries, commercial courts have long dealt with business disputes. The IBC is now likely to lead to what in effect will be a separate commercial court system that will relieve the pressure on our regular courts burdened by over three crore pending cases. After 71 years of socialism, bureaucracy and stifling controls, the government must stop hand-holding citizens. In a free society, the government empowers citizens by reducing the role of government so that it can concentrate on its real job: good governance.",2018-08-28,"Business,Arun Jaitley,Ibc,IPC","PM Modi's unfulfilled pledge: Maximum governance, minimum government",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-governance-regulations-ipc-ibc-arun-jaitley-business/story/1/26324.html
215,Makarand R Paranjape,"Hanoi, the capital of Socialist Republic of Vietnam, a country of some 95 million people, is the host of the  . I have just returned to the conference after a visit to the most important monument in the country, at the Ba Dinh Square, dedicated to President Ho Chi Minh. It was at this site that Minh, that President of the Communist Party of Vietnam (1951-69), read out the declaration of independence on September 2, 1945. The mausoleum, inspired by Lenin’s in Moscow, took nearly two years, from August 1973 to September 1975, to build. This massive and impressive grey granite building overlooks a big square, with extensive gardens. Hundreds of visitors line up, walking nearly half a kilometre in batches, conducted by female ushers in traditional costumes, to the central hall. There, in a glass case inside the cold solemn sanctum, lies the embalmed body of their leader, bathed in unearthly warm white light. Guards maintain discipline, forbidding any disrespectful behaviour including eating, drinking, smoking, taking photographs, wearing inappropriate dresses, even putting hands in pockets. Though adorned with military regalia and socialist memorabilia, this monument is nothing short of a sacred shrine. I have now completed visiting the holy trinity of embalmed Communist leaders, Lenin in the Red Square, Mao in the Tiananmen Square, and now Ho Chi Minh in the Ba Dinh square. I came back from the unforgettable experience, which also includes walking through Minh’s palace gardens and museum next door, drenched in the rain. As the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wikremesinghe, said in his keynote remarks on the first day of the conference, the Indian Ocean is “the ocean of the future”. That is because it houses the world’s two most populous countries, China and India, who are also economic powerhouses of the world. The Indian Ocean, in addition, is the waterway  , constituting half the world’s container traffic, 40 per cent of its oil supply and 60 per cent of its oil trade, pass. Freedom of navigation and protection against disruption are thus of great importance to all the countries of the Indian Ocean rim. It is, therefore, imperative for them to come up with a robust, rule-bound, and stable architecture of governance for the region to solve disputes and conflicts. India being way behind China on almost any given parameter of power, this conference is one way to create a counternarrative to our eastern giant neighbour’s ambitions. The latter, some would say, including flexing its might and muscle in “our” Indian ocean. But from the Indian perspective, the Indian Ocean belongs to all the countries of the region, big or small, in a rule-bound order of friendly cooperation and exchange. China, we might remember, has to mind the Pacific front too, not just the Indian Ocean. That is India’s advantage; our unique position bang in the middle of this vast water body gives us the influence and leverage to make a difference. While China is investing trillions of dollars in its Belt and Roads Initiative (BRI), India’s “Sagarmala” can afford us considerable traction for much less. World powers like the US and Japan, not to mention other regional players such as Australia and Iran, are also interested in counterbalancing China’s predominance. Even Russia, which so far does not have a major presence in the conference, is also keen to have its say in the Indo-Pacific region. In his keynote address at the Shangri La dialogue in Singapore in June earlier this year, PM Narendra Modi once again reiterated India’s push in the region based on samman (respect), samvad (dialogue), sahyog (cooperation), shanti (peace) and samridhi (prosperity). He called the Indian Ocean “key to India’s future”. In the inaugural session, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj reiterated India’s foreign policy priority in “nurturing a climate of peace and stability in this region”. She said, “Our vision for the region is one of cooperation and collective action.” The Indian Ocean series of conferences is the brainchild of BJP strategist, ideologue, and national general secretary Ram Madhav. He told me, “We try to bring ministers, senior bureaucrats, and policymakers on one common platform so that they can take concrete steps towards building a security and governance architecture for the Indian Ocean.” Retired Maj Gen Dhruv Katoch, now director, India Foundation, flagged terrorism as a growing “cause of concern”: in the November 26, 2008, attack on Mumbai, in which 164 people lost their lives, the terrorists “came by sea”. Stressing that the region needs reliable dispute resolution systems, Shakti Sinha, director, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, and one of the organisers, said: “While band-wagoning is useful and necessary,” smaller countries should also “avoid being used as pawns” by big powers. Vietnam, as the venue of the 3rd Indian Ocean Conference, is important since it has opposed imperialism for over a thousand years, not just Chinese rule in the distant past or domination in recent years, but also French colonialism and US occupation. Today Vietnam is taking an active role towards building maritime safety, security, and prosperity in the Indian Ocean region. What is key to the success of any such international initiative is cooperation based on mutual interest and respect for each member state. The Indian Ocean littoral nations vary vastly in size, population, military and economic might, but all of them have one overriding common cause: to keep the waters safe and open for trade, commerce, and movement.

216,Manoj Joshi,"A year after Doklam, India and China are doubling down on their old Confidence Building Measures and, according to  , they are planning to sign a new bilateral Memorandum of Understanding on defence exchanges and cooperation. These decisions have been taken during the visit of China’s defence minister Wei Fenghe to India last week. According to the report, the two sides also agreed to handle Doklam-like incidents with sensitivity and resolve them through greater interaction at lower levels in the military. This immediately begs two questions. First, how does one just create a general rule about the Doklam incident where India was able to intervene in what it considers Bhutanese territory, because of the proximity of the Chinese road building effort which was just about 100 metres from the Indian position in Doka La? The second is to speculate whether consultation and talks at lower levels could have persuaded the Chinese to turn back at the site of road construction last June. The Chinese must have known that India is sensitive about Jampheri ridge and had earlier tolerated Chinese patrols going there on foot via the road-head below Doka La. But road construction was another matter and would have presaged the occupation of a ridge line that would have given the Chinese observation over the entire Siliguri Corridor. One of the bigger questions, raised about the Doklam incident last year, was whether the Sino-Indian CBM process had run out of steam. Over the years the two countries had signed a number of measures, beginning with the Peace and Tranquility Agreement (BPTA) of 1993 and ending with the Border Defence and Cooperation Agreement (BDCA) of 2013. Yet, there had been incidents, such as the Chinese incursions in Depsang in 2013 and Chumur in 2014. There was talk after the BDCA, that the Chinese would now like to draft a Code of Conduct, but little came out of it and in the run-up to the Wuhan summit. Officials on both sides emphasised that there would be no more such agreements. However, that still left room for the effective implementation of the older measures, which is what is now being attempted. Recall, that after the Wuhan summit, the Indian side gave clear instructions to its personnel to observe the older CBMs strictly. The Chinese did not give any public instructions on this, but no doubt the PLA, too, was told to strictly abide by the rules. Though the idea of a hotline between Chinese and Indian commanders is currently stuck up on issues of protocol, it will be untangled one way or the other and will definitely play a role in reducing tensions. The Wuhan summit has helped unfreeze the ties between the two countries. That, indeed, was the goal of the summit. This has led to a number of meetings between India’s defence and external affairs ministers with their Chinese counterparts, as well as those between the NSA and his Chinese counterpart. The two countries were able to hold their second maritime affairs dialogue in Beijing in July 2018. The first had been held two years before, in February 2016. Visits of military delegations have also resumed. Recently, Lt Gen Liu Xiaowu, Deputy Commander of the Western Theater Command visited New Delhi and India’s Eastern Command headquartered in Kolkata. This was followed by the visit of India’s Eastern Army commander Lt Gen Abhay Krishna to China heading a four-member delegation in August. The challenge for India is to maintain a balance in the competitive and cooperative elements of our relationship with China. Unfortunately, India’s own performance in the economic and military fields has led to a widening gap between them, requiring New Delhi to reach out to external players like the US to maintain a balance of power. In recent months, India has also tamped down its criticism of the Belt and Road Initiative. In Wuhan, the two sides took the decision to work on a joint project in Afghanistan, which appears to ignore Islamabad’s concerns about Indian activities in Afghanistan. It could also form the model of three-country cooperation in the region. One example can be Nepal where both countries are committed to railway projects and could end up creating a system that links the Tibet Railway to the Indian system. Engaging China enables New Delhi to prevent or deflect zero-sum outcomes relating to Beijing in its immediate neighbourhood in South Asia and the IOR. China will, no doubt, continue its steady penetration of the region, but engagement can ensure that this process is not used to undermine India’s security interests.

217,Sharat Pradhan,"They may not acknowledge that deep within   lived a 'Nehru', but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership doesn't seem to have the slightest hesitation in milking the name of its departed leader — as long as it goes on to serve their limited electoral ambitions. Many years before he actually died, Vajpayee retired from active politics. Having slipped virtually into a state of coma, his life sadly remained confined to a hospital bed in his home, where he remained as oblivious to the world around him as the people, who once looked up to him with awe. With his demise came the end of an era, where democratic values prevailed over party politics, where ideological differences did not come in the way of interpersonal relationships, and where inclusiveness remained an essential part of the political ethos. It were these unique qualities in the 93-year-old veteran that made his stand on a higher pedestal, making him a true 'Bharat Ratna'. Despite having grown in the company of RSS ideologues, deep down within him nestled a Nehru. And that was what took him miles ahead of all others in his right wing 'Sangh Parivar', where even Nehru's name is a taboo. Those sitting at the top today may have inherited Vajpayee's political legacy, but surely they are still far from imbibing the Nehruvian values he cherished and practised. Yet they are not shy of drawing mileage out of his demise. Even those among the BJP leaders, who hardly cared to call on Vajpayee over the past decade during which he lay bedridden, seem to have suddenly sprung into action and were seen paying homage to him. The exercise commenced with the decision of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath to carry Vajpayee's ashes to different parts of the state. A high-profile   was planned for the ashes of the icon, whose 'heart was never in sync' with the much-hyped and controversial 'rath yatra' led by Lal Krishna Advani in support of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, way back in 1990. This was clearly an afterthought, since the formal immersion of the ashes had already been carried out in Haridwar. Apparently, Yogi Adityanath wanted to make his immersion ceremony a far bigger affair. A press release issued by his office said that   across Uttar Pradesh and immersed in every river in the districts. Sure enough, the task sounded incredible as the count of the immersions went up to 163. When a scribe sought a party spokesman's comment on the practicability of the exercise, pat came the reply, ""Obviously, there is some mistake in the official press release issued by the state information department; the ashes will be carried only to the 17 divisional headquarters and immersed in the key rivers in each of these places."" Thus the ritual began with a high-profile 'asthi-kalash yatra' along the main thoroughfares of Vajpayee's karmbhoomi, Lucknow, where the immersion was carried out in the Gomti river. Union home minister Rajnath Singh accompanied the 'yatra' with chief minister Yogi Adityanath, while thousands of people followed the long motorcade to pay homage to their beloved leader. As if that was not enough, Yogi Adityanath also got down to launching several development schemes named after Vajpayee. Moving of a condolence resolution by the Yogi cabinet was understandable, even though it was rather late in the day (four days after the demise). But for a government that had little to do with Vajpayee's ideals in 17 months of its existence, it was surely a surprise that a bagful of schemes were now being launched in his name. Questions were also being raised about how many times had the UP chief minister visited Vajpayee during his prolonged illness. How much he subscribed to Vajpayee's school of thought was also a million dollar question. Quite systematically now, the UP CM seemed to be going overboard. He has already announced several memorials for the former prime minister in different parts of the state. One of these was proposed in Vajpayee's native village Bateshwar in Mathura district, the DAV College at Kanpur, where he completed most part of his education, as well as his 'karmbhoomi', Lucknow, from where he was elected to the Lok Sabha five times. Another memorial is planned in Balrampur, from where he won his first Lok Sabha election in 1957. Senior party leaders like Lalji Tandon, who has been named as the , feel that a befitting tribute to Vajpayee would be to name a grand institution after him. ""I would urge the chief minister to name one of the new medical colleges that were coming up in UP after Atal ji,"" he said. Tandon, who was always seen as Vajpayee's closest lieutenant in Lucknow, was perhaps the only party veteran who made it a point to visit him regularly during his nearly decade long illness. While he strongly refutes the charge that the party was out to play politics in the name of the departed leader, fact remains that the manner in which a series of events related to Vajpayee are being planned, shows that the party has the 2019 elections on mind. Who does not know how Vajpayee was completely ignored in successive election campaigns of the BJP. But there was a sudden surge of emotion in the party rank and file to encash his political reputation. In a nation ridden with caste politics, the advent of Narendra Modi did seem to give the party a backward tilt, leaving its traditional following of upper caste Brahmins somewhat disillusioned. In any case, the Adityanath regime has somehow created an impression that Rajputs are enjoying an upper hand. The return of Vajpayee to the centre stage of the poll campaign could therefore act as the much desired shot in the arm at a time when Narendra Modi was desperate to get anywhere close to the astounding victory on 73 of UP's 80 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. The changing caste equations and political re-alignments that were in the pipeline could upset Modi's applecart to an extent that all hope could turn into despair. Perhaps, the party's decision to play up the Vajpayee card was a consequence of some kind of realisation that all was not as hunky dory as it had been in 2014.",2018-08-27,"Ram Temple,Jawarharlal Nehru,Yogi Adityanath,Atal Bihari Vajpayee",Why the Yogi Adityanath government is in an overdrive to claim Atal Bihari Vajpayee's legacy,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/atal-bihari-vajpayee-yogi-adityanath-jawarharlal-nehru-ram-temple-lk-advani-asthi-kalash-yatra/story/1/26293.html
218,C Uday Bhaskar,"John McCain, the well-known and widely respected US Republican senator, who died fighting cancer on August 25, will be remembered as a combative, complex, contradictory and courageous American sailor-turned-politician. Born into an illustrious naval family (both his father and grandfather were four star admirals, the only such instance in the US Navy), he was captured in the Vietnam War when his plane was shot down in  . The young McCain defied all odds as a prisoner of war who was subjected to extreme torture and survived in an extraordinary saga of indomitable will and superhuman endurance. Seeking early retirement from the navy, McCain entered US politics in 1982 when he was elected to the US House of Representatives and later to the US Senate in 1986, where he became a strong and credible voice on matters of national security and foreign policy. The senator from Arizona was a tenacious legislator who had his own scrape with ethical misconduct in politics and after being exonerated, became a zealous advocate of probity in public life. John McCain was a serious Republican contender for the high office and had a shot at the White House, when he lost to Barack Obama in the 2008 elections. But, to his credit, he never lowered the bar of personal invective and attack — which has reached a coarse and vulgar new low in US politics in the last few years. The Donald Trump diatribe against Ms Hilary Clinton and the   during the 2016 campaign are cases in point. In a memorable quote attributed to John McCain, at one of the election rallies that pitted the Republican senator from Arizona against the Democrat senator from Illinois, a woman voter asserted that she could not trust Barack Obama because “he’s an Arab”. The McCain response that is now recalled with nostalgia was: “No, ma’am. He’s a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.” Regrettably, the McCain-Trump relationship was reduced to a deplorable level of personal insult — at one point, the latter even cast aspersions on senator McCain’s war record. In one statement, Mr Trump  : “He’s not a war hero... He’s called a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.” The no-holds-barred political diatribe in US politics during electioneering has an interesting South Asian link in relation to John McCain and the 1999 campaign for the Republican nomination for the White House. George Bush and John McCain were pitted against each other. The Arizona senator and his wife had earlier adopted a young Bangladeshi girl from a Mother Teresa shelter — this was portrayed by the Bush team as a case of McCain having secretly fathered a . The negative impact of this malicious slander had its intended effect. George Bush won the Republican nomination and the race to the White House in 2000 after the second Clinton tenure. Senator McCain’s contribution to the US political discourse and legislative process is immense and was also critical in certain cases — as, for instance, in his casting the swing  that prevented the repeal of Obama’s Affordable Care Act. This was interpreted as a case of McCain turning the tables on Donald Trump and denying him the pleasure of overturning yet another Obama initiative, but McCain defended his action as being in the larger interest and welfare of the American people. John McCain was a staunch advocate of greater US-India engagement. I had occasion to meet the senator at a couple of conferences where the subject was deliberated upon. Gracious to a fault, he acknowledged the bond between veterans and was candid in his assessment of the potential and the pitfalls in the bilateral relationship that was slowly moving from deep estrangement to one of cautious engagement. In June 2016, senator McCain  : “As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am confronted every day with the security concerns and threats to our own nation's safety, as well as threats to the rest of the world. And in a time when threats seem to be only increasing and chaos increasingly fomented, I see in India a country that can and should fight with us to maintain global security. In the coming years, I see an India that provides critical stability in a rapidly changing Indian Ocean region. I see an India that maintains regional balance against expansionist adversaries in the Pacific. And I see an India that is a stronger, more capable ally in the struggle against global terrorism and piracy. And this is just the beginning. If we can come together as defence partners, our countries can be immensely positive forces for increased global peace and security.” He also noted the constraints and, in his candid manner, his advice to both countries merits extensive recall. To the US side, he noted: “Getting there, however, will not be easy. To achieve all this, the United States will need to begin treating India the same as it does its close partners and allies. Asking India to increasingly take on global responsibilities, yet not providing the associated benefits, is not a sustainable strategy. Whether it is streamlining the approval process for defence exports, jointly developing military technology or coordinating defence activities, the United States needs to make a clear, unambiguous commitment to our joint future in defence.” The message to Delhi was equally unambiguous. “India must begin acting like a close partner and ally. Despite the growing closeness, it is no secret that frustration continues to exist in many areas, both defence and non-defence. Whether these frustrations are justified or not, they represent a hindrance to progress. The United States expects a lot of its partners and allies, including joint patrolling, significant contributions to armed conflicts, and a strict adherence to human rights, among other things. The sooner India can showcase these commitments, and wipe away the lingering frustrations, the further it will move toward achieving the global power status it seeks.”  In an unintended manner, this sets the agenda for the forthcoming 2+2 talks that will be held in Delhi in early September. The McCain template for US national security will have an abiding relevance — this may well be the most befitting legacy of a US military hero and diligent legislator, who, till the very end, served his country with conviction and courage.",2018-08-27,"India-us relations,2+2 dialogue,Narendra Modi,John McCain",How John McCain set the agenda for the 2+2 talks between India and the US,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/john-mccain-india-narendra-modi-india-us-relations-2-plus-2-talks/story/1/26295.html
219,Rahul Noronha,"In western Madhya Pradesh, a group of tribal youth organised under the banner of Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti (JAYS) is forcing the BJP and Congress to rework their strategy ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections. Set up by Dr Hira Alawa, a doctor who was till recently working at AIIMS, New Delhi, JAYS has been demanding an honest implementation of the Panchayats Extension in Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act in tribal districts in the state and has decided to now contest elections to ensure that their demand is met. Concerned over the large presence in rallies organised by JAYS, the BJP has reached out to it, with CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan holding a meeting with its leadership. The meeting seems to have been inconclusive with the political demands of the group unmet. The BJP has, however, decided to attempt blunting the edge of JAYS by announcing the setting up of a Janjati Adhikar Sabha in villages lying within the 89 tribal blocks of the state. Madhya Pradesh has not yet made rules under the PESA Act for its implementation. The Adhikar Sabha is expected to be a halfway house that meets the demands of various tribal groups on this count. The Congress leadership, on the other hand, is also in talks with JAYS leaders who want to enter into an alliance with it. The Congress leadership is not sure about the strength of the JAYS to give into its demands of seats and is presently examining them. A group of voluntary organisations sympathetic to the Congress is also helping out in this context. JAYS shot to popularity by questioning what mainstream parties like BJP and Congress have done for tribals. It holds both parties responsible for not empowering tribals. It is questioning the dilution of tribal culture both by the RSS and the Church in western MP. It claims that it compelled the MP government to declare a holiday on UN Day for Indigenous People on August 9. JAYS organised a large public meeting in Dhar recently that compelled political parties to take note of their activities afresh. It has been maintaining that it will put up candidates in all 47 ST reserved assembly seats in MP and in another 80 seats where tribal vote matters. Presently, the BJP controls 31 out of the 47 seats, while the Congress has 15 and independent represents one seat. The group had put up its candidates in student council elections held in colleges earlier this year in which it put up an impressive show in Dhar, Barwani and Jhabua districts.

220,Amit Sengupta,"Their villages are called ""cheetmahals"". The palace of the ""cheets"". In colloquial ""Rajbangshi Bengali"", they are simply called ""cheet"". The word can only be explained through a metaphor: if you splash blue ink from a fountain pen on a white canvas, the dots are called ""cheet"". That is, they are simply ""cheets"" – dots on the map. Indeed, till July 31, 2015, they did not even exist in the map. Not even perhaps on Google Earth. Across the stretched out barbed wires in the lush green India-Bangladesh border in North Bengal, with ""dhan"" and jute fields spread across like an infinite bedspread, in the vicinity of the erstwhile flourishing kingdom of Cooch Behar, which did not succumb to the British, between several outposts of the Border Security Force (BSF), the ""cheets"", or enclaves, have existed since 1947, since the Partition of India and the creation of East and West Pakistan. Indeed, they have existed here since 1949, because the Cooch Behar kingdom joined India two years later. All their land documents, until now, are derived from the revenue records of the Cooch Behar kingdom, including across the border, with Rangpur and Lalmonirhat in Bangladesh in the neighbourhood. There are stories that the kings of Rangpur and Cooch Behar would hunt and play dice and trade the villages they gambled. Or that they made a treaty for a trade passage, in a porous border, in the hunting fields of the forest, and then shared a meal — hence the famous name of the current tourist spot: Raja Bhaat Khawa (the raja eats rice). There were 51 Bangladeshi enclaves in India and 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh across both the countries in the border. These are enclaves surrounded by villages of both the countries. For instance, if villagers wanted to move from one enclave to another, they might have to cross ""foreign"" territory. Before 1947, there was no problem. After 1947, ancient habits have failed to die. After the treaty of July 31, 2015, the Indian enclaves were included in Bangladesh, and the 51 Bangladeshi enclaves joined India. The Indian tricolour was unfurled after the treaty. People now have photo identity cards, but they are not sure if the cards are officially valid. They have electricity and voting rights. And, yet, they still seem to be terribly left out of most scheme of things. “We are not outsiders. We are Indians,” said Sadhu in one enclave. “So why are we treated as outsiders?” One of them was deported to Bangladesh from Delhi because the Delhi Police declared his photo identity card and Aadhaar card as illegitimate. A certain collective fear psychosis stalks the enclaves. Before 2015, the people of these enclaves lived in a twilight zone, with no voting rights, no citizenship or political and social identity, no school or health centre, no market or transport, outside all zones of governance or administration, beyond all public and private space, outside the Indian Constitution, bereft of all social benefits and fundamental rights — not even a geographical dot on the map of India and Bangladesh. Since 1947, they had no police to monitor them, no law and order machinery, no gram panchayat or community leader, no electricity or water connection, no land rights, not one document to prove if they are Indian or Bangladeshi. If they would go to the ""Indian"" market, they would be called ""Bangladeshi"" and abused. If they rushed to Bangladesh, in case of medical emergency, they would be packed off to jail for endless periods. Most of them have lived with multiple identities in India. Almost all the children have ""two fathers"" — one, the real father in the enclave with no documentary evidence to prove his existence, the other, a distant friend or relative, whose name is listed as father to take admission in schools and colleges, or to get admitted in a hospital. If a crime would happen, there would be no police. Women were left to their fate, if assaulted. There are villages with vast expanses of empty land. One particular village with vast expanse of empty space became a dumping ground for dead bodies and raped women. The police would not enter the village so the criminals had a free run. Despite the heat, even now, nobody sleeps in the open. Their land has been taken over by the state, so they are virtually landless in their ""new country"". Their land records anyway are derived from the revenue records of the Cooch Behar king. They call themselves ""Rajbongshis"" — the subjects of the king. Most Bengalis are scheduled caste, the Muslims are listed as OBC. Most of them have no certificate to prove their caste identity. Significantly, they live in absolute harmony, and barring odd incidents, allegedly engineered post-2014 by Hindutva forces, there has been no history of communal violence since 1947. Despite no rights, the education standards are high. Almost all enclaves have graduates and post-graduates, though they could not get government jobs since they had no document to prove that they were Indians. Children go to school, even of those families who are abjectly poor, that is, when they are not helping their entire family, mother, father and brother, to work for 16 hours at the brick kilns, as in Falnapur and Nolgram, in Mathabhanga subdivision of Cooch Behar district. “Earlier there was total darkness. We used to study with a lantern. Now we have electricity. So it is nice,” says little Brishti, in the Falnapur enclave. Those who have returned from the Indian enclaves in Bangladesh, live in small tin sheds in three camps in North Bengal: Dinhata, Haldibari and Mekhliganj. They have left all they had in Bangladesh, including land. “The Indian government promised us land, home, compensation, jobs: after three years we are still waiting,” said Kachua Burman at the Dinhata camp. Most of them work as landless agricultural labourers for three months; rest of the year they are jobless or do odd jobs. Life is hard. Said MD Usmangani, an ayurvedic doctor (without a degree): “It was the longing for my country that compelled me to leave my land and village, to come to India. I am an Indian, and, yet, I feel that I am a second-class citizen. For instance, we don’t even have access to primary health care.” For most, Hindus and Muslims, the border, or the new map does not really exist. Marriages and festivals, as much as trade, are still on, despite the BSF this side and the Bangladesh Border Guards (BDG) on the other side of the barbed wires. There are Indian villages beyond the barbed wires, touching the zero point border line of Bangladesh. There are vast expanses of Indian agricultural land beyond the border fence. Villagers have to take permission from the BSF every time they go in (between 8am and 9am) and come out (4pm to 5pm) to till their land. Almost every villager complained of harassment and abuse at the hands of the BSF. “We are helpless. They treat us like dogs,” said a villager. Another said, “If a woman has labour pain, or if a snake bites us, we can’t get out of the BSF post except in the morning and evening. The gates will only open at the scheduled time. In between, if we die, so be it.” In the border, surely, the BSF calls the shots. Even the local administration has no control over them. The flip side is that there has always been love and bonhomie between the stateless enclaves and the surrounding villages in India. People get their children married across the border, there are relatives and families across the fence, and festivals are shared. Despite the BSF outposts, and the endless barbed wires, there is routine cross-border movement, including, smuggling — of cows, drugs, cough syrups, food stuff, pouches of sunsilk shampoo etc. Marjina Biwi and Anjali Burman are friends. They are Indians who were born in Indian villages. And, yet, they got married to men a decade ago in the stateless enclaves. From light to darkness, from identity to a life without identity.

They laughed and said: “Why not?”",2018-08-24,"Bangladesh,Bengalis,Cooch Behar,NRC","NRC and spillover politics: For Bengalis in Cooch Behar enclaves, home is where the hurt is",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/cooch-behar-enclaves-bengalis-bangladesh/story/1/26258.html
221,Rahul Noronha,"While a number of civil servants have joined politics in India, they usually make the shift post superannuation. So why is the current Raipur collector, the 2005-batch IAS officer Om Prakash Choudhary, reportedly joining politics when he has a promising career of 23 years ahead of him? Apparently, it is the BJP’s desire to put up a strong candidate at Kharsia — one of the 90 Assembly segments in Chhattisgarh to go to polls in November — that has led the party to pursue Choudhary for the role. On August 25,  that Choudhary has resigned from service. Why is the BJP so focused on Kharsia, a region in the Raigarh district of the state? The Assembly segment of Kharsia was created after delimitation in 1977, and has remained a Congress bastion ever since. The Congress has never lost Kharsia — not even in the Janata Party wave of 1977 or the BJP wave of 1990, when Sunderlal Patwa swept to power in united Madhya Pradesh. The BJP, or its earlier avatar, the Jan Sangh, has tried every trick in the book to win Kharsia — from poaching successful Congress candidates to fielding heavyweights, such as late Dilip Singh Judeo in 1988 during a famous by-election, when then-CM Arjun Singh was seeking an entry to the House via Kharsia. In 1977, 1980 and 1985, Kharsia was represented by Laxmi Prasad Patel. LP Patel vacated his seat for Arjun Singh in the by-elections. Singh had a tough time, but finally, people gave their vote to the Congress. In 1990, Arjun Singh helped Nand Kumar Patel get the Congress ticket. Patel won the seat in 1990, in 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2008, and was the sitting MLA when he, along with his son, was killed by Maoists in the infamous  , in which almost the entire state leadership of the Congress was wiped out. The BJP even made LP Patel contest against Nandkumar Patel after the former was replaced by the Congress as its candidate. LP Patel, however, lost to Nandkumar. In 2013, Nandkumar Patel’s son Umesh was the Congress nominee and won by a handsome margin. OP Choudhary hails from village Bayang, which lies within the Kharsia Assembly segment. He hails from the Aghariya community, which is politically dominant in the region. Choudhary has an NGO in the name of his sister, who passed away after an ailment. The NGO is quite active in the region, and is connected to many people. Choudhary is said to be first person from Chhattisgarh to be selected in the IAS after the state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 2000. Since then, Choudhary has been focusing on education, and as Collector of the Maoist-affected district of Dantewada, established the Dantewada Education City there. He even received the   for the initiative in 2013.   In Raipur too, Choudhary has established Nalanda, a 24x7 community learning centre. He has a large public connect and is very active on Twitter, often informing his followers about what he has been up to. Stories about Choudhary’s struggles are in the public domain, and are often spoken of. His father had passed away when OP was very young.

222,Bajinder Pal Singh,"At an Indo-Pak conference held in Patiala in 2004, veteran  narrated a story about the Emergency and a dargah (mausoleum) from his hometown of Sialkot (now in Pakistan). 
 
 Nayar had been arrested during the  , and during his incarceration, he was allowed an occasional visit from his family members. On one such occasion, when his mother came to meet him for the ""mulakat"", she narrated a prophesy: “Coming Thursday, you will be released.” The end of Emergency was nowhere in sight, and at that time, few had an inkling that the draconian measures of the Emergency would be rescinded. Although he was behind bars, Kuldip Nayar was aware of the developments, and the prospect of an early release seemed remote. His mother, however, remained unfazed, as she told a story about a 'Pir' (spiritual guide) from Sialkot. ""Last night, Pir ji from Sialkot spoke to me in my dream,"" she said. ""Pir ji told me that you will be released this coming Thursday,"" she added. Nayar listened carefully, and did not respond. He was 24 when Partition took place, and he had vivid memories of Sialkot and the dargah. As foretold, the coming Thursday, his release orders were issued. Although Nayar could not be released that day since the orders arrived late in the day, he was finally set free from prison the next day. Following his release, Nayar was asked by his mother to offer a 'chadar' at the dargah of the Pir in Sialkot. It took him many months, but Nayar lived up to his promise and made an offering at Sialkot. The anecdote reflected two pivotal aspects of Nayar’s persona — his steadfast commitment to freedom of speech (he went to prison for this), and his unwavering support to India-Pakistan peace efforts. His arrest was reportedly precipitated by his activism at the Delhi Press Club when he led a signature campaign against the Emergency. Nayar’s stint in Tihar jail and his subsequent writings about Emergency cemented his stature as a steadfast proponent of press freedom as well as civil liberties. A decade later, he rallied again when Indira’s son Rajiv Gandhi brought the  . If the earlier generation knew him for his dedication to civil liberties, the next generation knew him as a peacenik. An unwavering champion of India-Pakistan peace, Kuldip Nayar continued his activism even during challenging times with the Wagah-Attari candle light marches being the obvious manifestation of his advocacy. During subsequent conversations with the author, he even envisioned a news agency for people in South Asia. “Why should Indians hear about events in Pakistan from western news agencies?” he had asked. ""We should create a news service that serves South Asia"", he had reasoned, and suggested a name for the wire service — South Asia News Service (SANS).

223,Sanjukta Basu,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s speeches and public appearances often make headlines for the wrong reasons, even when he does not deserve the flak. On August 22, Gandhi   at the Kampnagel Theater, Bucerius Summer School, in Hamburg, Germany, where he spoke about a plethora of issues, and answered questions from the audience, with his unique insight and perspectives. The Congress president spoke about the message of non-violence and forgiveness, about the power of listening to people, Indian men’s attitude towards women, the race with China that doesn’t exist for him, US-Indo-China ties, a vision for Western Europe, and Iraq’s tribal dynamics and the creation of ISIS. However, out of all the things he spoke, sections of the Indian media chose to pick up: “Rahul Gandhi said he wanted to give a message of nonviolence to PM Modi, but PM Modi didn’t like it.” The issues addressed by Gandhi encapsulated the social and political struggles India is facing today, and he spoke like a true leader on each topic. Here are some of the important points made by him at the event: Gandhi spoke of the vision India had had at the time of Independence and how it had been damaged by the Narendra Modi government in the past four years. “Seven decades ago, when India got independence, a nation that was isolated and had had no growth for a long time began a process of transformation. The transformation was essentially about Indian people breaking away from various social barriers such as caste, creed and religion, and gain upward mobility. It was not an easy transition — millions of people took risk in the process as the ways of their lives changed rapidly,” Gandhi said. “One of the fundamental components of this great transition was that everybody should be included in it. India shouldn’t transform for just one community — universal adult franchise was at the core of this idea. We are a nation of many languages, cultures and communities, and everybody had to be included in the transformation. The other component was that since the transformation would mean different levels of risk for different groups — Dalits, women, tribal, minorities — the government should support them in going through the transformation smoothly by providing a cushion to them.” The Congress president said these two ideas of India’s great transformation had been held up by successive governments since independence, but the present government had attacked these very ideas. “There is a narrative in India now that all groups and communities shouldn’t have access to this transformation. They (the BJP government) feel that tribal communities, poor farmers, lower caste people, minorities shouldn't get the same benefits as the elite,” Gandhi said. He added that the Modi government had started attacking the support system for the weak and vulnerable communities, by diluting laws and weakening schemes and provisions, such as the Right to Information Act, food securities Act, the MGNREGA, etc. “An even bigger damage done by the Modi government to India’s transformation is by hurting those very groups of people who took the biggest risks during the process. India could grow rapidly because of the informal economy — millions of people migrating from rural to urban areas acted as shock absorbers to the nation’s growth and development. But the demonetisation announced by Modi in November 2016 destroyed the cash flow to the informal sector and millions were left unemployed. Further, a badly conceptualised GST resulted in closure of thousands of small businesses,” he said. “And today, when you hear of the attacks on minorities or of the growing violence in India, these are the reasons behind it. A huge power transformation, which is shaping the entire world, requires certain protection for its people, and that protection is being taken away by the present government, and that’s what India is reacting to.” “In the 21st century, when the world is connected, it is very dangerous to exclude people. When the US attacked Iraq in 2003, they introduced a law that didn’t allow one particular tribe from getting public jobs ( ). At that time, it seemed like an innocuous decision. It was easy for the US to take down Saddam Hussein within a few months without much casualty. But, a few months later, the network that was excluded from jobs in Iraq, the Tikriti tribal network, linked up with a cell phone network and the network of artilleries left in villages, and what you got was an insurgency that fought the US and caused massive casualty. It didn’t stop there, but slowly entered empty spaces, in Iraq, in Syria, and connected with the global internet to form the horrific idea — ISIS,” Gandhi said.    “If you don’t embrace people, if you don’t give them a vision, somebody else will, and that may not be a great vision. That is the risk of excluding people from our development processes,” he said.   “Years ago, I had a conversation with the former US Defence Secretary, Robert McNamara, on his experiences of the Vietnam War and his big takeaways. He told me, ‘You know, Rahul, during the war, we would spend a lot of time talking to Vietnamese Generals. But we never listened. It was only after the war, when I met the same Generals, that I realised that what they were telling us was not what we were hearing and vice versa. If we had listened, we could have saved lives.’” “In the 21st century, you have to listen to everybody. You can disagree, but you have to listen to what they are saying, where they are coming from. Hate is a choice, and hate is a dangerous thing in a connected world. In the Congress party, we bring people together, we carry as many people as possible with us in the transformation process. There is a lot of hatred in the world today, but not enough act of listening. Listening is very powerful, and it can change the world.” Gandhi said non-violence was a foundational philosophy of our nation, and the essence of being Indian. “If someone hates you, that’s their choice, but responding to their hate with hate is foolish, as it will not solve any problem. The only thing that is in your control is your reaction to hate. So when the prime minister was making hateful remarks about me, I was feeling that I needed to hug him and tell him that the world was not such a bad place,” Gandhi said. “The only way you can fight violence is through non-violence, there is no other way. You may think you are very powerful and you can fight it, but it will come back. Violence is caused because of some anger, that anger has to be removed. I lost two members of my family, but when I looked at violence in the eye, I realised that the only way to move forward was through forgiveness. A lot of people think non-violence is a weakness, but it is, in fact, a strength.” “The question inherently implies as if both of us are racing towards one thing, but that’s not how I see it. India and China have different visions. China maybe growing at 11 per cent, but then I will ask how many people in China have freedom of speech? Each country has its own vision for growth. Reductive statements like ‘who is wining, who is losing’ is 20  century stuff. In the 21st century, we are both winning, I am wining here, you are winning there.” “I disagree with the idea that India is the most unsafe place for women, but treatment of women in India still leaves a lot to be desired. There is a lot of violence against women in India, some on the streets, some inside the home. It all boils down to the attitude of Indian men towards Indian women, and it requires a huge amount of work to change the culture. The level of violence in general is increasing in India and whenever that happens, the weakest sections suffer the most, so women today are facing that violence.” “In terms of policy, we have to include more women in the political system. We need more women in political parties, in the Parliament and the state legislatures. The Congress party is very conscious of including women at all levels — we are presently championing the demand for 33 per cent reservation for women in the Parliament. You simply cannot build a successful country if you don’t include women. So when they ask me are you winning the race, that is a race I would like to win.” “I don’t view population as a problem, but as productive people. I don’t have a problem with the number as long as they are educated and connected to the workforce. I don’t subscribe to the ideas of harsh population control measures adopted by China. We have to produce jobs. China produces 50,000 jobs per 24 hours, whereas India produces 450. The way forward is to strengthen the small and medium businesses, and in that we can learn from Germany.”",2018-08-23,"Demonetisation,ISIS,Germany,Rahul Gandhi","Why he hugged PM Modi, to the dangers of exclusion: What Rahul Gandhi said in Germany",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rahul-gandhi-germany-hamburg-isis-demonetisation-congress-narendra-modi/story/1/26223.html
224,Ambreen Agha,"Even as the brouhaha over the Saudi-Canada diplomatic spat plays out, Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor is vigorously pursuing the  for 29-year-old human rights activist Israa al-Ghomgham, along with four others. This unprecedented development, which may lead Israa to become the first woman activist to be beheaded, has enraged international human rights organisations, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. 
 
 Israa is charged with a non-violent crime — of protesting against the government and engaging in political activism by rendering “moral support to rioters.” As all five are under trial in a  for peaceful activism, rights groups have organised protests across the world, including outside the Saudi Embassy in London, and called upon the international community to pressure Saudi Arabia to not only call off their execution, but also put an end to death penalty. The charges appear to be politically motivated and unfair. Putting these young activists under the counter-terrorism court is an act of sheer folly, which not only endangers the life of dissenting voices in the country, but also raises questions about the credibility of institutions such as “counter-terrorism” courts, along with delegitimising the debate on “national security”. These recent developments come in the backdrop of the Saudi-Canada row over the arbitrary arrest of two women human rights activists, Nassima al-Sadah and Samar Badawi, in August this year. Significantly, on August 2, in a feminist foreign policy posture, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland in a tweet called for the release of the activists. Samar is the sister of Raif Badawi, another human rights activist and blogger who was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 2012, received 1,000 lashes in 2015, and was slapped with a monetary penalty of USD 266,000 for “violating Islamic values and propagating liberal thought.” 
 
 He was arrested for being critical of the Saudi government’s illiberal practices, as his criticism was seen as a breach of “Islamic values”. This kind of synonymy, where criticism of the government is tantamount to denigration of the religion, is dangerous statecraft. Following Freeland’s tweet, the Canadian Foreign Affairs Department sent another tweet, urging Saudi Arabia to “immediately release” the two women, as well as the other activists who have been incarcerated on similar charges.  
 
 This sent ripples into the Kingdom, and it  . In an act profoundly inimical to diplomacy, it recalled its Ambassador to Canada, and at the same time restricted the Canadian envoy from returning. Alleging “interference in domestic affairs” and calling the tweet from the Embassy a “break with diplomatic norms and protocol”, the Kingdom imposed a ban on new trade between the two countries and suspended direct Saudi flights to Canada. As diplomatic ties between the two countries face a serious setback, it is important to note that the recent concern expressed by the Canadian government on human rights issues in the Kingdom has a precedent. In fact, the Trudeau government, soon after assuming power, pressurised the Saudis to release Raif Badawi in private meetings between then Foreign Affairs Minister Stéphane Dion and his Saudi counterpart Adel Al-Jubeir. One such meeting was held on December 17, 2015, when Dion pursued the Saudis to grant clemency to Badawi, and discussed at length the state of human rights in the Kingdom. While the 2015 meeting was held backdoors, the 2018 criticism on social media is being seen as public shaming of the Kingdom, which led to the diplomatic fiasco. However, Freeland’s decision to bring the issue in the public domain appears to be a result of diplomatic frustration over the failure of three years of backchannel diplomacy to secure freedom for Raif Badawi. Moreover, the Saudis continued with the practice of silencing liberal-dissenting voices within, resulting in the most recent arrest of Samar and al-Saddah. Furthermore, a contextualisation of the recent developments in the larger debate on women’s rights makes it clear that the facade of “reform” — which the Kingdom has been propagating under the leadership of Mohammad bin Salman — is falling apart. Ripping through this smokescreen of “reform” propaganda, Freeland’s critique of the oppressive measures undertaken by the Saudi leadership is both timely and much needed for any kind of genuine reform — from within — to take place. Previously, in May this year, 10 women rights activists were labelled “traitors” and arrested for “undermining” Saudi Arabia’s “national security” and “destroying social cohesion.” While diplomacy will take its own course to restore ties between the two countries and revive the robust two-way trade as well as the multibillion-dollar military ties, what is of concern is the subject of women’s rights in an aggressively repressive “national security” discourse, which finds dissenting female voices more threatening than the misadventures in regional wars — more specifically, the war in neighbouring Yemen, which has been dubbed the “worst humanitarian crisis” in modern history of war. Amid the diplomatic row, the European Union joined the liberal bandwagon,  to shed light on the arrest of women rights activists and for the detainees to be granted due process to defend themselves. However, Saudi Arabia paid no heed to this. The plank of liberalism that MBS had boarded in pursuing its “reform” agenda is, thus, without moral legitimacy, as it lacks the primary principle of justice. In this backdrop of intensified crackdown on liberal voices in the country, there clearly emerges a war of ideas — where the Kingdom’s formidable claim of being the “guardian of the Islamic faith” faces challenge from alternative progressive voices from within, prominently the female voices that continue to struggle against the male guardianship system practised in the country. As the concept of “guardianship” — both of faith and the female counterpart — strengthens in the Kingdom along with the regional battles for hegemony, are the promised “reforms"" just a chimera?",2018-08-23,"Israa al-ghomgham,Chrystia freeland,Canada,Saudi Arabia",Saudi Arabia’s spat with Canada reflects a war of ideas within the Kingdom,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/saudi-arabia-canada-chrystia-freeland-israa-al-ghomgham-death-penalty-to-activists/story/1/26237.html
225,Hamza Ameer,"Former Indian cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Pakistan on the invitation of Prime Minister Imran Khan to attend his oath-taking ceremony on August 18, 2018. Sidhu, who is a close friend of Imran Khan, was all praise for the Pakistani premier since the time he received the invitation. Sidhu’s visit to Pakistan stayed in the spotlight as he, along with  , expressed great hope and called himself an “Ambassador of Peace”. The uproar started in India after Sidhu was seen sitting with Masood Khan, President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), aka Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK), which situation was then accompanied by a warm hug to the Pakistani Chief of Army Staff (COAS), General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who went to Sidhu during the oath-taking ceremony of PM Khan and Sidhu hugged him. While there was uproar and anger in India over this, Pakistan, on the other hand, was all praise for the former Indian cricketer, with high appreciation for Sidhu’s nature and his positive media talks about betterment in India-Pakistan relations. Sidhu expressed optimism that Imran Khan would steer his country out of crises and change its destiny. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Sidhu said the invitation extended to him by Khan was a message of love, friendship and peace for his countrymen. ""There was a deep message in Imran Khan's statement of taking two steps forward in response to one by India,"" he  . Sidhu added that it was an obligation for him to take the message to the government across the border to resolve all the disputes with Pakistan through dialogue. Sidhu’s visit to Pakistan is being seen as a positive move and is hailed across all quarters. “If Sidhu can advocate the love and respect he got from Pakistan, in front of his government in India, it will be a major breakthrough in the strained ties between the two arch rivals India and Pakistan,” said Javed Siddique, a senior political analyst. It was with respect to Sidhu’s visit that General Bajwa hinted towards opening the border at Kartarpura for Sikh pilgrims visiting Nankana Sahib to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak. ""Opening of the Kartarpura passage is an earnest desire of the Sikh community,"" Sidhu maintained. The warmth and regard that Sidhu received from Pakistan can be well established by his own statement. “I received lots of love and respect in Pakistan. I had also brought a message of love and friendship from India — but the people here reciprocated with compound interest,” he said.",2018-08-21,"Pakistan,Imran Khan,Qamar Javed Bajwa,Navjot Singh Sidhu","Hated at home, loved across the border: Why Pakistan is all praise for Navjot Singh Sidhu",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/navjot-singh-sidhu-general-qamar-javed-bajwa-hug-pakistan-imran-khan-kartarpura/story/1/26184.html
226,Pathikrit Sanyal,"A man, who claims to be the Bajrang Dal district head for Agra, has made a video. Possibly recorded on the front-facing camera of a smartphone, the man, who identified himself as Sanjay Jaat, claimed that Navjeet Singh Sidhu — he didn’t get Navjot Sidhu’s name right — had betrayed the Hindus of the nation by hugging a Colonel of the Pakistan Army — he did not get General Qamar Javed Bajwa’s designation right either — despite Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, having warned his followers to never trust the “mullahs” — though many claim this is just falsity. Jaat’s message was not just a summary of his emotions about the former Indian cricketer and a member of the Indian National Congress hugging one of the most powerful men in Pakistan. No. It also came with an offer. “  (Whoever beheads traitors like him, Sanjay Jaat will give them this cheque worth Rs five lakh!),” he proclaimed, holding a   in front of the camera. While the details of the cheque in question were blurry in the video, the message was crystal clear: You can’t hug Pakistanis without hurting Hindus. Does a hug warrant a bounty on one’s head? Clearly, this purported Bajrang Dal leader feels so. And even if his views don’t represent that of most Indians, a large chunk of them still feels that what Sidhu did was wrong. Even if they don’t feel comfortable with the idea of Sidhu being beheaded on the behest of an apparent Hindutva hardliner, they certainly feel that Sidhu is a traitor. On the one hand, we have Punjab Chief Minister  , who told the press that, “Every day our jawans are getting martyred. To hug their Chief General Bajwa, I am against this. The fact is that the man should understand that our soldiers are being killed. My own regiment lost one Major and two jawans a few months ago and every day, somebody is being shot,"" adding, “It was wrong of him to have shown affection towards the Pakistan Army Chief.” On the other hand, there is Shiv Sena chief  , who, though taking a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), dubbed Sidhu’s actions as “heights of shamelessness”, adding that should the Punjab minister have so much affection for a Pakistani General, he ought to consider contesting elections from across the border. And leaving political entities aside, for they always need sound bites and they have their political agendas to see through, citizens too feel aggrieved that not only did Sidhu visit Pakistan to attend the oath-taking ceremony of the country’s new premier Imran Khan (who happens to be an old cricket world colleague of Sidhu), but also that he felt it was okay to hug a man who heads the nation’s armed forces. Sudhir Kumar Ojha, a lawyer based in Bihar, has slapped a   against Sidhu. For what joy? According to Ojha’s petition, filed with Muzaffarpur’s chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Hari Prasad, Sidhu had insulted the families of Indian soldiers, killed by Pakistan’s army and terrorists sponsored by the country, by hugging General Bajwa and sitting next to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir’s president Masood Khan. Ojha also added that it was wrong of Sidhu to attend the celebrations in Pakistan just when India was mourning the death of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Sedition cases, casual utterances of the word “traitor”, bounties for decapitations. These are all things that are now ""normal"" reactions to a hug. On his part, Sidhu maintains that he was only reacting to General Bajwa telling him that he would open Kartarpur border on Guru Nanak Dev's 550th “Prakash Parv”. The Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib, after all, closely associated with the life of Guru Nanak, is considered one of the holiest shrines of the Sikhs. Is it wrong for a man to thank someone, even if it is a Pakistani general, for a promise of this magnitude? There is always room for criticism. With a geopolitical relationship as strained as India and Pakistan’s, any and all talks and actions need to be critically evaluated and, should it be required, reproved as well. But denunciations of Sidhu’s actions are vastly different from calling him seditious and treacherous and asking for his head to be served on a platter for the paltry sum of Rs five lakh. The normalisation of these extremities is both terrifying and already visible in a rapidly polarising India that is approaching one of its most crucial elections. And normalised they have been. One has only to look back to 2017 and see how a BJP member announced that   star Deepika Padukone and director Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s   would be rewarded with Rs 10 crore. One has only to look at the recent attack on student leader   that was most definitely a result of BJP supporters and leaders awarding him the tag of “traitor” (based on allegedly doctored tapes and a great deal of frenzied hearsay). The words “sedition” and “treason” are not things one can casually misuse. They carry a lot of weight. To casually hurl them at political opponents without considering the context or the reasons of their actions, is not just morally wrong — this is a dangerous precedent to set. But, perhaps, the precedent has already been set and the country is now reaping the rewards of a culture of calumny that has been in place for quite some time now.",2018-08-21,"Death Threats,Qamar Javed Bajwa,Sedition,Navjot Singh Sidhu",Navjot Singh Sidhu hugging Pakistan’s General Bajwa deserves sedition cases and bounties because that is the new ‘normal’,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/navjot-singh-sidhu-general-qamar-javed-bajwa-hug-pakistan-imran-khan-kartarpur-sedition-behead-threat-bounty/story/1/26194.html
227,Geeta Mohan,"The Imran Khan government in Pakistan comes with the   (a new Pakistan), in order to have a fresh beginning, a fresh start. Somewhere, we all want to believe it — but his administration's actions since August 18, when he took over as Prime Minister, and a few days before that, give out a different message. One that has the Pakistani establishment's footprints all over it. While Prime Minister Imran Khan in his first address to the nation focused on domestic issues, with no mention of India-Pakistan or Kashmir, Shah Mehmood Qureshi as the foreign minister ensured that the important aspects of Pakistan's India policy were not amiss from his first press interaction. A minister who seemed absolutely unprepared on his first day on the job. Why? Because why else would a foreign minister deliver his entire statement,  , only to be handed a slip last minute from his Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua? Why had he not been told about such an important development before going on and on about ""adventurism"" and ""accidental adventurism""? It is because, as is in the usual course, he did not take a brief from the Foreign Office officials before holding the briefing — which also was not a scheduled one. The massive confusion in interpreting the first most sensitive piece of news by the Imran Khan administration bordered on ""recklessness"". While Qureshi is not a greenhorn, he would have to tread very carefully and this casual, nonchalant handling of India is a real ""disservice"" to ties, quite opposed to Imran Khan and the Pakistani Foreign Office blaming sections of the Indian media for ""unnecessarily"" creating a controversy. India and Pakistan, more than understanding each other's concerns and sensitivities, have to be highly aware of each other's red-lines as both these governments ride on, and have come to power, on nationalistic agendas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, like many world leaders, did send a letter to congratulate Imran Khan and expressed commitment towards ""constructive engagement"" — but for Pakistan to interpret this even as an ""indication"" to initiate talks was at best presumptive on Pakistan's part.  The story of India and Pakistan has and will always be mired with mind games and tactics, but to make a pawn out of Navjot Singh Sidhu by  , president of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK), and trying to legitimise the Kashmir issue was churlish, to say the least. There were many layers of messaging. If indeed Pakistan is a democracy, then why did the Pak Army Chief convey the message on the   to Sidhu, rather than the civilian dispensation doing so? Frankly, much has been made about the hug between Sidhu and General Qamar Bajwa and much more politics has been played on this issue — but the fact is that Prime Minister Modi had also flown down to Lahore. In a first by an Indian Prime Minister, he boarded a Pak Air Force helicopter to go to Raiwind and then,   took place there. So, why the hullabaloo about this hug? Because Modi might not admit it, but surely some part of him rues the day he decided to go to Lahore since it was followed by the  . Similarly, as much as Sidhu would like to believe that he went as a private citizen, he is an elected leader, he has to cater to a constituency which comprises not only of those who welcomed his earnest action but also those who may have suffered at the hands of Pakistan — like those who lost their loved ones at the border and went seeking answers from Sidhu.  He is a politician and he will have to accept the consequences — a risk that could reap benefits or spell doom.  When it comes to India-Pakistan, what you expect almost never happens — what you don't expect most certainly will happen. And when you are not watching, the worst comes hitting. More opportunities have been lost in one-upmanship. It is time for a reality check. Imran has won an election decrying India. Modi has one to win in 2019.

228,Rajdeep Sardesai,"One of the biggest mistakes political journalists make is to often assess election trends based on talking to politicians. When Narendra Modi was Gujarat chief minister, any reporter who spoke to Mr Modi’s fellow politicians (be they rivals or even from the BJP) was convinced he was losing. In 2012, one of them wagered a dinner bet with me that creeping anti-incumbency against sitting MLAs would spell doom for Mr Modi. As it turned out, Mr Modi won a third successive election rather comfortably and I won my bet. The reason was simple: politicians disliked Mr Modi because he refused to share power with them but the voters seemed mesmerised by the Modi persona because he offered them hope and boundless positive energy as a potential change agent. The Gujarat political model now seems to be playing out in Delhi too as Mr Modi seeks re-election in 2019. The Congress under Rahul Gandhi seems certain that a well-crafted opposition ""maha-gatbandhan"" in key states like Uttar Pradesh will mean the end of Modi Raj. A Mayawati-Akhilesh alliance in particular is seen as the game-changer that could severely hit the BJP’s chances in the country’s most populous state where the BJP won as many as 73 of the 80 seats in 2019. Several BJP MPs will privately tell you that the government is in big trouble (what they won't tell you is that many of them may not even get tickets to contest this time). And yet, while local alliance arithmetic may work against the BJP, the chemistry of the prime minister is intact. Mr Modi’s 2018 Independence Day speech was, in fact, a reaffirmation of his original success formula: after four years in power, the prime minister with his formidable communication skills is still projecting himself as an anti-establishment political revolutionary who is out to reform the system. This is the energetic Mr Fix-It who wants to be seen as a feel-good guru in contrast with his opponents who he has cleverly boxed in as carping critics oozing negativity. That is how he had built his equity in the 2014 elections lead up: the only difference is that then he was the challenger, now he is the incumbent. So when Mr Modi with poetic flourish claims to be impatient for change, he is attempting to assuage the disillusioned voter who he has previously promised ""achche din"". When he contrasts himself as the ""kaamdaar"" (day-labourer) versus the ""namdaar"" (dynast), he is identifying himself once again as the meritorious ""outsider"" who is challenging the ancient regime based on elite privilege. When he contrasts his government with the UPA of 2013, he is again seeking to position himself as a muscular, decisive leader, unlike his predecessor. When he lists out his government’s achievements and proposes a series of big bang schemes on a range of issues from healthcare to electrification, then he is again trying to ride a wave of optimism: this is the India Rising dream which is being sold by an artful political dream merchant. In this sunny universe, there is no place for discussion over whether the targets have been met or not, or indeed, how the proposed budgetary allotments will suffice. The Modi discourse has no place for negativity and areas of darkness which is perhaps why there was no mention of lynchings and hate crimes in the speech. When Mr Modi claims to have rid the system of fixers and middlemen, he gets instant applause because he is seen to be striking at his own political class that is widely perceived to be thoroughly compromised and corrupted. It is this skilfully cultivated image of the prime minister as the non-corrupt ""karmayogi"" ""outsider"" which the opposition, especially the Congress, has been desperately trying to dent over the last four years. In 2015, the expensive self-embossed suit at a summit meeting with US President Barack Obama gave Rahul Gandhi an opportunity to target Mr Modi as a ""suit-boot kee sarkar"". The prime minister’s frequent foreign travels have been criticised too as evidence of Mr Modi’s fondness for VVIP luxury. In 2018, the Rafael aircraft controversy had led to charges of crony corruption and allegations of benefitting industrialist friends. The ""Ambani-Adani"" tag has been pinned on Mr Modi in the hope that this will convince the voter that the prime minister isn’t quite the humble ""chaiwallah"" he claims to be but is actually part of the power elite: the opposition hopes that the strategy will strip the ""outsider"" halo that remains Mr Modi’s USP. And yet, as almost every opinion poll has shown, the prime minister’s popular appeal is way above anyone else. This maybe partly because of his sharp political antennae that alert him to potential danger: notice how many times he referred to ""kisan"" and ""gareeb"" in his Independence Day speech in a clear attempt to offset any anger caused by agrarian distress. It may also be because the media, especially television, has provided him such a soft landing that there has been virtually no serious attempt made to question Mr Modi’s myth-making machine. It may also be a reflection of the state of the opposition: many of them have far too many skeletons in their cupboard to offer a credible ethical challenge to the moral failings of the Modi regime. For example, can a party like the Congress really question the Modi government on its links with big business without exposing itself to similar charges of having once provided windfall profits to the very forces who the prime minister is now accused of being chummy with? Which is why if the 2019 contest is pitched as Modi versus Rahul as the BJP’s campaign managers are attempting, then the prime minister remains in pole position to emerge victorious unless the Opposition is able to find a narrative that goes beyond just anti-Modiism or a much-hyped hug and a wink. What that narrative is remains unclear but when any criticism of the Modi cult is deemed ""anti-national"", then it isn’t going to be easy for a disjointed opposition to mount a sustained challenge.  Just ahead of the 2004 general elections, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, much like Mr Modi today, appeared unassailable. And yet, a couple of alliances went awry and allowed the Congress-led opposition to sneak in. “We took our victory for granted,” Mr Vajpayee’s key points-person Pramod Mahajan ruefully admitted later. It is unlikely that Mr Modi and his Man Friday Amit Shah will be as complacent.

229,Prabir Ghosal,"In an age of political alliances, the most successful Prime Minister that India has ever seen was Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Owing to his liberal views, his tolerance and his able leadership, he was popular across political parties. In the present political scenario, regional parties are becoming increasingly significant. Amid their ongoing bickering over various demands, one can’t help but remember Vajpayee, who knew how to handle political allies who were not on the same page on various issues. Forget the BJP, I have never come across any political leader of his stature in any party. PV Narasimha Rao ran a minority government with external support and Manmohan Singh ran a collation government. But I think Vajpayee rose above his party and became a leader of all. At times, many allies of his government were not happy with each other, but Vajpayee was the link. One of the biggest examples was Mamata Banerjee. There was a time during Vajpayee’s prime ministership when LK Advani and Mamata Banerjee were not on talking terms. But Mamata Banerjee never hesitated to go to Vajpayee. Even at that time, the BJP supported Banerjee, though she was not a minister. Banerjee was not willing to take up the coal ministry thinking that she would have to take the responsibility of a portfolio which was mired in controversies. But then  . Today, the scenario is completely different. Today’s BJP, which is far stronger than it was during Vajpayee’s time, is not being able to pacify parties like the Telugu Desam and Shiv Sena. The absence of a leader like Vajpayee can be felt. It’s his leadership to which the party owes much of its present strength. But Vajpayee, the person beyond politics, could easily come out of this political cloak and mingle with people. In the 1990s, when he used to come to Kolkata, he used to visit the house of   at Chittaranjan Avenue. In the evening, he would visit Prinsep Ghat and eat phuchka (golgappa). Those who know how small Mamata Banerjee’s Kalighat residence was would not second-guess how uncomfortable Vajpayee would have been there. And yet, the former Prime Minister spent long hours there — sweating but smiling. Though they belonged to two different political ideologies, there was no barrier between them. As a journalist, I saw a different Vajpayee in one of the meetings of BJP’s national executive committee. The meeting took place in Panjim, Goa. After the meeting, a beach party was organised which Vajapyee attended in a trouser and a casual shirt. He even recited poetry and mingled with everyone, including the journalists. It was a party meeting. So, every other leader was in dressed formals. But Vajpayee was completely in a party mood.",2018-08-20,"NDA,Mamata Banerjee,BJP,Atal Bihari Vajpayee",How Atal Bihari Vajpayee won over Mamata Banerjee,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/why-mamata-banerjee-joined-atal-bihari-vajpayee-winning-friends-and-influencing-people-was-vajpayees-great-achievement/story/1/26161.html
230,Mehr Tarar,"On August 17, 2018, in the first session of the new parliament, Pakistan elected its 22nd prime minister: Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi. A visibly overwhelmed with emotion Khan appeared at different times to be joyous, silent, meditative, misty-eyed; his political struggle of 22 years had finally reached one of its most important milestones. Amidst chants of protest from the main Opposition party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz — which having recently lost the elections after being in power for five years has still not been to accept the mandate of millions of Pakistanis that voted for Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) — Khan spoke to the nation second time after the July 25 elections. The tone was strident, words unapologetic, but the gist remained the same: Khan in government would focus on implementation of a system that works on the premise of improvement of the life of the common man, elimination of corruption, and full accountability of all who have harmed the country in any form. There was also the re-announcement to have all allegations of electoral rigging investigated. On August 18, 2018, Imran Khan in the oath-taking ceremony at the President House, Islamabad, pledged, with a fumble or two, to be faithful to the Constitution of Pakistan in fulfilment of his duties and responsibilities as the prime minister of Pakistan. While there were some grim tweets and some sullen faces on television, the overall mood of Pakistan on August 18 was that of positivity, optimism and hope: the decades-old status quo of the power of two parties and two families having received a tremendous electoral blow seems to have given way to an untried party whose leader may have made political mistakes, but who is steadfast and consistent about his fundamental narrative: a Pakistan that is for all, is fair, equal, compassionate, empathetic, and is free of corruption. Other than the now much-viralled image of a simple black sherwani-attired Khan, the sight millions of Pakistanis watched with unbridled joy and prayers for their new premier, the most note-worthy takeaway from Khan’s swearing-in ceremony is the gracious interaction between Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Bajwa and our honourable guest from India, Khan’s old friend, cricketer-turned-politician, Navjot Singh Sidhu. In the few-minute conversation General Bajwa reportedly said: “I’m a general who wanted to be a cricketer... Navjot, we want peace ... When you celebrate the 550th birthday of Baba Nanak ... we’ll open the Kartarpur-Sahib Corridor... We’ll even think of doing better things.” The interaction that many Pakistanis cheered as Pakistan’s willingness to have a friendly relationship with India, and that received a huge backlash from many rightwing Indians, including those who represent the ruling BJP, to me it is simply a reiteration of my oft-repeated stance that the Pakistan military establishment despite naysayers on both sides saying the opposite wishes to have peace with India. I call it the first victory, albeit unintended, of Khan’s positive image and the power of cricket! The announcement of a cabinet comprising 15 ministers and five advisers is an immediate manifestation of Khan’s resolve to keep his government free of pomp and extravagance, and focused on short and long term establishment and implementation of strategies and policies for tackling of micro and macro issues besetting Pakistan. On August 19, in the Punjab Assembly, the PTI’s candidate Sardar Usman Buzdar defeated Hamza Sharif, the scion of the Sharif family that has ruled Punjab in the last ten years. In August 2018, PTI has formed government in the Centre, in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. PTI is in coalition with the ruling party in Balochistan, and is a strong new opposition in Sindh. Politically, it is a stunning victory of the mandate of millions of Pakistanis who have rejected the two-party system giving way to a party that seemed like a political pariah during most of its 22 years of existence. The challenges are myriad, foreign debt is at PKR 28,000 billion, the options limited, optimism lower than temperature in Tokyo in January, and cynicism and naysaying as high as Kangchenjunga, but Khan’s biggest quality other than his cricketing excellence and his deep compassion for the poor is his determination. Khan has promised to work for a new Pakistan, and while millions believe the sincerity of his vision and his dream, only time and deeds will prove the validity or superciliousness of his promises. Khan wishes to turn Pakistan into an Islamic welfare state, where each life is valued, where no one suffers forgotten. Civilian supremacy that others just toss around as big, fancy words will only become a reality if Khan’s words of changing the system become a reality. Strengthening of civilian institutions; de-politicisation of bureaucracy and police; reforms in healthcare, education, local body system, taxation; superiority of meritocracy; national self-reliance, freedom from financial reliance on friends and fair-weather allies; stabilisation of relations with neighbouring countries, and formation of bilateral relations with all countries based on mutual respect and bilateral interests. Khan in his first official address to the nation on August 19, 2018, stunned Pakistan. In the very long history of televised speeches of elected prime ministers and military dictators who became presidents, the jaded, weary and wary Pakistani nation could not have been in much of anticipation about another long speech written by a team of eloquent but unemotional speechwriters, read in a monotone by a bored-looking prime minister. Khan, yet again proved everyone wrong. Khan did not read a written speech: Khan spoke to the nation. And the nation listened...rapt, incredulous, impassioned. Glancing at talking points from sheets of what was recycled paper Khan did not address the people of Pakistan. It was as if he held a special conversation with each one of us. He talked about things that matter. The fundamentals. The principal point was the formation of an Islamic welfare state on the lines of the 7 th century Medina. Interestingly, this Islamic welfare state is very close to the dynamics of a modern day western welfare state. Highlighting that the Prime Minister House has a staff of 524, and 80 cars, Khan’s new residence will be a small house on the premises of the Prime Minister House in which he would use two staff members and two cars. Austerity will be the principle followed by not just Khan but his entire cabinet and all his parliamentarians, announcing that the Prime Minister House will be converted into a research university, and all Governor Houses into something of utility for the awam. Walking the talk, Khan stressed: “Allah also says in the Quran that He does not change the condition of a nation if it does not make an effort itself. We will have to change our thinking. We will have to invoke kindness in our hearts as half our population cannot even get meals two times a day.” Khan touched upon subjects not many prime ministers mention in their first or even 100 th speech: HDI, stunted growth of children, child and mother mortality, out-of-school children, prevention of sexual abuse of children, rehabilitation of street children, justice to orphans and widows, climate change, rule of law, implementation of National Accountability Plan for elimination of terrorism, fiscal accountability, plans to tackle water shortage, quality healthcare for all, quality public education, low-cost housing, job opportunities, modernisation of madrassa education, speedy dispensation of justice, condition of poor prisoners, Pakistani expats languishing in foreign jails, agriculture, police and bureaucracy reforms, development of tourism, progressive taxation, self-reliance, FBR, better relations with all neighbouring countries, end of fiscal dependence on other countries. The list is endless, the sentiment is right there: Making Pakistan a country that is for all, and not the select few. During and after Khan’s speech, my Twitter timeline was full of praise, admiration, respect and awe for a leader supported by many, and derided by more. Tweet after tweet, one reaction remained identical: the speech was the first of its kind by an elected prime minister, and its crux was positive optimism. For the first time ever, I paid attention to a speech, rapt, hoping it didn’t end soon. For the first time ever, in my lifelong viewing of televised speeches of Pakistani leaders, it was a prime minister talking directly to his nation. For the first time ever, a prime minister talked about people who are forgotten. What moved me the most, the most important thing for me in the speech: the way Prime Minister Khan’s voice changes when he talks about the poor, the underprivileged. Khan is the leader who truly cares about the poor, and that to me is his most important quality. Finally, Pakistan has a leader who truly cares about changing the life of the common man. It is not that each thing that Prime Minister Imran Khan said will come true. What is important: his conviction that it will. And Khan promised that despite the tremendous odds, he is there for the nation every step of the way. And while doing that, he looked straight in the camera as if he was making a personal pledge to each Pakistani, to each one of us. For the first time ever, I am proud of having supported and voted for the right leader.

231,Beena Sarwar,"For many Pakistanis, the late former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee stands out as the co-architect of the   in February 1999 together with the-then Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. In this context, Vajpayee’s defining moment came during that visit when he became the first Indian statesman to initiate a visit to the Minar-e-Pakistan. Vajpayee’s Minar-e-Pakistan visit, a hugely significant gesture, was the “biggest event” between India and Pakistan, to quote Mushahid Hussain Syed, then-information minister. This marble, tile and stone minaret built in 1960 marks the place where the   was passed in what was then Minto Park (now Iqbal Park), calling for greater Muslim autonomy within British India. The park lies on the outskirts of Lahore’s Walled City, near the Badshahi Masjid and Lahore Fort. Now commonly called the Pakistan Resolution, the declaration, in fact, makes no mention of Pakistan. But it did give the All India Muslim League greater impetus to push for an independent nation-state. For Vajpayee to initiate a visit in homage to this spot speaks of his trademark humility that so many have paid tribute to. It stemmed from his sincerity in building peace, but was also a consummate political move, in keeping with his great statesmanship. On the one hand, it rendered speechless the naysayers in Pakistan who balk at building peace with India because, they say, “India has never accepted the reality of Pakistan.” On the other hand, it silenced the right-wing Hindutva lobby in India that refused to accept the reality of Pakistan and aspired for a united India – Akhand Bharat – under the saffron banner. Although Vajpayee’s constituency was this very Hindutva right-wing, he was a realist. He had not only the moral courage, but also the humility to able to rise above his own ideology for the sake of the larger cause: peace between India and Pakistan, peace in the region. That Lahore visit, marked by idealism, excitement and hope, took place after  , with Pakistan following suit. The tests were a game-changer. We have seen what nuclear weapons can do. Two abiding universal resolves that emerged from the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are: Never forget, and never again. With the eyes of the world upon them, both Sharif and Vajpayee were acutely aware that now more than ever before, dialogue was the only option. Journalist Kingshuk Nag in his political biography of Vajpayee,  , adds an interesting bit of information to this scenario. He writes that in the mid-1960s Vajpayee’s mentor in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, in conjunction with socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia, “had come up with the concept of a confederation of India and Pakistan”. Repudiating the Akhand Bharat demand, this out-of-the-box thinking paved the way for good bilateral relations between India and Pakistan. The nuclear tests, writes Nag, made Vajpayee acutely aware of the need to push this agenda.   Vajpayee was well aware of the opposition both at home, in India, and in Pakistan. As he famously said during that momentous trip, Pakistan did not need his or India’s ‘mohr’ (stamp) to be accepted as reality — its creation was already a reality. His visit to Minar-e-Pakistan magnanimously demonstrated his acceptance of this truth. This was a move that he himself initiated on his Lahore trip, inaugurating the Delhi-Lahore air-conditioned bus service, accompanied by several prominent Indians from the fields of media, film, art, culture and cricket, including Shatrughan Sinha, Mallika Sarabhai, Arun Shourie, Javed Akhtar, Satish Gujral, Kuldip Nayar and Kapil Dev besides the official delegation and some family members. ""This is a defining moment in South Asian history and we will have to rise to the challenge,"" Vajpayee told Nawaz Sharif at the time. Pakistan’s right-wing, the other side of the coin to India’s, was not impressed by Vajpayee’s gesture of peace. Perhaps prodded by the ‘invisible forces’ or ‘falahi makhlooq’ that sabotage any moves towards peace between the two countries, the Jamat-e-Islami came out in full force to protest his visit. Their demonstrations on Lahore’s Mall Road halted traffic. The politically motivated nature of their protests is evident in their petty action, weeks later on March 23, to “purify” the Minar-e-Pakistan, scrubbing the spot with rose water where Vajpayee had stood because his visit had “defiled” it.    Their February 1999 protests meant that Vajpayee, staying at Governor House on Mall Road in the heart of Lahore, couldn’t leave for his dinner appointment on the other side of town at the Lahore Fort. The government ordered the police to disperse the protestors, which the police did with gusto, their batons and tear gas injuring many demonstrators. Officials of the Foreign Ministry wanted to tell Vajpayee that the delay was due to “technical issues” but Mushahid Hussain brushed aside their face-saving efforts and told the Indian prime minister that they were stuck because of street protests. Vajpayee waved aside his apology, saying, “It happens in India too”. Later, reaching Lahore Fort, Vajpayee wanted to visit the Gurudwara by its side. The Jamat had been forcibly dispersed from Iqbal Park earlier, and whiffs of tear gas wafted through the air. As Vajpayee’s eyes began to water, an embarrassed Mushahid tried to offer him a tissue. But Vajpayee had already taken out his own handkerchief. Smiling, he reassured Mushahid, saying he was used to this too. The ill-advised Kargil war initiated by then-Pakistan Army Chief General Pervez Musharraf later sabotaged the Lahore Declaration. But let it also be remembered that Vajpayee reciprocated the famous handshake by that very Musharraf in Kathmandu and later sat at the dialogue table with him in Agra. That this process too could not move beyond the promise it held again has less to do with Vajpayee than with those on both sides who regularly sabotage any attempts at peace between the two countries. In the final analysis, whatever his flaws and ideological political moorings, when it came to building peace in the region, Atal Bihari Vajpayee showed the kind of moral courage and political will that today’s leaders would do well to learn from.",2018-08-17,"Pakistan,Diplomacy,Nawaz Sharif,Atal Bihari Vajpayee",Why Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a man of peace,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/atal-bihari-vajpayee-nawaz-sharif-peace-pakistan-kargil/story/1/26109.html
232,Majid Hyderi,"A poet by heart, a politician by mind, and among the wittiest men, former Prime Minister and BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee will long be remembered for many things — especially his vision on Kashmir. As a committed politician, he lived up to two of his iconic phrases centered around the K-issue. One was with regard to Kashmir, where he spoke about a solution through “Kashmiriyat, Jamhooriyat aur Insaniyat”. The other one was about relations with Pakistan where he said, “ ,   (We can change friends but not neighbours).” Both the phrases sound inspirational, exemplary and immortal. Here’s why. Widely admired as an ambassador of peace, his twin commitments became the benchmark of politics — something which successive regimes and even hardline separatists endorsed from time to time. But for Vajpayee, all this started with the shock  .  A war that stretched between May and July that year ended with India’s victory. Pakistani Army infiltrators, who had taken India by surprise, were weeded out under a military action code-named Operation Vijay. Within two years of the breach of trust by Pakistan, however, a large-hearted Vajpayee was again ready with his hand of friendship outstretched towards the ""irreplaceable neighbour"". In  , where a number of issues, including Kashmir, were discussed. But moments before the historic pact was supposed to be signed, visiting Pakistani military-dictator General Parvez Musharaff abandoned the meet and flew back to Islamabad. Though time faded away, Vajpayee’s commitments didn’t. Two years later, on April 21, 2003, he sounded more confident. After concluding a visit to Jammu and Kashmir, the-then PM spelt out his perspective before Parliament on the way to deal with Kashmir and manage relations with Pakistan. In his speech,  : “I assured the people of Jammu and Kashmir that we wish to resolve all issues — both domestic and external — through talks. I stressed that the gun can solve no problem; brotherhood can. Issues can be resolved if we move forward guided by the three principles of Insaaniyat (humanism), Jamhooriyat (democracy) and Kashmiriyat (Kashmir's age-old legacy of amity).” “In my speech, I spoke of extending our hand of friendship to Pakistan. At the same time, I also said that this hand of friendship should be extended by both sides. Both countries should resolve that we need to live together in peace,” he added. The same year, in November, India and Pakistan signed a formal agreement for a ceasefire along the international border, the LoC and the Actual Ground Position Line in J&K.  A year passed peacefully and there were more path-breaking developments. The moderate faction of the   held talks with him in New Delhi. It was the first such formal dialogue between the PM and separatists since the eruption of armed insurgency in Kashmir, taking the issue from aggressive counter-insurgency operations to boardroom diplomacies of the highest order. As all good things come to an end, so did Vajpayee’s tenure. But his deliverance on Kashmir continued to bear fruit. In 2015, his successor,  , flagged off the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service, which was actually Vajpayee’s brainchild, a plan the latter had formally initiated in 2003.  But then, after Vajpayee, his successors couldn’t take any significant steps forward. From his successors, Manmohan Singh to Narendra Modi, none of the two could achieve anything path-breaking that could overshadow Vajpayee’s impact on Kashmir. For Manmohan Singh, it was two subsequent stints at his disposal. But the fall-outs of his decade of inability on Kashmir were visible. By 2008, Kashmir was simmering with major street protests against the   that year. Though the agitation subsided with the collapse of the PDP-Congress in the state, within two years, Kashmir erupted with bigger unrest. Over  Within the next two years, the revival of militancy started to haunt the state and armed insurgency continues to fester.  Pakistan's breach of the ceasefire agreement, on the other hand, added to the mess. In 2014, BJP’s victory in the Parliament elections brought a new hope when Prime Minister Narendra Modi invoked Vajpayee’s 'Kashmiriyat, Jamhooriyat aur Insaniyat' as key to address the Kashmir issue. But then, for Modi, Vajpayee’s mantra seemed restricted to a proverbial recitation — Kashmir went from bad to worse with the killing of Hizb commander  . For about the next six months, Kashmir witnessed its longest-ever agitation, with around 100 killed and more than 20,000 wounded in street protests. Despite resumption of normal life, the situation continued to be uneasy.  Interestingly, in 2017, even hardline separatist leader  evoked 'Insaniyat, Jamhooriyat, Kashmiriyat' to resolve the Kashmir dispute – the ideas he had actually derided when Vajpayee propagated them first.  For Vajpayee, the Agra Summit is seen as his only “fiasco”. But time exonerated him of the alleged failure. In 2006, General Pervez Musharraf, in his biography  , wrote that both he and Vajpayee had been ""humiliated"" at the 2001 summit ""by someone above"" the two of them. Exactly a decade later, former RAW chief AS Dulat in his book,   apparently claimed that deputy PM LK Advani had “destroyed” the summit. It was perhaps the only development related to Kashmir, and relations with Pakistan, where Vajpayee had reposed blind faith in his close aid, Advani. Well, anecdotes aside, we must return to the present-day BJP government. Having emerged victorious with a strong majority, the Modi sarkar was expected to be much more impactful on Kashmir than the comparatively unstable Vajpayee government. But in reality, Vajpayee’s deliverance on “Insaniyat, Kashmiriyat aur Jamhooriyat” ended up as a mere inspirational phrase, which Modi proverbially recites on big days. He repeated the same while delivering the 72nd Independence Day Speech from the Red Fort yesterday. Vajpayee’s relationship with Kashmir is not about his life or his passing though. It is about the eternal enigma of his mantra — a trinity on Kashmir, dovetailed in one phrase: Kashmiriyat, Jamhooriyat aur Insaniyat.",2018-08-16,"Atal Bihari Vajpayee,Atal bihari vajpayee death,BJP,Kashmir","Impact Atal: PM Vajpayee's influence on Kashmir was far greater than his successors', including Narendra Modi",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/atal-bihari-vajpayee-impact-kashmir-valley-kashmiriyat-jamhooriyat-insaniyat-modi-bjp/story/1/26103.html
233,Colonel Vivek Chadha,"As accolades, outpourings of emotion and affection from both sides of the divide, within and beyond the borders, flow freely, Atal Bihari Vajpayee's contributions, buried in the daily drivel of breaking news, fed over the years, have re-emerged to provide a collective glimpse of his achievements. Amongst the many that will deservedly make the list, Vajpayee’s contributions to national security will remain some of his most significant endeavours, in the process of nation-building. A closer look at five of his achievements, provides a deeper understanding of the man who could stand firm against the tirade of criticism that emanated from every corner of the world after the nuclear tests in 1998, and remain steadfast in his belief against all odds during the Kargil conflict, with equal confidence and poise. There are a number of factors that have contributed to India’s standing on the world stage. Among these, the stature of a mature, responsible and reliable nuclear power has reinforced it immeasurably since 1998. It was during the first, albeit short tenure of the NDA government that Vajpayee took the decision to go nuclear in the wake of five tests conducted at Pokhran. This was followed by one of the most hectic and dextrous diplomatic initiatives to justify India’s position on the world stage. India’s success can be gauged by the turnaround in relations with the United States shortly thereafter, with the visit by US President Clinton in 2000. The stamp of Vajpayee’s maturity was further evident from the draft nuclear doctrine that outlined India’s stance, a document which in its final form, continues to guide the country’s policy. For many, Vajpayee’s initiative to give peace a chance at Lahore in 1999 might seem misplaced, given that Pakistan followed it up with Kargil. However, the statesman reinforced India’s stand on the status of Pakistan as a sovereign state, when he visited the symbolically important Minar-e-Pakistan. In doing so, he attempted to remove any misgivings that the people of Pakistan may have had regarding India’s intentions towards their country. He also reiterated that peace, however elusive, was India’s ultimate goal. In Lahore, Vajpayee emerged as someone who was not afraid to pursue a radical security paradigm, despite the personal risks involved. May 1999 was a shocker for not only India and the world at large, but more so for Vajpayee. The personal capital that the Prime Minister had invested in Pakistan’s leadership, proved to be a liability. Casting aside the disappointment, Vajpayee led India’s effort to recover the icy heights from the Pakistani Army. He had the understanding and vision to restrict the conflict to Kargil and simultaneously the iron will to employ everything at the country’s disposal to evict the enemy. The achievement of the armed forces, unparalleled as these were, became a reality through the cohesive and coherent war machinery knit together under the Prime Minister’s leadership. India’s approach was best enshrined in his name — “Atal” or steadfast. The post-Kargil period was a test case for India in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). The security challenges faced by the state peaked during this period. Vajpayee understood the criticality of regaining moral superiority as well as security stability. He ensured free and fair elections, which were acknowledged as such by every independent observer. This was accompanied by his policy of reaching out to the common people of the state. The call for 'Kashmiriyat, Insaniyat and Jamhooriyat' has since become the underlying principle for building bridges with sections of the estranged population in the state. Vajpayee was and remains the symbol of Kashmir’s undiluted admiration. The immediate aftermath of the Kargil conflict saw the setting up of the Kargil Review Committee. The committee under the chairmanship of acclaimed strategist K Subrahmanyam revisited the conflict. It gave far-reaching recommendations in a number of domains, with an aim of strengthening national security. The path breaking report was made public, a departure from previous fact-finding attempts. This was followed by recommendations by a group of ministers (GoM) on vital areas of national security. Between the two, India embarked on a series of initiatives to strengthen the country’s security architecture, defence preparedness and equipment profile. These reforms remain the bedrock of India’s national security and the basis for further evolution of the same. The former Prime Minister, knitted his thoughts in flashes of poetry and conveyed them through the power of oratory. However, above all, he remained a true patriot, who could bridge differences and build consensus, which was and continues to remain a fundamental guideline on matters of national security.  ",2018-08-17,"Pakistan,India,Atal Bihari Vajpayee,National security",Five contributions Atal Bihari Vajpayee made to India’s national security,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/atal-bihari-vajpayee-national-security-kashmir-india-pakistan/story/1/26113.html
234,Sanjaya Baru,"Atal Bihari Vajpayee will be universally remembered as one of India’s great Prime Ministers. His uniqueness lies in the fact that his admirers cut across party political lines. Without doubt, he would be one of the four great Prime Ministers — including Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and P V Narasimha Rao. Each left an indelible imprint on India’s social, political and economic development. Their impact on India’s image abroad has been equally significant. However, given the political environment today, with its extreme partisanship, those who are admirers of Nehru and Indira may not think much of a Narasimha Rao or even a Manmohan Singh. Equally, those who are admirers of Narendra Modi would not think much of either Nehru or Indira. It is therefore significant that Atalji, as he’s universally referred to, is loved by all. It is even possible that he would be India’s most popular Prime Minister in the neighbourhood from Sri Lanka to Pakistan. He was the author of both a new outreach to Pakistan and the  . What exactly explains the secret of Atalji’s universal popularity? First, his graceful and endearing personality. He respected all and, in turn, got everyone’s respect. Early in his political career, Jawaharlal Nehru identified him as a future Prime Minister of India. When he went to Pakistan as Prime Minister, he stunned the Pakistani people with his visit to Minar-e-Pakistan. Second, Vajpayee was a true patriot and a nationalist who spoke for every Indian when he championed the national cause. As Leader of Opposition, in 1994, he accompanied the Minister of State for External Affairs, Salman Khurshid, to the UN Human Rights Commission, defending India’s record in  . Third, while Atalji had the opportunity to authorise nuclear weapon tests in 1998, after his predecessors had done all the preparatory work, full credit goes to him for the manner in which he defended India’s decision against great international odds — and for crafting the ‘ ’ doctrine, against even internal opposition. Finally, Atalji’s greatness also lay in the fact that he understood what India needed in terms of policy once he became Prime Minister — and he provided un-stinted leadership to take that policy forward. After all, both on account of economic policy and national security, the framework had in fact been defined by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. The Bharatiya Janata Party was in fact a critic of many things that Prime Minister Rao began, especially his economic policies — but Atalji quickly grasped the relevance of the policies he had inherited and carried them forward. They stood him in good stead when the United States imposed sanctions on India after the nuclear tests of 1998. Most think of the nuclear tests as Atalji’s most important legacy. However, his even greater contribution lay in the many projects that he launched for India’s long-term economic development. The  , connecting New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and back to Delhi, was the most significant infrastructure project taken up after Jawaharlal Nehru’s many irrigation projects. Atalji saw connectivity as the key to development. The rapid spread of telecommunication systems during his time helped in the emergence of India as a major information technology provider. Atalji’s leadership during the Kargil War and his astute decision-making, limiting the conflict to the Line of Control but not hesitating to flex India’s air power, greatly enhanced India’s prestige internationally. The   was won not just on the rocky heights of the Himalayas but also in the lofty halls of diplomacy. At the end of it, the United States was encouraged to finally recognise the Line of Control as the virtual border between India and Pakistan. In his last two years as Prime Minister, Atalji took two major initiatives that laid the foundation for what became his successor’s signature policies. His  to Pakistan, and to the people of Kashmir in 2003, was the basis for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s conversations with President Pervez Musharraf. The fact that a BJP leader was willing to think out of the box emboldened his Congress party successor to take that initiative forward. The foundation for Prime Minister Singh’s single most important achievement — the US-India civil nuclear agreement — was also laid by Atalji. His calling the US India’s “natural ally” set the tone for an engagement that has since been called by a US President “the defining partnership of the 21st century”. Atalji’s government took the “First Steps” in strategic partnership with the US enabling Prime Minister Singh to take the “Next Steps” (NSSP). In the end, while political analysts will list Atalji’s various policy initiatives, the people of India will remember him as a great human being, known for his masterly oration, his wit and wisdom, his poetry and his laughter. No other politician in recent times has endeared himself to the entire nation in the manner in which Atalji did with his warmth and his charm.",2018-08-16,"Nuclear policy,Kashmir,India-pakistan dialogue,Atal Bihari Vajpayee",Atal Bihari Vajpayee – A politician who was loved across party lines,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/atal-bihari-vajpayee-bjp-congress-party-lines-nawaz-sharif-kalam-pv-narasimha-rao-pokhran-kargil-kashmir/story/1/26092.html
235,Arshad khan,"Making a promise is one of the easiest things in the world; all people make promises but the majority fail to keep them.  Having said so when it comes to the promises made by the head of the government in a democracy to his people, those promises should transform into concrete policy decisions and need to be incorporated in the law books of the country and implemented on the ground. In that context, the words and promises of the Prime Minister of the largest democracy of the world should have more weight and complete homework is expected to have been made before uttering these words and promises.  Normally, adequate follow up is conducted to put the promises and words in to action. For Jammu and Kashmir, there is always a huge gap between the words and deeds of Indian Prime Ministers, from Jawaharlal Nehru to the incumbent Narendra Modi. This is, at least, how a major section of the population in Kashmir views the promises that have been made to them. From the pulpit of Red Ford the incumbent Prime Minister of India on the occasion of Independence Day speech made few more promises with the people of the state. These promises include about holding of Panchayat elections in the state and adopting the approach of  ,   and   for resolution of the Kashmir issue. This is the same approach which was adopted by the former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee. One thing which must be accepted here is that there were great expectations associated with the approach of the former PM and a degree of confidence was achieved. If anybody seemed sincere to the people of the state it was, without a doubt, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But, the abandonment of the Vajpayee doctrine created more confusion, doubt and suspicion in the minds of the Kashmiri people. A national party in a democracy must have a roadmap about dealing with all the main problems of the country. The Bharatiya Janta Party as a national party is also expected to have well defined course to deal with all problems including the Kashmir issue. The Vajpayee doctrine was considered as the answer to this problem. However, the party seemed insincere towards this doctrine once it came to power in the year 2014. Once the party gained power in the centre, the tone and tenor of the government policy changed towards the Kashmir issue and it seemed that the party has given up the approach of Vajpayee altogether. Instead a hardliner approach was adopted and the party talked mostly the language of power which failed to make any positive impact on the ground. Nonetheless, coming to the fresh promises, they were long overdue. They should have been made earlier, especially the one with respect to the resolution of the Kashmir issue. Were these promise(s) made during the first year of the National Democratic Alliance the situation on the ground may have been different. Here, one cannot afford to deny what the Prime Minister has said: Kashmiri people need to be embraced, and gun is no solution to the problem. The people of Kashmir in particular have suffered a lot and as the head of a democratic government, which claims to represent the same people. The government should have started working for these people at the very outset. Not just that, the PM should himself have been working for these people. This particular promise, of course, has been perceived as another election gimmick by majority of the people of the state. Coming to Panchayat elections, the situation is not conducive for holding of any elections in Kashmir. The stark and sad reality is that the Parliamentary elections of the Anantnag Parliamentary seat were not held and those for the Srinagar-Budgam parliamentary constituency also saw so low percentage of votes that took all the credibility away from these elections. Under such circumstances if the government is adamant to hold Panchayat elections, one has to wonder how such a thing would be possible. Isn’t it better to first, make conditions conducive for elections, and only then move towards polls? Otherwise elections, if at all held, might be counterproductive and even an embarrassment to the government. As the Prime Minister of the largest of democracy in the world, there is no reason to doubt the words and promise of Narendra Modi. But considering the level of distrust that has been growing in people of Kashmir; the response of the people has been lukewarm. The need of the hour is that PM Modi works for the real interests of the country. Kashmiri people need to be embraced and the conditions for the people of Kashmir need to be eased out.",2018-08-16,"Narendra Modi,Atal Bihari Vajpayee,Independence Day speech,Kashmir",India needs to move beyond promises to embrace Kashmiris,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kashmir-independence-day-speech-narendra-modi-atal-bihari-vajpayee/story/1/26094.html
236,Aroon Purie,"Narendra Modi’s stunning victory in 2014 — in which the BJP got a full majority on its own, the first time any party had done so in 25 years — changed the political landscape of the country. It held the promise of political stability and a decisive government. Many considered it a great boon for the country. However, as often happens, boons come with their own curse. In this case, it was hubris. The BJP ignored its allies. Oldest ally Shiv Sena is in a sulk in Maharashtra. The TDP’s N Chandrababu Naidu walked out of the NDA this March, alleging unfair treatment and neglect. The Shiromani Akali Dal is upset. Their back-again ally in Bihar, the JD(U), is bristling. The NDA has remained headless since 2013 and allia­nce members have not met since 2015. All this assumes great significance now as our latest India Today-Karvy Insights Mood of the Nation (MOTN) poll shows that the BJP is going to need every one of these disgrun­tled allies and more if it has to get a simple majority in 2019. Yet, in spite of the attrition of allies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains head and shou­lders above other leaders: 49 per cent of the respondents feel he is best suited to be the next prime minister. What is worrying for the BJP, however, is that our poll shows Rahul Gandhi closing in. With 27 per cent of the respondents endorsing the Congress president for the post of PM, the gap between him and Prime Minister Modi has narrowed to just 22 percentage points, from 55 percentage points in January 2017. Besides, with the opposition parties attempting to form a mahagathbandhan (grand alliance), the BJP has even greater cause for anxiety. Two hypothetical MOTN scenarios, where the unity of the opposition parties is high, point to the fact that it could be a close call for both the NDA and UPA, with neither getting a majority. In which case, it will be a triumph of arithmetic over personality. The battle then will not be Modi versus the rest but NDA+ versus UPA+. There have been early signs of this, in the drama in Bengaluru after the Karnataka poll results and in the bypoll victories in Uttar Pradesh. This is why allies are going to matter most for the BJP, and it has to be prepared to manage a coalition without a majority of its own. The NDA is working hard to ensure the people don’t get a chance to find out. It has slo­wly started adding on allies, from Telangana chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao to YSR Congress leader Jaganmohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh and the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu. The Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal also helped NDA candidate Hari­vansh Narayan Singh of the JD(U) win the recent election for deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha. It also showed the BJP’s ability to patch up with disgruntled allies such as the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U). Similarly, the Congress is pushing for a pre-poll alliance with strong regional parties, such as the TMC, SP and BSP. All of them have been bitter rivals in the past, but are united in their ambition to oust the Modi-led BJP government. So the big question for the two blocks is how to maintain existing allies and find as many as they can with pre- and post-poll alliances. In all probability, we are heading once again towards an era of coalitions. Undoubtedly, the Modi government has been on steroids, launching new schemes and revamping old ones, combined with major institutional reforms. The next elections will be a big test of the success of its major schemes. According to our poll, the BJP will be on a sticky wicket if it is going to rely only on its achievements to get votes, as the satisfaction with their performance is sliding, specially on the jobs front. The other worrying finding is that caste violence has emerged as the biggest threat to internal security, ahead of cross-border terrorism and communal violence, in our survey. Hopefully, this will be kept out of electioneering. Psephologist-turned-politician Yogendra Yadav put it well when he said the BJP will win the next elections because of 3 Ms—Modi, Media and Machine (election). He could have added another M—Money. To counter the Ms, he advises three Ps—Principles, Policy and Political Roadmap. At the moment, the mahagathbandhan seems to lack these. That aside, what any contender for power must offer is — hope. That’s what Modi did in 2014. Where that hope will come from, nobody knows yet. But never underestimate the wisdom of the Indian voter. Many a mighty have made that mistake.

237,Nazia Erum,"Last week, a right-leaning friend messaged me that she had been ‘attacked’ by a set of ‘liberals’ because she had spoken ‘a few lines’ in favour of the BJP. She said, ‘I was called a Muslim hater and assaulted by 20 people. So, you see, when you say all Muslims are scared, this is what we Hindus are made to go through. That every Hindu who supports BJP is termed a Muslim hater… this is not acceptable.” I was taken aback by her last statement – every Hindu who supports BJP is a Muslim hater – is that what all the ‘liberal’ dialogue had communicated? If yes, then this is an utter failure. The friend further said, “This has helped me see things and people more clearly and get wiser. It’s a huge help. Am glad it happened. Confirmed my perceptions. Now I see how deeply hate runs in our country, especially among the urban elite.” I must tell you, this friend is reasonably well-educated from a premier management institution and has been in the business of human resources since decades. Now she devotes much of her time working for the upliftment of less privileged communities irrespective of their caste and religion. She is deeply spiritual and goes out of her way to strengthen gender-specific and environmentally sensitive initiatives. She is everything that would identify with all accepted meanings of being 'liberal'. But she is angry at this very creed. Perhaps because there is a new ‘us vs them’ in our lexicon. What started with India (us) vs Pakistan (them) soon became Hindu (us) vs Muslims (them) – and has now shaped into Muslim-Haters (us) vs secular-liberals (them). This new grouping, I believe, instead of shaming people, actually serves to strengthen their beliefs. It reconfirms their suspicions that the secularists ‘hate everything Hindu’. For people like my right-leaning friend, their politics is about taking pride in Hinduism. They truly believe that they don’t hate Muslims, but are being branded so when they attempt to love Hinduism. Are the two mutually not inclusive? The same applies to the other side of the debate – is being a good Muslim not inclusive of respecting other value systems and beliefs? Just like the Quran is often mis-quoted and all Muslims painted in the same broad strokes of being ‘kafir-haters’, are we liberals too falling in the same trap, of painting all those who lean to the right as ‘Muslim haters’? My problem with such a perception is that it stops dialogues. We end up speaking in our own echo chambers the moment we allow such an interpretation and divisions of us vs them. For dialogue to succeed, it has to essentially take into account the various dimensions of how it is being perceived. Social anxiety gets heightened by the news and views that crowds our social media timeline. What I see as blatant lies and propaganda are viewed as gospels of truth by my friend – what is clear and present danger for me is a distant unending cacophony for her. Perhaps even an irritant that only spawns apathy. What I see as hate is perhaps a reaction for her ‘in national interest’. What I see as abetment to hate crimes perhaps has no correlation for her with the present government. The debates can be unending on the merits of such a line of thought, but are we really even having a debate anymore? Or are we in endless loops of our own proclamations and beliefs? There is a new partition between our minds – there is no universal truth when the sanest fall for fake news. When the best of countries are fighting to keep ahead of this ugly mix of technology, religion, politics and economics-driven perceptions, why have higher standards for the common man? If our bid to counter systemic and institutionalized hate politics has resulted in a vehement and moralistic rejection of people based on labels, the chasm is only going to increase. This Independence Day, we need to acknowledge that it is not the majority that hates – it is only a politically driven minority that whips up this hatred, to make it a majoritarian cause and rhetoric. This rhetoric is further perpetuated everyday through both our criticism of it as well as the other side's jingoistic cheer-leading. Instead of knocking down bridges, we need to reopen communication that we all listen to emphatically. For that, we can’t push and label a certain section in a tit-for-tat race. Instead, only make 'other' those who whip up hate – all shades of hate – for a happier and truly inclusive independence.",2018-08-14,"Freedom,Fake news,India at 71,Independence day 2018","A new Independence, and a new partition",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/independence-day-2018-india-freedom-fake-news-hate-crimes-polarisation-minorities/story/1/26064.html
238,Shiv Visvanathan,"Today independence is an idea that makes you nostalgic and bitter. At the very moment you toast to your freedom and salute the national movement, you wonder what we did with that freedom all these years. For me independence meant an unleashing of the imagination, reaching out for a creativity that went far beyond the colonial limits. Maybe three anecdotes could cover what independence meant, the autonomy of thought, the creativity of the mind it entailed. Years ago, an American journalist asked Gandhi, “What do you think of Western civilisation?” Gandhi answered: “It would be a good idea.” Gandhi’s mind was already free long before Independence. The follow-up of this story is a cartoon by that mordant caricaturists and novelist, OV Vijayan. It is a cartoon of an older Gandhi hobbing on a cane and being asked, “What do you think of Indian civilisation and independence?” He said, “That would also be a good idea.” Independence was not the mere ritual of hoisting the flag and going through the rituals of saluting it. Independence was the art of being free, the craft of inventing new possibilities, the ability to create new dreams and live them out. Our national movement had a sense of it. Where else would you find a movement so hospitable to the West, which could welcome the West as part of our freedom movement? I remember philosopher Raimundo Panikkar tell me that independence was not just about liberation from colonialism. Independence was a time when you transcend colonial categories. Panikkar, in fact, proposed that we should not empty out Pondicherry, Serampur but have them as lenses for India to study the West. Independence was that plural time when the soul was open to new ideas. A sense of freedom went with a sense of trusteeship. I guess the first narrowing of independence was when India lost its sense of civilisation and became a nation state. A civilisation was a dream of cosmologies, of alternative worlds, but a nation state was only a policing operation, an obsession with boundaries. Between Partition and the Bengal Famine, India lost its sense of civilisation and became a nation state. Today, the RSS and the BJP has made the idea of independence a mediocre idea by narrowing the idea of patriotism. The RSS had no idea of dream time. I asked a scientist to explain his idea of dream time. He told me that India has over 100,000 varieties of rice, a hundred thousand ways of cooking, sowing and dreaming. He said independence means keeping that diversity alive, the availability of every variety as a dream of an alternative imagination. I remember my father dreamt of independence as a serial drama of other liberations. He felt that the fifties had crippled India. His favourite metaphor was hockey. He talked of the 1936 Olympics where India played against the US. For the first half an hour, we played with canvas shoes and hardly made a dent. Come half time, we threw away the shoes and beat the US 21-0. But the West introduced AstroTurf which destroyed our game. You could not play barefoot on Astro-Turf. For my father, independence was hockey without Astro-Turf. Independence to us was not just creativity, but the right to make rules. The West, he felt, had been a rule-maker for too long. My father felt that independence meant outthinking the West or any other colonial power and its right to determine our future. I remember talking to an anthropologist and Gandhian. He said the West had destroyed forest and tribals within it. The genocide of tribes and their virtual extinction was one of the great crimes of the West. The old man added independence means not following the West in destroying the tribes, but a ritual act of sharing freedom. The tribe to be free has to be both a parallel and complementary world. Independence for him was the sense of freeing yourself from a totalitarian impetus. It is this cascading sense of creating other freedoms that we have lost. Independence is gifting freedom to other worlds and other lives. I remember historian Dharampal talking about freedom in the 17th and 18th century. Dharampal claimed that if a king was tyrannical, the villagers would abandon the village en masse. The king had to run behind them and apologise for them to return. Independence, to Dharampal, was the right to secede from any form of tyranny. Secession, in fact, becomes the first right of independent citizenship. Independence, to my friend UR Ananthamurthy, meant the right to your own story and the storyteller. It is the right to relate to your world in the language of your choice. Ananthamurthy added, “Illiterate India was free. An illiterate worker spoke in six languages while a convent schoolgirl barely communicated in one.” Independence to Ananthamurthy was the right to articulate your world in your own language. He always felt Macaulay robbed us of our freedom more than Clive or Cornwallis did. Independence for the many teachers who taught me was a state of mind free from the mind of state. Independence was a state without emergencies, where the poor were not criminalised for their poverty. What haunts India is the fact that we have corroded our independence by destroying the freedom of the margins through development, the freedom to migrate through mob lynchings, the freedom to pursue another religion through riots. Independence is the right to dissent. Independence is not independence without alternatives. I must give the last word to a group of Kashmiri students. Independence is freedom from torture and rape, the right not to be brutalised because you left your ID card at home. Independence is the right to move and think freely without surveillance, sentencing or threats. Independence, they sadly feel, has not reached all parts of India. Independence in that sense is a utopia we seek to build every day, a freedom invented every moment, the right to be and the right for others to be. It is a dream and a hypothesis that has to be confirmed again and again. It is a salute to the human in all of us.

239,Sumana Roy,"That ‘independence’ had anything to do with anything or anyone except ‘India’ was a secret kept away from me for a long part of my early childhood. The sounds of the two words, a proper noun, the other an abstract noun, had become fused in my consciousness: India and independence. Both didn’t matter very much to me — these were things for adults, both India and independence, almost as necessary to them as salaries and postal addresses. Then the word became sterile — exaggeratedly yellow laddoos annotated with green boondis, a limp flag on a wet August morning, my mother’s starched Ganga-Yamuna saree, meant to mimic the Indian tricolour but oddly comic and graceful in its failed imitation, a neighbourhood uncle’s bad joke about Rabindranath having actually written the refrain of ‘Jaya he’ for Amitabh Bachchan, and soon enough, brittle excuses for not going to school on the day. By that time I’d discovered who I really was — a child. And I immediately wanted to be rid of that identity — that would be independence for me, to become an adult. Among all things I know, including the real wait for death or the metaphorical wait for love (for even when there’s a lover, one has the sense of not really having their love), the wait for adulthood is the longest — it is because one doesn’t really know when one has, almost magically, turned into an adult. It’s not like a bud blooming into a flower, of course. It’s been nearly 25 years since I officially became an adult, but I often have to remind myself of that; others have to remind me, too. In these 25 years, I’ve noticed only one thing about independence. That one never finds it. The myth of Sisyphus must derive from this, or the thing about horizons, that one never reaches it because it is constantly moving away. In the last two years of school, in a hostel in Calcutta, my friends and I found independence in the unlikeliest things — summer and winter vacations that allowed us to be at home, a brief and unremarkable outing to New Market, not so much to buy anything as taste the air of freedom, of contact with strangers, both bodily and visual, or to the Sunday service at St James Church next door, when my friends sometimes wore lipstick for the boys who sang in the choir. This should have educated me — that the experience of freedom would always be fleeting. But desire can’t be educated, and hence the longing for a permanent kind of independence. I don’t know of anyone who can claim to have experienced independence fully and completely. Religion — and the spiritual experience — has legitimised the desire for independence from everything, including the world and worldliness, in the statement of its ambition, of its ultimate end, as in moksha or nirvana. Art has its near-equivalent categories – one most often employed as slightly harsh critique, is ‘escapism’. In both, nirvana and escapism, the human is seeking independence from the world, from the social, from what is colloquially called ‘reality’ (‘The world is too much with us’ is a slogan for the desire for this kind of independence). There is no one I know who doesn’t have a private metaphor for independence. In this inventory, the most common one I’ve encountered is that of a bird — the freedom from gravity seems to be the ultimate form of independence. Having encountered it in song after song, from all kinds of singing traditions, I asked this to a Baul singer singing about the   on a train to Santiniketan — but how does the bird imagine independence? I have come to realise that the concept of independence is terribly anthropomorphic. The idea of Independence Day has always seemed hilarious to me — it’s like the birth of a child suddenly turning two people into parents. Can independence ever come like that? I watch a gymnast twirl in the air before landing on the floor and I wonder whether she’s experienced a moment of freedom. The next moment, because my heartbeat had quickened, I speculate whether hers had, too. And then I indulge in simple mathematics – that freedom is undoubtedly accompanied and annotated by anxiety. It is an anxiety that we welcome as necessary, as necessary as saliva is to our pleasure in eating, much as it might seem like an encumbrance. Inside me – and all around me – is an invisible prayer and desire for everyone’s independence, all of us who are in various kinds of bondage, even the luxurious ones we can’t always see, say, as of capitalism. But, increasingly, I find myself thinking of the independence of the non-human – plants and trees, and animals and even things. What a joyous world it might be if these beings were to become independent of human control. What is the opposite – or obverse – of independence? It is not dependence, I am certain. Whatever it is, it, too, is a human invention, I think. Independence is a human construct, a desire of the human imagination. We desire it only because we don’t have it. I wonder whether astronauts who have walked in space have felt the same way about independence as those tied by gravity. Just as imagination needs the human mind, independence needs a substratum. To restrict it to the celebration of what is essentially a political event — the handing of power back to Indians by the British — is to indulge in a myopic understanding of independence.  ",2018-08-14,"Freedom,India at 71,72nd independence day,Independence day 2018",India at 71: The well-kept secret about independence,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/independence-day-august-15-india-at-71-tricolour-freedom/story/1/26060.html
240,Manoj Joshi,"The ISIS may have been defeated in Syria and in retreat elsewhere, but there is serious danger that it could expand its activities in South East Asia. The region is home to 40 per cent of the Muslims in the world, with majorities in Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, and significant pockets in Thailand, Myanmar and the Philippines and there are hundreds of erstwhile IS fighters who have returned to the region after the outfit’s defeat in Syria. South East Asia was once known for its moderate brand of Islam and its secularist politics. But this is now under severe stress. Most western analysts think that the IS is essentially finished. But security forces in South East Asia feel that they may have entered into a new phase of expansion in their region which has had pockets of Islamic extremism going back decades. There have been a slew of terrorist incidents across the region for the past two decades, but the most serious incident since the Bali bombing of 2002 was the occupation of Marawi city in Mindanao island of the Philippines in May 2017 by three jihadist groups that included the IS. The ensuing battle lasting five months led to the town being razed and the deaths of a thousand people. More recently, in May 2018, three churches were bombed in Surabaya, Indonesia’s second largest city. The fourth bombing happened when the terrorists accidentally detonated bombs in their own apartment killing three of them and the fifth happened outside the police headquarters when the bombers were being searched at its entrance. These attacks have been attributed to the Jamaah Andharut Daulah (JAD), a local affiliate of the IS, and has featured the use of difficult-to-detect family cells. In June this year, a five-judge bench sentenced radical cleric Aman Abdurraham to death for his role in inciting terrorist attacks in Indonesia. He is considered to be the leader of the JAD and has been operating from jail since 2010 when he was imprisoned for running a paramilitary training camp in Aceh for the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist network. The JI was the one behind the Bali bombing that killed 202 people. Since then, he had inspired several attacks especially those targeting Christians. On Friday, Philippine defense secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that a Moroccon terrorist allied to the Abu Sayyaf group, linked to the IS, was most likely behind a suicide bomb attack that killed 11 persons, including five militiamen at a military checkpoint. Governments of the region, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia, have been trying to ride the Islamist tiger by pandering to the orthodox Islamic parties. In Malaysia, the Parti Islam Se Malaysia is the main Islamist party and the Barisan Nasional coalition, that ruled Malaysia for over six decades till its shock defeat in May, believes they would have fared much better, had they collaborated with the PIS. In Indonesia, the main Islamist political formation is the Prosperous Justice Party, though it is the Front Pembela Islam, a vigilante group that is responsible for the violent promotion of Islamic causes. Last week, as a matter of abundant caution, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, who again confronts the establishment candidate Subianto Prabowo, has decided to draft Maruf Amin, the 75-year-old head of the Majlis Ulema Indonesia (MUI or Indonesian Ulema Council) as his running mate. In 2016, the orthodoxy demonstrated its strength in Indonesia when it targeted Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the then governor of Jakarta who went by the nickname Ahok. A Christian of Chinese origin, he was accused of blasphemy and is currently serving a two-year sentence in jail after being convicted on that charge. In Indonesia, Islamist parties like PJP and the FPI target Christians, Chinese and other minorities and the attack on Ahok who was an ally of Joko Widodo was a manifestation of a trend. The success of this attack was a signal to the Opposition to hop on to the Islamic bandwagon, and to prevent being outflanked, Widodo has taken the step of allying himself with the custodian of the orthodoxy — the MUI. India is more familiar with the Rohingya issue, which arises out of the crisis created in Myanmar when Muslim militants attacked Buddhist communities and triggered a backlash that has seen hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas expelled from the Rakhine province on Myanmar to Bangladesh. The plight of the Rohingyas has led to groups like the al Qaeda and the IS and other jihadist groups to call for attacks on Myanmar and its leaders. Preventing further spread of violent religious extremism is the most important task before the governments of the region. But as the siege of Marawi indicated, the challenge is not merely one of prevention, but of an active counter-terrorism policy to eradicate the threat of jihadism to the region.

241,Adil Hossain,"Acclaimed historian Ayesha Jalal in her book,  , argues that due to the huge socio-economic inequalities and inherited unresponsive colonial bureaucracy, non-elected institutions triumphs over the elected power centres for most citizens in South Asia. Elections are thus treated like rituals and they only put together elements of ""formal democracy and covert authoritarianism"". The arrest of eminent Bangladeshi photographer Shahidul Alam on August 5 by 25 detective branch officers in Dhaka has brought this tension between the ideals of democratic functioning and the authoritarian intent of the Sheikh Hasina government to the forefront. However, in this case the covert has become overt. The recent wave of protests in Bangladesh started with the   by a privately operated speeding bus on the roads of Dhaka on July 29. Immediately, a large-scale student movement for road safety began in the Bangladesh capital and soon spread to other cities in the country with a charter of nine demands. Road collision and resultant deaths are not uncommon in South Asian countries, including Bangladesh. But surprisingly, even a seemingly apolitical demand of road safety from students has sent the Hasina government in a tizzy in a country where, according to the World Health Organisation, 20,000 fatal road accidents happen every year. In the initial days of the protest, despite government warning, students in their school uniforms raised checkpoints and started to inspect driving licences of all drivers and riders. They also ensured vehicles stuck to their respective emergency lanes. It irked many officials in the country but protesters received widespread praise from many citizens for their peaceful movement demanding safe roads. A    , ""At this moment, we are witnessing something unprecedented in the history of our transport and infrastructure: Our roads are starting to function in a proper and efficient manner… And the credit for this goes to all the students"". The Hasina government was in no mood to give in to the demands of the teenage protesters and initiated a brutal crackdown not only by police officials but also by the armed student wing of the ruling party. The attack on students and videos of armed men brutally thrashing photojournalists went viral on social media and received condemnation worldwide, including a United Nations statement condemning the crackdown. It is at this juncture that prominent photojournalist Shahidul Alam gave an interview to Al-Jazeera and exposed the larger dimensions of the protest to the world media. He   by the police hours after the interview was broadcast. The next day, Alam was charged under Section 57 of the Bangladesh's Information Commission Technology Act, a draconian law through which the government has threatened many other human rights defenders, bloggers, and media representatives for criticising authorities in the past. Many believe it was only because the case was in the limelight that Alam was produced before a court else many other activists and political opponents are known to have become victims of  . Why did the Bangladeshi government come down so heavily on Alam? One obvious reason is that the government wants to send out a message to the urban elite to remain silent on the functioning of the government. But according to some  , Alam's main offence was that he exposed the diminished credibility of the Hasina government in front of the world media. When the interviewer in Al-Jazeera asked him if the protests are only about road safety, Alam said that demonstrators are motivated by larger factors and not the demand for safer roads alone. He pointed to ""the looting of the banks and the gag on the media"", widespread ""extrajudicial killings, disappearances, bribery and corruption"" as the main reasons for the growing public anger and disillusionment with the Hasina government. Alam told the interviewer that the present government ""lacks the mandate to rule"" as most of the MPs of the ruling Awami League were elected unopposed because opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) refused to take part in the 2014 elections and therefore the government ""has been clinging to power by brute force"". He expressed apprehensions of a possible rigging in the upcoming general election, a fear many Bangladeshi citizens cannot express in public. He said, ""They know that if there is a fair and free election, they will lose. But they haven't got an exit plan [and] as they have misruled for so long so that if they do lose, they will be torn apart. So, they have to hang on by any means so that is exactly what they are doing. They are clinging on using the entire might of the system plus the armed goons at their disposal."" Awami League, a 'secular' political party in a Muslim majority country with friendly ties with India and strong backing of other western governments in the aftermath of the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar and goodwill gestures showed by Hasina government has little to fear from outside world in the form of sanctions or other punitive measures. BNP with its ties to Jamat, the party allegedly responsible for the 1971 genocide remains a second choice for many people who are worried about an Islamist takeover of the country. But the Hasina government seems to have crossed the line this time and people are accusing her of misusing institutions and weakening democracy. The arrest of Alam and crackdown on student protesters have exposed the authoritarian streak in Awami League leaders. The party must know that a rule by force cannot go on forever. Everything has an expiry date and in case of authoritarian governments the end can come sooner than expected as pages of history tell us.",2018-08-12,"Shahidul alam,Bangladesh student protest,Student protests,Sheikh Hasina","Students, photographers, civil society under arrest - The chaos that is becoming Bangladesh",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bangladesh-student-protest-student-protests-sheikh-hasina-shahidul-alam-road-accidents-in-bangladesh-world-health-organisation/story/1/26025.html
242,Yaqoob ul Hassan,"Pakistan general elections held on July 25 were hugely disputed. Except for the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), all other parties rejected the election results alleging that polls were marred by both pre-poll engineering and post-poll rigging. Certain steps taken by the Pakistani military establishment vitiated the atmosphere even before polling was held. A media gag and judicial compromise were used against the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz). The Army ensured that both Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Maryam, remain out of power corridors, even if PMLN comes to power with a fractured mandate. It is thus clear that PMLN and other parties did not get a level playing field to contest the elections.  included the PTI forging new alliances such as a tie-up with the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) in Sindh and Baluchistan Awami Party (BAP) in Baluchistan. Also, religious parties such as Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) and Milli Muslim League (MML) were propped up to divide the vote bank. Nevertheless, Pakistan saw its second consecutive democratic transition of power. People did come out to vote amid a pro-Imran Khan wave in the country. Khan, on his part, did manage to create a narrative against corruption. He promised a welfare state, lower taxes and pro-people government. By winning a majority of the seats, the PTI led by the ex-cricketer is set to form a government on August 18, as Khan takes oath of office. But the support of regional parties that has ensured Khan becomes Prime Minister will always keep the PTI on the edge. The PTI government led by Khan will face a daunting task of delivering what he promised during elections and his conciliatory speech after winning a majority of the National Assembly seats. Pakistan's economy is in deep trouble. Khan has grudgingly acknowledged that the new government needs to seek external help to maintain the foreign exchange reserves. Pakistan's   in 2017-18 from $32.5 billion in 2016-17. It is likely to go further up in the next fiscal year. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, the deficit will reach $45 billion in the fiscal year 2022-23. This fiscal imbalance has more to do with the higher import bills. Over the years Pakistan imported a lot, including small machinery products for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In the past, the PTI has lambasted the previous governments for relying on external donors, especially going to IMF every now and then. However, the PTI has no choice but to go to the IMF itself. But before it could approach the IMF, US secretary of state   that any potential IMF bailout for Pakistan's new government should not provide funds to pay off Chinese lenders. The US' position on IMF loan for Pakistan needs to be seen in the larger geopolitical context and the great power tussle going on in the region. The PTI's election promise to cut taxes will only further burden the flagging economy. The party's 90-day plan to put the economy on track is going to be a daunting task. The Saudi-backed Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) has agreed to  . But there are no free lunches in international relations. These loans will come with some policy implications for the PTI government. The loan will not allow Khan to take decisions freely with regards to Iran. Pakistan has achieved some tactical success against terrorism within the country with 2018 seeing the lowest number of terror-related incidents and casualties. But   claimed by both Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and The Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP), is a grim reminder that terrorists still have the potential to hit at will. The much-hyped   that was framed by the last government after the Army Public School attack has only been partially implemented. The last government did try to ban, albeit selectively, some sectarian outfits and few were put under the fourth schedule of the anti-terrorism act. But representatives of most of these organisations have been freed and allowed to contest elections. Will Imran Khan's government take on these outfits and implement NAP in its true spirit? One will have to wait and watch and see how Khan tackles the internal security challenge. Imran Khan's biggest challenge will come in the form of managing and framing foreign policy. Traditionally, it has been seen that in Pakistan it is the army that controls foreign policy. In his  , Khan said he wanted to have good relations with Afghanistan and India. He wanted to turn Pakistan into a transit trade hub and reap the benefits of the geography but the question is will the army allow him to do that? 
 
 His foremost challenge would come in the form of how he manages its relations with the army. Without getting the army on his side - and that looks impossible - it is unlikely for Khan to ensure Islamabad does not create trouble in Afghanistan. With India, he has to walk on a tightrope. He would be cautioned by the army to walk slowly in mending fences with India. Even though Khan may have good intention vis-à-vis India, he will be faced with the tough task of getting the army to agree. The other main foreign policy challenge would be to maintain neutrality in the Middle East. In the past, PTI has been seen as the party that wants to have good relations with Iran. It wants to enhance trade and diplomatic relations with Tehran but its biggest challenge would be how it manages relations with Saudi Arabia and its allies in the region. Pakistan's Tehran policy had always been seen through the prism of its relations with Saudi Arabia. The country maintained minimum relations with Iran so that the Saudis are not antagonised. The US-Pakistan relations have nosedived in the recent past. The PTI and Khan have been highly critical of the US and its Afghan war. In the past, Khan has vehemently opposed the US drone strikes in the FATA area of Pakistan. With Donald Trump administration's aggressive approach towards Pakistan, Khan will find it relatively easier to justify his rhetoric. The issue would be with the army. The Pakistan army would still like to maintain a decent relationship with the US. Trump would like Khan to bring Taliban on the table by putting pressure on them. For that to happen, Khan needs to bring a paradigmatic shift in Pakistan's foreign policy. But it is easier said than done.",2018-08-12,"Pakistan prime minister,Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf,Pakistan general elections,Imran Khan",Why ruling Pakistan is going to be fraught with challenges for Imran Khan,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/imran-khan-pakistan-general-elections-pakistan-tehreek-e-insaf-pakistan-prime-minister-pakistan-economy-terror-financing-imf/story/1/26024.html
243,Amitabh Srivastava,"The narrow lane in Muzaffarpur Kalyaani locality called Sahu Gali ends almost abruptly at Brajesh Thakur’s four-storied house. One can’t go beyond his house on the lane, and so it was akin to a jail for the girls in the shelter home. The iron gate leading to the compound is locked. A board announces it as the office of  , the newspaper Thakur owns. A few feet to the right, a small part of the wall announces this was a shelter for girls in need of protection, with the Bihar government’s official emblem on top. The painted signboard has Bihar Sarkar written on top and Sewa Sankalp, the organisation that ran it, at the bottom. The third floor, where the girls who were beaten, drugged and raped were kept, has two sections. The first had 40 beds while the second had 10 beds. A flight of stairs leads to the ‘torture room’ on the fourth floor. The Balika Grih run by Thakur, which is at the heart of the shelter home sexual abuse horror, was paid Rs 40 lakh a year by the social welfare department. Thakur is the prime accused in the case, in which at least 34 minor girls were raped and tortured. Most of the victims are orphans and homeless, which made them both vulnerable and unfortunate. They had no families to turn to. Ideally, the state should have taken over their guardianship. In this case, however, the state government outsourced the job to an NGO with questionable credentials. Their rape and sexual abuse continued for months as those assigned to monitor the shelter homes looked the other way. Last week, chief minister Nitish Kumar also agreed that it was a system failure that caused sexual abuse in the shelter homes. Indeed, the system of surveillance and checks was compromised for successive months at every level. The rules stipulate that every shelter home must be examined and approved by a district screening committee before it can be allowed to house girls. But, the rules were turned upside down in the case of Thakur’s Seva Sankalp Evam Vikas Samiti that ran the state government-funded shelter. Here, the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights and District Magistrate, Muzaffarpur, had written to State Welfare Department to shift the shelter. The officials in the social welfare department opted to ignore it. Even the chairman of the child protection commission, Harpal Kaur, who visited the Bal Grih and submitted a report saying the girls were “sad” failed to pick the telltale signs of sexual abuse. In the case of Muzaffarpur short stay home, Dilip Verma and Vikash Kumar, chairman and member of the district child welfare committee have also been found to be involved in the sexual exploitation of girls. With the CBI taking over the investigations, there’s hope for all culprits to be exposed.

244,Dev Ankur Wadhawan,"The BJP in Rajasthan seems to have pressed the panic button. Unable to achieve much in terms of development, it has apparently decided to polarise voters, trying to divide them along communal lines.  And in this bid, it has decided to  , from their current “Muslim-sounding” names to more “Hindu-sounding” ones. As if that can bring respite to the miseries of the common man, and make them forget all that this government promised and has been unable to achieve in its rule of more than four-and-a-half years! The move was formally adopted after the state government received clearance from the Union home ministry. So now, Ismailpur in Jhunjhunu district becomes Pichanwa Khurd, Narpura is the new name for Narpada in Jalore district, and Miyan Ka Bara in Barmer has been renamed Mahesh Nagar.  The central government has begun the process of changing the names of around 15 villages on the basis of recommendations made by the state government’s revenue department, which has issued a gazette notification on the change. According to the Rajasthan government, the names are being changed on the basis recommendations made at the Panchayat level. Several villagers have claimed that their demand for the name change has been long-standing, but is being paid heed to only now. The process of formalising the name change at the ground level has already begun. The signboards pertaining to Miyan Ka Bada are being removed, and replaced with that of Mahesh Nagar. State revenue minister Amra Ram said: “There are three Muslim families in Miyan Ka Bada. In this scenario, why should its name be ‘Miyan Ka Bara’? We have gone in for the name change only after going through a proper process.” The Congress in Rajasthan has accused the BJP of using the measure as a diversionary tactic in a bid to polarise voters ahead of the elections. “The BJP always divides people to extract political benefit,” said Sachin Pilot, Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee chief.  Rajasthan is set to witness Assembly elections this year, where much is at stake for both the BJP and the Congress. The BJP has been trying hard to communicate its “achievements” to the people on the ground. Party chief Amit Shah himself   the BJP’s ‘Gaurav Yatra’ in the state, with a massive rally held with CM Vasundhara Raje in Rajsamand district on August 4. The Congress, on the other hand, will have party president Rahul Gandhi in the state on August 11, in a bid to give a boost to its poll campaign.   The move to go in for the name changes comes at a time when Raje, perceived to have become unpopular, is helming the party during a crucial election year.  The party is also battling massive anti-incumbency, manifest in the   Lok Sabha and Assembly by-polls held earlier this year.  Consider this: The BJP’s candidate from Ajmer constituency lost to the Congress’s candidate by more than 84,000 votes. It is a seat the BJP had won by more than 1.70 lakh votes in 2014 Lok Sabha polls, as Sachin Pilot suffered a humiliating defeat.  In Alwar, the ruling party’s candidate lost by a margin of more than 1.96 lakh votes. It is a seat the BJP had won by close to 2.84 lakh votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. In Mandalgarh Assembly by-poll, the Congress candidate defeated the BJP’s by more than 12,000 votes. That in a seat where the Congress was in a tight spot, as a party leader decided to contest as an Independent and cut into its votes. Whether the decision to change the names of villages helps the BJP electorally by consolidating Hindu votes is something only time can tell. But the move is clearly fraught with the possibility of further dividing the masses along communal lines, in an already vitiated atmosphere.",2018-08-10,"BJP,Muslims,Vasundhara Raje,Rajasthan Assembly polls",Rajasthan: Will changing 'Muslim names' of villages help BJP consolidate Hindu votes?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/vasundhara-raje-muslim-villages-name-change-rajasthan-assembly-elections/story/1/25990.html
246,Romita Datta,"The Opposition's choice for the prime ministerial candidate is beginning to narrow down. The buzz is to project an 'Iron Lady' like Indira Gandhi as the candidate for the position of head of the nation this time. Recently Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and Lalu Yadav's son Tejashwi Yadav had  that Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati could be considered for the top job. While the candidature of the two women leaders, who have proved their mettle in the world of politics, was still a matter of conjecture, Janata Dal (Secular) supremo HD Deve Gowda cleared the air and zeroed in on two names from his side — Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and BSP supremo Mayawati. Asked about chances of Mamata becoming a Prime Minister,  : ""Most welcome if Mamata is projected as PM. Indira Gandhi ruled for 17 years. Why should we (men) alone become PM? Why not Mamata or Mayawati? No politician from the Opposition camp has so far expressed any reservations about the proposal. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, Sharad Pawar, who is also seen as a prime ministerial candidate, on his part, said that senior leaders like Sonia Gandhi, Deve Gowda and he himself, who have no prime ministerial ambitions, should concentrate on consolidating the Opposition camp to take on the BJP in the 2019 general elections. The statements have come as music to the ears of Banerjee and her supporters in Bengal. Didi's road to Delhi appears to be more or less hurdle-free, in case there is no major rainfall of fortune for the Congress. In West Bengal too, there is growing enthusiasm over the prospect of having a Bengali Prime Minister. The state missed out on the opportunity when in 1996 Jyoti Basu was not allowed to take up the job by the party's highest decision-making body — Politburo. Basu later regretted called the decision a ""historic blunder"". ""Bengal won't commit another historic blunder and we have to make sure that another Bengali makes it this time,"" said a Trinamool Congress MP, on the condition of anonymity. Efforts are already on to consolidate votes in the state by drumming up support for a Bengali for the plum post. Be it political rallies, processions or government programmes, there is just one theme underlining it all - ""It's time people of India got a leader like Mamata Banerjee."" At a recent rally in Midnapore, held to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi's political programme in the state, all Trinamool Congress leaders stressed the need to replace Modi with Banerjee, ""who worked for all"" and was ""humane in her approach"". While Banerjee's trusted lieutenants gushed over her achievements and said that she was actually capable of ushering in good times, as opposed to Modi's promise of 'achhe din', they were quick to add that Banerjee has no lust for power. But Banerjee's love for positions of power from where she can command and control is well known. However, she is in no hurry to lift her veil. On the question of Prime Minister's chair, she'll go by the Lucknowi tehzeeb of ""pehele aap"". The West Bengal chief minister recently said she would be happy to work like a squirrel that goes about doing its work quietly, without really bothering about its reward. It is likely that she will wait till results are out to stake claim to the prime minister's chair. Even when the Congress president   that his party will have no problem in accepting anybody as Prime Minister provided the person is non-BJP and non-RSS, Banerjee stressed on collective leadership. Quoting Rabindranath Tagore, she said, ""We are all Kings in the kingdom of our King."" But how this 'group of kings' will rule the kingdom is a big question. Banerjee has been repeatedly saying that Bengal will lead the country. That is the closest she has come to talking about her hidden ambitions. If her party manages to win all 42 Lok Sabha seats from West Bengal, Banerjee's candidature for the position would get stronger. Support for her candidature is also being pushed through Facebook pages. The cry for a Bengali PM is likely to gain a lot of traction because the state has since long been complaining about step-motherly treatment. Banerjee's stand on the National Register of Citizens and her statement that Bengalis are being driven out of Assam is already paying political dividends and is out to browbeat BJP's attempt at Hindu polarisation in Bengal. Amid all this, the clarion call for a Bengali PM may just prove to be Banerjee's ultimate masterstroke.",2018-08-08,"Mayawati,Deve Gowda,2019 general elections,Mamata Banerjee",How pitch for a Bengali Prime Minister may propel Mamata Banerjee to the top chair,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mamata-banerjee-2019-general-elections-deve-gowda-mayawati-opposition-unity-sonia-gandhi/story/1/25948.html

248,Rahul Shrivastava,"The election for the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman’s post is going to be a BJP versus Congress battle — the first war for numbers in the Upper House between the big two since 2014. At the end of nearly two months of discussions on a joint candidate, regional parties working with the Congress finally decided they did not wish to put up a contestant. The Congress, thus, has been forced to field party veteran from Karnataka, BK Hariprasad, to take on the NDA’s Harivansh Narayan Singh.  On record, the BJP’s parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar maintained, “We want a consensus on the name of Harivansh Narayan Singh of the JD(U), and for that, we are speaking to all political parties.”  Behind the scenes, the BJP is making feverish efforts to stitch together the numbers to ensure a win for Harivansh. Picking a JD (U) man for Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu’s deputy in the Upper House is a deft political move.  So complex is the numerical game and so delicate the political alignments that a party like the BJD, with nine members, holds the key to the contest. Sources say the BJP has zeroed in on a JD(U) man with a strategy in mind. One, it deepens its ties with the party. Second, it is using the good offices of Nitish Kumar, the Bihar CM, to win over non-NDA and non-UPA players like the BJD. Initially, the signal from the Odisha party was that it would remain equidistant from the Congress and the BJP (by abstaining from voting). The buzz now is that with Nitish Kumar’s nudge, the BJP may even support the NDA pick. This has impacted the Opposition strategy. With the BJD’s support unlikely, the Congress’s allies have lost the appetite to field a candidate to be backed by the UPA. But it’s still not all smooth sailing for the BJP. It is now the largest party in the Rajya Sabha, but there is no guarantee it can gain control of the seat of deputy chairman. The Opposition is all set to give a tough fight, use the election to underline where each party stands. A senior RJD leader, part of the Opposition’s efforts to put up a joint candidate to challenge the BJP, said, “This is an election year. The BJP’s rivals can’t let it score an easy win at any level.”  After party candidate Hariprasad filed his nomination, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said, “This is our collective expression to convey to the people that the Opposition stands together on certain fundamental issues. The government never made an effort to reach out to the Opposition. It didn’t show the courtesy to consult the senior leaders. It just announced its decision to field a candidate.” The election is on August 9. After it failed to dent the government’s numerical might during the No Confidence Motion in the Lower House, the Opposition is all geared up for this battle. The term of the last Rajya Sabha deputy chairman, PJ Kurien, ended on June 30. In the first week of July, the Opposition made all the right noises, and it seemed that despite having the largest number of MPs, the BJP faced the prospect of losing. This would have seriously undermined the NDA government’s capability to push through critical legislation in its last year in power, despite having two former BJP leaders chairing the two Houses.  The Opposition had done its math and was holding parleys to build a consensus. Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, was steering the effort.  Initially, there were signals that the candidate may be from a regional party, perhaps the Trinamool Congress, with the backing of the entire Opposition. TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu and many other regional satraps were said to be working the phone lines to ensure that those opposed to the BJP backed the Opposition pick.  But non-aligned groups in the Rajya Sabha, such as the AIADMK, the TRS, the BJD and others, became stumbling blocks.  During the past two days, the Congress and its allies met several times. A consensus seemed to be building, but by the evening of August 7, chances of a Congress ally being fielded dimmed.  A senior Congress leader said, “After a lot of deliberations, the name of Vandana Chavan of the NCP was under active consideration.  But after consultations, and failing to get the BJD on board, the NCP pulled out of the contest.”  The Congress went into a huddle and decided that it did not want the NDA to “score an easy win”. Party sources said that the Congress didn’t want to let a NDA man get elected unopposed, and hence fielded BK Hariprasad. If it wins, the BJP will showcase the victory as “triumph over a united Opposition.” Both the formations are eyeing the votes of the fence sitters. There can be multiple scenarios: With allies, Independents and the AIADMK’s 13 members, the BJP is certain of 109 votes, while 123 votes are required to win.   To keep the NDA flock together, BJP chief Amit Shah had sent feelers to Uddhav Thackeray, and conveyed that as a goodwill gesture, the post of deputy chairman would be offered to a candidate from the alliance.  The Opposition, on the other hand, was trying to split the NDA ranks, especially where the fissures are wide and visible. TDP sources say that Chandrababu Naidu had spoken to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for support.  For now, the BJP has been able to win over its allies like the Shiv Sena, which had abstained during the No Confidence voting, and the Akali Dal, which was grumbling till the day before as its opinion was not taken by the BJP before picking Harivansh. Akali Dal had been eyeing the berth for its own party, as it is now the BJP’s oldest and motst reliable ally.  The TRS has been inching closer to the BJP, with party chief K Chandrashekhar Rao meeting PM Narendra Modi last week (second meeting in 50 days). Sources say TMC leader Derek O’Brien too was in touch with Rao, the TRS chief, in an attempt to to keep him on the same side as the TDP (the creation of Telangana is still an issue in Andhra Pradesh, the residual state ruled by the TDP). But Rao had sent a different signal by skipping the mega unity show at the Congress-JDS swearing-in ceremony in Karnataka, as he did not want to share stage with the Congress. YSR Congress leader Jaganmohan Reddy is TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu’s bete noir in Andhra Pradesh, and ideally would oppose his efforts. If he backs the BJP, in the deputy chairman election, the TDP will brand it as the BJP’s ‘B team’, which may hurt its minority vote in Andhra Pradesh.  Without the three fence-sitters, the Opposition has 118 votes. It needs just five more to beat the BJP, while the ruling party needs 14 more votes from its current strength on paper.  If the BJD, like in the recent No Confidence Motion, abstains, the strength of the House will be down by nine to 235, and the half-way mark will shrink, to the advantage of the Opposition.  If the BJD, the TRS with 6 seats, and the YSR Congress with two seats back the Opposition, then the total against the BJP would swell to 135.  A loss in the poll will be a setback for the BJP.

249,Hamid Mir,"“Do you remember how I made my political party and do you remember the days of my struggle?” Imran Khan posed this question to me at the start of a recent meeting which took place days after his victory in the general elections 2018 of Pakistan. It was not a formal interview. It was just a coffee meeting in his Bani Gala office where a big change was visible a few days before Imran Khan takes oath as Prime Minister. I was asked to deposit my mobile phone at the entrance of his office. This had never happened in the last two decades. I suddenly realised — Ohh, I am going to meet the new Prime Minister of Pakistan. Before meeting Imran Khan, I saw the former CM of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pervez Khattak, his old comrades Dr Arif Alvi and Muneeza Hasan, sitting in a nicely decorated waiting room, next to the office of Imran Khan. This will become the   of the new Prime Minister on weekends because Imran Khan will not spend his weekends in the official residence of the Prime Minister. Imran Khan met me with a tension-free face now. He was mentioning the big challenges waiting for him, with a smile on his face. This time, he was not talking against Nawaz Sharif or Asif Zardari. He was talking about the energy crisis, water shortage and debt problem. When I said, problems are big and opposition in Parliament is also very big, he said, “Many people used to say Imran Khan cannot become Prime Minister. Now the same people are saying Imran Khan cannot resolve our problems – but wait and see. I will defeat these problems.” Imran Khan was very much aware that he may face some difficulties in the upcoming elections of Speaker and Deputy of the National Assembly. The election of Prime Minister will be open but the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker will be held through  .  He was confident that he will easily win the Speaker election. He then surprised me by saying that he is ready to meet Baloch leader Akhtar Mengal and he will support his six  . The first demand of the Balochistan National Party (BNP) head is about missing persons. Mengal is demanding that all missing persons be produced in a court of law. He has only three seats in the National Assembly but Imran Khan was not supporting his six demands just for three votes.  He said, “I supported six points of Akhtar Mengal in 2012 and I will try to address his six demands in 2018 as Prime Minister because I see nothing wrong in his demands.” Akhtar Mengal is one of those openly talking about pre-poll and after-poll rigging in the 2018 election. He is an old critic of the powerful military establishment. Imran Khan can become Prime Minister without his three votes – but his engagement with the BNP is a message for all those who think that he is a puppet of powerful forces who never wanted to see people like Akhtar Mengal in Parliament.  Imran Khan is committed to resolving the issue of missing persons with the help of the Army and all the concerned state institutions. It was Imran Khan who first broke the disappearance story of Dr Afia Siddiqui from Karachi in my TV show   on Geo News in 2003. Then-Interior Minister Faisal Saleh Hayat was present on the show. Dr Afia is now spending her life in a US prison and Imran Khan cannot afford to remain silent about her. The issue of missing persons was directly linked with the war against terrorism.  A large number of people were picked up by security agencies for their alleged links with militants — Imran Khan was one of those who were loudly saying then, “It is not our war, it is America’s war, we should not fight with our own people, and we should produce all disappeared persons in the courts of law”.  Many critics declared him 'Taliban Khan'.  On one of my shows in 2005, the Information Minister of Pervez Musharraf's regime, Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, declared Imran, “Do takey ka kaptan” (two-penny captain) to his face — today, the same Sheikh is an ally of Imran Khan, along with many others who used to make fun of a cricketer who was trying to become Prime Minister of Pakistan, in the presence of many feudals and industrialists. Nobody can deny the fact that Imran Khan struggled hard and never opted for short cuts. He was   by the late General Zia ul Haq in 1988 after the dismissal of Muhammad Khan Juneju’s government. Imran refused. He was again offered a ministry in the caretaker government of Moeen Qureshi in 1993, but he refused.  He established his political party in 1996. I was one of those who never endorsed his idea of joining politics at that time. I was more concerned about his cancer hospital which was inaugurated in 1994 and needed much attention from Imran. Nawaz Sharif offered him an alliance in the 1997 election with 20 National Assembly seats, but he refused. He contested his first election in 1997 and lost badly everywhere. Just a few days before the 2002 election, General Pervez Musharraf forced him towards making an alliance with PML-Q – but Imran refused. Then-ISI DG Gen Ehsan failed to convince Imran to join a government led by the PML-Q. In the end, the PTI got only   in the 2002 election.  In the next seven years, Imran Khan was one of those who resisted the policies of General Musharraf inside and outside Parliament, with full force and courage. Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif were in exile and Imran Khan was the one who appeared on my shows again and again to criticise Musharraf. Geo faced problems many times due to the “bad mouthing"" of Imran Khan against Musharraf in  . Musharraf used the MQM many times to teach us a lesson by shutting down Geo on cable in Karachi. Many times, Imran Khan was humiliated by MQM ministers in talk shows — but he never gave up.  He made an alliance with Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif after the 2007 emergency imposed by Musharraf. Imran Khan played a major role in the lawyers' movement and opposed restrictions imposed on media. He participated in my road shows many times when I was banned by Musharraf on TV. He was arrested and thrown in jail – but he never made a deal with Musharraf. He refused to contest elections under Musharraf's regime after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007. On the other side, the PPP made a deal with Musharraf. The PML-N decided to contest elections under the Musharraf regime while Imran Khan was shouting on the roads that boycott the election under a military dictator. I remember I met him one cold January night in his party office and told him, don’t boycott the elections because the PML-N will finally decide to contest polls. Imran Khan never believed me. He mentioned the commitment given to him by Nawaz Sharif publicly. He told me, “I don’t trust Zardari, he can betray me — but Nawaz Sharif gave his word not only to me, he also gave his word to JI Chief Qazi Hussain Ahmad and PKMAP Chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai. He will not betray us”.  Unfortunately, I was proved right. First, the PPP and then the PML-N decided to contest the election under Musharraf. Imran Khan felt betrayed by PPP and PML-N. The PPP made a coalition government with the PML-N and both parties became a target of Imran Khan. That was the time when PPP voters in Punjab and KPK started moving towards the PTI. Those were also the days when drone attacks by America in Pakistani tribal areas were on the rise. Imran Khan was the only national leader who organised a long march against drone attacks. His ex-wife Jemima helped him by making a  on drone attacks; she also appeared on my TV show to criticize drone attacks. Imran Khan attacked the ruling elite from Sindh to Punjab and also took a tough position against American policies in the region.  His anti-Americanism made him a hero of an angry youth — that youth became his biggest strength. He emerged as a third political force in the 2013 election. He wiped out the PPP from Punjab and ANP from KPK. He became a proponent of change in Pakistan but slowly and gradually, his own party became a den of many famous turncoats. Imran Khan tried to defend them by declaring they were “electable”, but the people of Pakistan rejected most “electables” in the 2018 elections.  The PTI led by Imran Khan became the largest party in the National Assembly — but all other big parties are making noises about rigging. Once again, the PPP and PML-N have made an alliance but top PPP leaders Asif Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari have many reservations. They know that their reconciliation policy with the PML-N in the past only benefited Imran Khan and if they will shake hands with PML-N again, they may lose more support in Sindh. The PPP is reluctant to openly support the PML-N in the Punjab Assembly. The PPP and PML-N leadership failed to cultivate the support of parties like MQM and BNP, which were the first on the night of July 25 to make noises against rigging.  Meanwhile, Imran Khan successfully managed to get the support of former Musharraf allies like the MQM and PML-Q and an anti-establishment Baloch party, the BNP. It will be very difficult to maintain the support of all these small parties without fulfilling their demands – this is one of the big challenges Imran may face in the coming days. Before touching big foreign policy challenges, he needs to establish his credibility by inducting credible people in the government. Despite many apprehensions from his well-wishers, Imran will try his best to avoid confrontation with state institutions. We may not see the weekly National Security Committee (NSC) meetings in the beginning. Imran Khan will move forward with taking all stake-holders on board – but we may not see him taking dictation from anyone.  Imran asked me about his speech after the election. I said, your humility was a positive gesture. We also discussed why the Indian movie star Aamir Khan was not coming to his oath-taking. I guessed Aamir is not that busy – maybe he is under pressure.  Imran never made any comments and just smiled.  We discussed Indian PM Modi’s telephone call to him. He told me, Modi never mentioned Kashmir, but I am committed to the Kashmir cause. Imran Khan must set examples now to establish that the law of the land is equal for everyone. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) summoned him in the   on August 7. He may not appear in front of the NAB in person on August 7 — but he must appear in front of the NAB after taking oath as Prime Minister. By appearing in front of the NAB, a sitting Prime Minister can give a message to the whole world that it is the beginning of a 'New Pakistan' (Naya Pakistan). He should also respect criticism and critics. I have criticised him many times in the past, but he never ever complained. He must introduce a tolerant policy for media and win support through good governance – not unseen pressures. Imran Khan must realise that he became a majority leader not due to his manifesto. He became a majority leader due to the blunders and mistakes of his political opponents. Now, his opponents are waiting for his mistakes.  He cannot afford any mistakes because once this opposition gets united and starts marching towards Islamabad, Imran Khan will not be able to defend his government without public support.  He needs more public support with pro-public policies.",2018-08-07,"PTI,Diplomacy,Politics,Pakistan",The Imran Khan I know is his own man,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/imran-khan-pakistan-politics-diplomacy-pti/story/1/25921.html
250,Lokpria Vasudevan,"Fifty-four-year-old Sarathy is a known face in Anna Arivalayam, the headquarters of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). Sarathy makes a living selling peanuts. A regular at the DMK headquarters, whenever party chief M Karunanidhi is present on the premises, Sarathy joined the party when he was barely 20 years old. An ardent fan of M Karunanidhi, also known as 'Kalaignar', Sarathy's face lights up when he recalls his experiences of meeting the leader. It's a story Sarathy, who comes from a family of DMK sympathisers, is never tired of telling. ""I don't remember the year exactly, Kalaignar was at Arivalayam and suddenly I got a call to come inside the office. Kalaignar asked my name and bought peanuts and asked me to give some more to all the leaders present in the room."" For Sarathy and many other loyal supporters like him, 94-year-old Kalaignar — who was being treated for urinary tract infection and other age-related ailments until his passing on Tuesday, August 7 — and his unparalleled leadership kept them spellbound till date. Every time Karunanidhi started his sharp-witted speeches with the famous words, ""En Uyirinum melaana anbu udanpirappugale (my beloved brethren who are dearer to me than my life)"", the crowd turned hysterical. 
 
 The DMK is a party that has prided itself on being cadre-based. And Karunanidhi was always deeply popular with the cadres. He knew all the functionaries by name and sometimes surprised the lowest-rung functionaries by calling them out from amid a crowd. Kalaignar's unusual energy and talent saw him treat the party as his first priority. Noted author R Kannan says the heart of the DMK's success lay in its strong cadre connect with Karunanidhi. An extraordinary speaker and writer, Kalaignar penned some 4,000 letters, famously addressing the cadres as 'siblings'. ""His connect with the cadres as well as with the public was such that he superseded senior colleague Navalar Nedunchezhiyan to succeed party founder CN Annadurai. Those who worked hard and delivered saw themselves moving up the ladder. No wonder that he has been the leader of a party for 50 years in a row. He symbolizes an era."" DMK founder Annadurai trusted Karunanidhi with building the party after the break from the Dravidar Kazhagam. Anna sent Karunanidhi to resolve differences between local leaders of the DMK, which the younger man did with great competence. Senior journalist S Murari credits Karunanidhi for imparting political education to cadres through the party mouthpiece   and making them aware of social issues that concerned the state. ""His accessibility to cadres was a big plus point along with the inner party democracy that has gone a long way in holding the party together."" In the early 1960s, it was largely Karunanidhi's energy and rapport with the cadre that helped shape the DMK into a massive political army. Journalist and author Sandhya Ravishankar attributes Karunanidhi's bond with the cadres as the fulcrum of the party. ""He would sleep next to them ahead of big rallies even as pandals were being put up, eat with them, work with them. Karunanidhi is more than a leader to his cadre — he is an emotion to them, a mentor and a friend."" Almost everybody in Tamil Nadu agrees that Karunanidhi, a multifaceted personality, is loved by the cadres, not just for his Dravidian ideology, but for his indomitable spirit that saw Kalaignar win many political battles.",2018-07-30,"Stalin,Tamil Nadu,DMK,M Karunanidhi",M Karunanidhi passes away: The Kalaignar of Tamil Nadu who was loved by his cadres,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/m-karunanidhi-dmk-hospital-tamil-nadu-stalin-aiadmk-dravida-munnetra-kazhagam-annadurai-kaliagnar/story/1/25764.html
251,Dinesh C Sharma,"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has had to tackle a series of events in the past few weeks about which the agency has kept mum. Top management level changes have been effected suddenly, agreements have been signed with private companies for satellite-related work, the navigation satellite programme has suffered a setback, and the moon mission has apparently been postponed. Some of these events like rescheduling of Chandrayaan-2 are operational matters, while others relate to the policy domain. For none of these issues, the space agency has bothered to provide any kind of explanation. This is disturbing particularly in light of the fact that ISRO has always boasted of collective leadership, team work and democratic way of internal functioning. It is well appreciated that space is a risky business and every space agency faces ups and downs. ISRO too has had its fair share of all this in the past two decades — the spy scandal and subsequent delays in the cryogenic engine programme, the Antrix-Devas spectrum scandal, the open spat between former and sitting chairmen a few years ago, and now the sudden removal of Tapan Misra from the post of Director, Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad. If Misra had continued as head of the lab in Ahmedabad he could have been in the running for the top job. In any case, all these are issues relating to the management of the agency but with a definite bearing on the operational part. ISRO has a composite management structure that combines scientific, operational and administrative aspects under one leader — Chairman ISRO-cum-Secretary, Department of Space. Prior to the Antrix-Devas mess, Antrix Corporation Limited (the commercial arm of ISRO) too was under the same person. Now Antrix is headed by an independent Chairman and Managing Director. Still, too much power rests in the hands of one person as he is both chairman of ISRO and secretary of Department of Space. Perhaps it is time to think about bifurcating the two positions. In some quarters, the shifting of Tapan Misra to ISRO headquarters as an advisor is being seen as punishment for the stand he has reportedly taken on the issue of private sector role in space activities. A motley group of working and retired scientists and science activists have dashed off a letter to the President on this issue: “If this (Misra’s stand on privatisation) is true, then the act of transferring Misra will cause widespread demotivation among scientific community as it constitutes a strong signal to scientists to either align their views with the political powers of the day, or else be prepared to migrate elsewhere if they want to practice independent scientific enquiry.” If indeed the government and ISRO are in favour of greater private role in India’s space programme, they should come out with a plan and a roadmap. The private sector has always been a supplier to the space agency and has played a critical role in many areas, but should it be allowed to make, launch and own satellites? This needs wider discourse and consultation.

252,Mehr Tarar,"Earlier this week, I was invited, via Skype, on a panel discussion on an Indian channel that debated — the word debate is somewhat incongruous for a talk with four panellists and one anchor on one side, equipped with clearer sound and picture, and yours truly, a lone voice on the other side, from across the border. The topic was whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi should go to Imran Khan's swearing-in ceremony if all heads of states of SAARC were to be invited. Of course, other than me, it was a unanimous verdict how bad an idea that would be for myriad reasons, most of which I'm sure any reader of articles on Pakistan and India, or a viewer of talks shows in India on Pakistan would be familiar with. No point wasting precious digital space going into that, but more on something else in a bit. The next thing that I spotted was Aamir Khan's name on my timeline, which at any given time is merrily, messily and loudly cluttered with tweets from official feeds of media houses, journalists of all types, and haughty people full of opinions on every topic under the sun on any heat-driven day in Lahore or Delhi, humidity-humdrum-ed Karachi or Mumbai, or the beautiful Islamabad with its very odd collection of those who think they matter, and those who really do. I saw a video clip from some Indian channel that Khan — the actor who is greatly loved and respected in Pakistan — would not be coming to Pakistan. More on that in a bit. Moved, I watched a video of Navjot Singh Sidhu saying wonderful things about his old association and friendship with Imran Khan, and how wonderful Khan was as a cricketer and a person. I didn't watch the whole thing, but apparently, the former cricketer, a very popular TV personality, and presently a politician — Congress, if I'm not wrong — Sidhu said that he'd be going to Pakistan to attend the swearing-in ceremony. All hell broke loose. From those who hate Pakistan, and everything related to Pakistan, and all those who hate Congress in an equal measure, and sometimes even more. Hating your own takes a special kind of coldness and cold-bloodedness; don't you think so? The outpouring of congratulatory messages and best wishes for Imran Khan from Indian people and celebrities is one of those rare phenomena when genuine warmth replaces cynicism and bitterness that seem to define the ill-fated debacle of a thing called a bilateral relationship between Pakistan and India. The reason why I thought I'd write on this To-Go-Or-Not-To-Go is because despite being on Twitter for six years, despite being a regular face on talk shows on both sides of the border, and despite being a sensational and a not-so-savoury headline in both Pakistan and India a few years ago, it all still bewilders me. Not the people in the news, silly, but how those people are inserted into things that are neither news nor scoops nor newsy nor scoop-y enough to be wildly hashtagg-ed or blindly viral-ed. It is just how media houses operate in an age where breaking news about presumably sensational stuff is more important than imparting news that matter. News channels and hourly-updated news portals with their clickbait headlines need a constant supply of information and news to cater to the viewer who despite his censure and condemnation of TV content is like that alcoholic who sneaks out to buy a bottle of cheap wine from the corner booze store when he thinks everyone in the house is asleep. Viewers blame media for presentation of content that is focused on a goal of higher ratings, but media simply gives people what they seem to be addicted to, unknowingly or consciously. Here are the facts: The president of Pakistan has not announced the date for the first session of parliament where leaders of the house are going to be elected. It will be within 21 days after the elections. Imran Khan despite the numbers has still not been elected as the Prime Minister of Pakistan via a parliamentary vote. There is no official date of a swearing-on of a prime minister whose official position doesn't exist at the moment. Since there is no confirmed date for an oath-taking ceremony, there could be no question of any formal invitation to any head of state, a VVIP celebrity like Aamir Khan, former A-list cricketers and close friends of Imran Khan like Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev or Navjot Singh Sidhu. To go or not to go would be debated and decided once the formal invitations from the new government of Pakistan have been sent to India. Until then all it is: unverified pieces of information that is mostly harmless, and some of it carefully placed to deepen the air of mistrust and animosity that sadly are the keywords in what goes for a Pakistan-India relationship. Since Imran Khan and his party do not have any plan to invite the SAARC heads of states at the moment, it is nothing more than mischief creating to debate whether it would be a good idea for PM Modi to accept or decline the invitation. Narratives of enmity are established and deepened through constant dissemination of rumours, innuendos, allegations and blame tossing. After the   when the former called to congratulate the latter on his party's victory, peace-seekers on both sides hope that lines of communication will or should never be broken, even when the relationship seems so strained the slightest misstep could snap it.   and imaginary refusals cannot be construed as anything more than a concerted effort to keep the perception of enmity as strong as ever. The same goes for the invitation to the Muslim Indian Aamir Khan to the future oath-taking ceremony of Imran Khan of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ""the enemy country"". Although many Indian celebrities have been to Pakistan, and very warmly welcomed, and the same goes for Pakistani celebrities, many of whom have even worked in India, in the very acrimonious air of what is presently Pakistan-India relationship, it is nothing more than throwing a proverbial teeli. Aamir is much loved in Pakistan, but he has not been sent a formal invitation to attend the ceremony, and to ask him a question about that where his answer would understandably be ""I am not going to Pakistan to attend Imran Khan's swearing-in ceremony"" is a malicious throwing not just of a teeli but a burning log into kerosene oil intentionally thrown on a slippery marble floor. While I'm one of those many Pakistanis who would welcome Prime Minister Modi as any other visiting honourable head of state, and who would love to have Indian cricketers and actors visit Pakistan, I find it outright outlandish and disrespectful to see all these anti-Pakistan debates with a brand new circus of imaginary invitations and declining of invitations. Debate issues that matter, but it is utterly tasteless for the media that is representative of almost 1.30 billion people to have made-up debates that demean and mock Pakistan's prime minister to-be, and people whom he is friends with or respects, and consequently, mock the very idea of bilateral diplomacy. And I find it all not just bizarre, but sad as hell.",2018-08-05,"India-Pakistan Relations,Navjot Singh Sidhu,Narendra Modi,Imran khan swearing-in",How debates on imaginary invitations for Imran Khan's swearing-in mocked the idea of diplomacy,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/imran-khan-swearing-in-narendra-modi-navjot-singh-sidhu-india-pakistan-relations-kapil-dev-pakistan-general-elections/story/1/25884.html
253,Indrajit Kundu,"In 2005, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had  over “illegal Bangladeshis” finding their way into Bengal’s voter list. She was the principal opposition force to the then-invincible Left front regime in the state. As the lone warrior, Mamata had demanded an adjournment motion to discuss the issue, terming it a “disaster”. When speaker Somnath Chatterjee dismissed her plea, she rushed into the well of the House and threw a sheaf of papers, before staging a dramatic walk-out. Thirteen years later, what then has brought about a complete U-turn in Mamata’s stance, with the TMC coming out as the most strident opponent to the  The answer possibly lies in the changed political landscape of Bengal. In her second term as chief minister, Mamata today has the BJP has her biggest opponent. For a state like Bengal, with its painful history of partition, the BJP’s polarisation agenda has brought to the surface deep wounds that had always existed, but mostly remained subliminal during the decades of Left rule.  The more the communal fissures widen, the easier it becomes for the BJP to make a dent. Initially, the polarisation only seemed to help Mamata consolidate her Muslim vote bank further. Constantly attacking the BJP and PM Modi, she cemented her image as the minorities’ sole saviour and Bengal as a safe haven for them.  But with the BJP quickly replacing the Left as her principal opposition, Mamata became somewhat jittery. Unsure of the reaction from the majority Bengali Hindu community, especially with the BJP's constant propaganda over her “appeasement politics”, Mamata was forced to take a leaf out of the saffron book. 
 
 Over the past two years, Trinamool leaders have proactively conducted Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti rallies to take the steam out of the BJP -VHP combine.  However, the Assam NRC report has provided Mamata a unique opportunity to counter the BJP's communal narrative, by playing the language card. Opposing the citizenship drive, the TMC has termed it the BJP’s “ploy to drive out ethnic Bengalis from Assam”.  While the BJP wants to gain from the rift between Hindus and Muslims in Bengal, Mamata hopes to tide over the communal divide using the Bengali ethnic identity. Here too, there is a subtle focus on the minority vote.  The TMC claims that in Assam, all Bengalis — be it Hindus or Muslims — are termed “Bangladeshis”, an umbrella term used for Bengali-speaking Muslims suspected to be illegal immigrants from the neighbouring country.     Vociferously coming out in protest against the NRC, the TMC is calling this a well-planned exercise by the BJP regime to drive out ethnic Bengalis (read Bengali-speaking Muslims) from the state. When asked if West Bengal would provide shelter to those being disenfranchised by the government in Assam, Mamata said, “We cannot push them back”.  For the same reason, her government had taken a stand against the Centre’s decision to identify and deport to Bangladesh Rohingya refugees, most of whom were Muslims.  Thus, Mamata’s current support for those whose names have been struck out from the citizens’ list in Assam is a strategy to demonise the BJP as a party that is targeting poor Bengali Muslims, while she also pushes a larger Bengali secular narrative, where the community unites based on its linguistic identity, casting aside the religious divide.",2018-08-04,"Bengal,BJP,Bangladeshi immigrants,Mamata Banerjee",From opposing 'illegal migrants' to slamming Assam NRC: What's behind Mamata Banerjee's U-turn,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mamata-banerjee-assam-nrc-illegal-bangladeshi-immigrants-bjp/story/1/25880.html
254,Akshaya Nath,"On May 1, Tamil Nadu woke up to a  of a young woman trying to enter the Draupadi Amman temple at Koonichempet, around 30 kilometers from Pudhucherry, during a temple festival. The woman, who was a Dalit, was denied entry. Almost three months later, on August 3,  demanding access into the temple staged a protest outside it. While some upper castes tried to deny them entry, the collector and the police arrived at the spot and helped sort out the issue, with the Dalits being allowed to offer prayers. “The two groups have promised to behave like brothers. In the future too, we expect the situation to continue like this,” said Pudhucherry collector Chaudhary Abhijit Vijay.   Over 100 people had gathered outside the temple on Friday morning, stating that not being allowed inside the temple was discrimination. “A few months ago, one of our Dalit girls was stopped by some men in the temple from praying to the goddess here. Today, we decided to come here as a group to pray. While we were initially denied entry, later, the collector and the SSP joined in and helped us go inside. It has become evident that there is no caste divide in our village now. They [the upper castes] have assured us that we can come and pray whenever we want,” said Ilayadasan, one of the protesters. While this seems to be a happy ending, it is a shame that even 71 years after Independence, Dalits in the country need to fight to be treated as equals. This, when the ‘Father of the Nation’, Mahatma Gandhi, was a staunch advocate of the rights of ‘Harijans’ — the term he used for Dalits. Tamil Nadu has often seen intolerance and violence towards Dalits. In fact, the state is among the top ten in the country when it comes to atrocities against the community. According to the latest National Scheduled Castes Commission  , one in six cases filed with the National Scheduled Castes Commission is from Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. The National Crime Records Bureau   that over 5,300 of the 32,000 cases of atrocities on Dalits, filed between 2015 and 2017 in the country, were from Tamil Nadu. Over 2,000 of these cases included the crimes of murder, rape, physical and verbal assault. While speaking to media in April, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Ramdas Athawale,   that in 2018, 223 incidents of Dalit atrocities were reported in Tamil Nadu, of which nine were cases of murder. While the crimes have been increasing, conviction rate across the country have fallen. In Tamil Nadu,   of such cases resulted in conviction, according to the NCRB. “Caste-based discrimination continues to be prevalent. Villages are the backbone of the country; its development is based on the development of villages. Yet, in Tamil Nadu, villages are still divided into  (where dominant Hindus live), and  (slums, where the Dalits live). The situation is similar across villages in India. The country is divided into “touchable” and “untouchable” India. Even as the advent of technology and development is changing the face of the country, the caste system is a constant,” says Jayarani, a journalist and writer of Dalit issues. Most activists in the state point out that instances of atrocities before Independence and now are the same. Dalits have always been treated differently, looked down upon. “They can’t wear slippers or certain articles of clothing in front of the upper castes. Urbanisation and the IT boom has led to a lot of Dalits migrating to the cities, and all this is to flee the atrocities against them. Chennai has many slum eviction drives, but for whom are these slums being evicted? The village set-up is being brought to the city as well. Untouchability is a crime, but its root, the cast system, has never been questioned,” Jayarani adds. In over 28 districts in the state, 275 places have been identified as atrocity-prone. The number of reported cases of crime here is very low. There is no implementation of the law, or punishment for caste crimes. Caste fights are common. But now, with improved education and economic levels, the Dalits are raising their voice. Especially after the 100th anniversary of Ambedkar, Dalit consciousness towards the injustice they have been subjected to is rising. In the cases that Jayarani has been able to report on, she observes that the improved lot of Dalits and their increasing assertion creates hatred and a desire for vengeance in the dominant castes. Ambedkar and Periyar are two prominent figures who have questioned the caste system, a vertical, unequal arrangement that the law has done nothing about. Also, cinema, an influential medium, constantly romantises a community or caste, be it Kamal's films  or  to the most recent film of Karthi's,  . All of them display the heroics of a community, and, at some level, give the impression to the youth that it is right to use violence. With this, the caste system gets more intensely integrated in their minds.",2018-08-04,"Untouchability,Caste system,Dalits,Puducherry","In Puducherry, it took police, collector to ensure Dalits entry into a temple: When will this unholy practice end?",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/puducherry-dalits-tamil-nadu-draupadi-amman-temple-koonichempet/story/1/25876.html
255,Ashok Upadhyay,"The final draft of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) has further polarised Indian politics. Battle lines have been drawn with the opposition and government vehemently going after each other. Both blaming the other of “vote bank politics”, a euphemism often used for communal politics in India. But even the Bharatiya Janata Party's stand is not very clear. In principle, the BJP is against illegal migrants and talks about their removal from India. But the party seems to be confused over several aspects of the final draft. Like, if preparing the draft NRC had anything to do with the government or not? Are those forty lakh people illegal residents? And if they are, then what should be done with them? Should they be deported to Bangladesh? On Jul 30, 2018, speaking in the Parliament, Home Minister Rajnath Singh asserted that the Centre   in the preparation of the draft list and it was done on the directives of the Supreme Court. He said, ""In publishing NRC, the government has done nothing. Everything is being done as per Supreme Court order. The allegation of the opposition against the government is baseless"". Talking about those whose names are missing Home Minister said: ""People who feel their name should have been part of the NRC can file claims and objections "". So the Home Minister clearly said that the government has no role in the preparation of the NRC draft and also asked those people, whose names are missing, not to worry because this can be rectified. Yet a day later, on July 31, 2018, the BJP president Amit Shah thumped his chest and  ""Isko amal karne ki himmat nahin thi, hum mein himmat hai… (You did not have the courage to implement it. We have the courage....)"". The BJP chief further said. ""In 2005, the Congress started the NRC (updating process). How can they raise questions now for vote bank politics? You (the Congress) didn't have the courage to drive out Bangladeshi migrants. For you, vote bank politics was important. The country's security was not the priority. The human rights of Indians were not important. You didn't have the courage, so you left it after starting it in 2005"". So Amit Shah clearly suggested that it has been done by the BJP led government. He openly said that Congress governments did not have the courage to identify illegal migrants in Assam. This is in total contrast to what Home Minister Rajnath Singh told the Parliament a day earlier. When the Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey had a public spat with Congress MP Pradip Bhattacharya he was heard shouting, ""All Bangladeshi infiltrators would be driven out of the country."" The Congress MP accused Choubey of misleading people and giving wrong information. Minister Choubey defended himself and said, ""Jo Bharatiya, Bharatiya ban kar rahega wahi desh ka nagrik hoga."" He also said that whoever is Muslim or has come to India from Bangladesh, will be thrown out of the country. Aggravating this issue a BJP MLA in Telangana Raja Singh was quoted saying, ""If these Rohingyas and Bangladeshi illegal immigrants do not leave India respectfully, then they should be shot and eliminated. Then only our country will be safe"". He seems to have knowledge of not only when these illegal immigrants came to India but is also convinced that every one of the 40 lakh names missing from the NRC is an illegal resident of India. He said that during the 1971 war India supported Bangladesh, and it was then that a large number of Bangladeshis ""infiltrated"" into Assam, where 40 lakh such people stayed on illegally. Public statements of these BJP leaders makes it crystal clear that while they are keen to free India of illegal residents they remain confused about the role their government has to play in identifying them. As also on how to send them back to their alleged countries of origin.",2018-08-03,"Bangladesh,Rajnath Singh,Amit Shah,BJP",How the Assam NRC draft has left the BJP confused,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/nrc-bjp-amit-shah-rajnath-singh-bangladesh/story/1/25851.html
256,Bindu Dalmia,"Absolute power has been eluding the Gandhis since 1989 when Rajiv Gandhi was last seen as Prime Minister. Thereafter the family’s only route to power has been through proxies. If not king, playing kingmaker has become the perfect political module for simulated power. In the meantime, PM Narendra Modi’s ‘sankalp’ of a ‘Congress-mukt Bharat’ has been shaping up steadily since 2014, which is reflected through the shrinkage of the Congress’s geographic territory and vote base, paucity of political funds, diminishing authority, and fading media space allocated to it. However, ‘mindspace’ is still hugely retained by the party, as voters do avidly track if the GOP can ever inch back to its original eminence in national politics. In decimating dynasty, even as history books are being rewritten and institutions renamed, the finale now culminates in a museum of Prime Ministers being built within the 25-acre Teen Murti Estate which the Congress is aware is an effort to erode Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy. The symbolism of this decision is a big one in displacing the historic domination of one family that obviated the role of equally tall leaders in their contribution to nation-building. Against the backdrop comes the voluntary downsizing of the Congress’ political ambitions, with the GOP’s climb down by ceding space for prime ministership nine months before the race for 2019 has even begun. Sonia Gandhi has by now perfected the art of making a virtue of necessity, as she did in 2004, after her ‘inner voice’ urged her to relinquish the post of PM — a sacrifice that helped ‘retain power without acquiring the burden of office’. In being ‘willing to accept any non-RSS-backed PM, or any candidate from an Opposition party, the larger goal is first to preserve the party from Modi’s intimidating reign which has eroded the Gandhis’ political and personal fortunes. And by allowing regional aspirants to take the lead to form a collective shield to fight Modi, the united bloc acts as the perfect armour for the Congress. While the process of Opposition unification is underway, the Gandhis cannot afford to play spoiler by prematurely staking claim on consensual acceptance of Rahul Gandhi as the PM face, because that would be a deal-breaker. Their stance is an unknowing adaptation of embracing ‘courage and grace under pressure’, as I borrow from Aung San Suu Kyi’s famous ‘Freedom from Fear’ speech. Except, unlike Suu Kyi’s expressions of fortitude, the Gandhis are anything but free from fear. And displaying grace and courage comes more out of political necessity. The strategic lateral move is based on internal calculations of the Congress, that if the party succeeds in doubling its 2014 tally and comes closer to winning 100 seats, Rahul becomes the lead claimant to head the next government in the event of a fractured mandate. There are three nadirs the Congress has now touched in its struggle for relevance. First, the GOP repeatedly relegates itself to subservience to regional parties in every electorally significant state. This was seen recently in Karnataka where despite having won 78 seats, it decided to play junior partner to JD(S) with 37 seats. Then again, in UP that sends 80 members to Parliament, it is being pushed into a political corner by the BSP and the SP by being forced to accept three to eight seats to contest in 2019. And then again in Bihar, where the Congress will humble down to one of its most venal partners, Lalu Prasad’s RJD. So, in UP, WB, Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, the five states which contribute to around 250 Lok Sabha seats, the Congress is expected to put up a fight in only around 50 to 70 seats from these states, as alliance partners RJD, SP, BSP, Left, DMK and NCP dictate seat-sharing formulae because of their regional dominance. As the gap for the leadership of the ‘anti-Modi’ space closes in, the forerunner who has her base intact, and seems most battle-ready, is Mamata Banerjee. But should Rahul win back Rajasthan or MP, he could be back in the reckoning for leadership of the so-called ‘mahagathbandan’. Opposition calculus is based on achieving optimal Muslim votes, as the community has a decisive presence in roughly 102 Lok Sabha constituencies that can tilt the incremental vote which both BJP and ‘secular’ parties seek. Muslims are unlikely to vote for BJP in any significant way, including their women, despite the party being a crusader for gender equality by pushing for triple talaq. With West Bengal having a 28 per cent Muslim population which is Mamata’s core base, she seems powered to get most of the 42 Lok Sabha seats and retain her lead as contender for PM amongst the united Opposition. The concerted attempt by the Trinamool Congress and ‘The Rest’ is to drive the liberal and urban Hindus away from Modi’s ‘rabid Hindutva’ through tried-and-tested tactics of ‘saam-daam-dand’ (persuade-tempt-threaten). And if all three fail, use the ultimate ‘Brahmashtra’ of incite, as Mamata threatens “bloodbaths and civil wars” over the NRC issue in Assam. As an untested entity, Mamata lacks a pan-Indian appeal to position herself as the ultimate ‘challenger brand’ to woo the nation away from Modi. Though the real face of an Opposition PM will only unveil post-polls, should the need arise, as of now the popularity gap between the PM and his potential contenders remains far too wide to bridge.

257,Tanmoy Bhaduri,"Almost a year after the  , the Darjeeling hills in West Bengal seems to be staring at a new crisis. It all began with a WhatsApp video that went viral in April. The video shows more than a hundred people, in skull caps, descending on Kalimpong town from various directions. According to the video, the people in skull caps are Rohingya refugees. A few days after the message went viral, the imam of a local mosque, Masood Sultan, called a press conference and insisted that “none of them were Rohingyas and they came all the way from South 24 Parganas to take part in a religious congregation"". He also added that if outsiders are seen visiting the place on a regular basis, it is because they are in Kalimpong in search of work. Binoy Tamang, chairman of Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), too rubbished the ""Rohingya rumours"". However, the issue gathered steam after absconding Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leader Bimal Gurung wrote a letter to the Prime Minister on April 27, about an alleged Rohingya camp in  . According to Gurung, Rohingya immigrants are being ""settled in Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts as a conspiracy to cause demographic imbalance and render Gorkhas and other native communities homeless"". also wrote a letter to PM Modi expressing concern over Rohingya infiltration in the strategically vulnerable 'Chicken's Neck' area. In his letter, Ahluwalia, a BJP MP, said he had received reports of Rohingya settlements coming up in various parts of Darjeeling hills and why this is a threat for national security. He reportedly said Rohingyas have taken shelter in Lava, Delo, Melli and Rangpo areas of Kalimpong. To find out the truth behind Ahluwalia's fears and the imam's words, I decided to travel to Kalimpong. Melli is a village about 20 km from Kalimpong town, along the West Bengal-Sikkim border. I saw a hutment with tin roofs under the Teesta bridge, which is the only way to enter Sikkim from any other part of India. I stopped my car and went there. As I went closer, the people seemed reluctant to disclose anything about themselves. There were about 30 Muslim families there. From whatever little they spoke about themselves, I could gather they were recent occupants — perhaps they came here not more than two years ago. On my way back, I stopped by a nearby tea stall and ordered a cup of tea. There I met a man who told me he is a Nepali Muslim. “I and many others came here in search of work. There are about 30-40 families here. We have been living here for a long time, but, yes, some of our relatives are new to the area.” From him, I came to know that they were mostly daily wage labourers, some of them worked as house helps, some others as masons and ragpickers. The shanties were not very old. The area appeared like a slum. There were some newly constructed public toilets on the banks of Teesta. A newly constructed mosque also stood close to the shanties. The door of the mosque looked freshly painted. All these structures stood on government land. Another woman I met at the tea stall casually remarked, “The slum dwellers face huge problems when the Teesta overflows. A few months ago, two children were swept away by the raging Teesta.” A little taken aback, I asked if the children lived in the slums. “Yes, yes, in Chhota Pakistan,” she replied. The woman then explained that the locals referred to the shanties as ""Chhota Pakistan"". ""But where you are standing right now is Pakistan,"" she added with a sly smile. ""Chhota Pakistan"" looked similar to the first hutment. But a Dish TV antenna stuck out like a sore thumb. Here too, people seemed slightly uncomfortable with my presence. As I started enquiring into their whereabouts and the drowned children, no one answered. They spoke Hindi and Nepali. All of them claimed they do not speak Bengali. But, Raj Tamang, a go-between, told me that he could gather from their conversation that they have learnt the languages recently. ""What about the children?"" I asked Raj, because I could clearly hear them speaking Bengali, although the accent was different. ""Who are these people? Are they Rohingyas?"" Some of them claimed they possessed Aadhaar cards. When I asked them to show one, some grew furious. A few others told me they have applied for one. Back in Kalimpong town, almost everyone I met said the number of ""outsiders"" in and around Kalimpong has increased. “People often come here in search of work but some of them never went back. I don’t know if they are Rohingyas or not, but most of them who come here looking for daily wage are Muslims,"" said a shopkeeper near the Clock Tower. I tried to speak to a group of labourers who came to Kalimpong recently. They were sitting at the side of the road where construction work was on. A man, who appeared to be a road contractor, asked them shut up. All of them got up and left the place. I questioned myself, “Who are these people?” “There are Muslim families near Thakurbari living here for generations, but they are small in number. Their lifestyle is very similar to us. They even wear clothes like us and take part in religious festivals of other communities as well. Some of them are married to Nepali Hindus or Buddhists. But of late some more Muslims have come to Kalimpong and  we don't share good relations with them. They recently protested against a pork shop and the local administration has shut it down,” a hotel owner on Kalimpong Main Road told me. A GJM leader and supporter of Bimal Gurung said, “The CM of our state as well as her party sneaks in the Rohingyas to the hill areas to upset the delicate political balance in the area. They are trying to weaken the [Gorkhaland] movement and divide and rule the people.” The GJM leader, however, didn't wish to be named. Political observers say the TMC is eyeing the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat (currently held by the BJP) and hopes to work the Rohingya refugee crisis to its advantage. The GTA, many believe, is working as the CM’s puppet with the names of Bimal Gurung and his close aide, Roshan Giri, already been  . There are arrest warrants against the two leaders who have been absconding following the 104-day bandh. Although the residents of Darjeeling believe that the two will try to pull the strings during elections by fielding puppet candidates, it will be a difficult task for them. The TMC will try make the most of this vacuum. Many believe the TMC is pushing Rohingyas into the hills for vote bank politics. At the same time the party is also trying its best to weaken the Gorkhaland movement for separate state with such strategies. According to BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, the ruling TMC is ""offering shelter to Rohingyas for votes"". ""But these illegal immigrants will pose a huge threat to national security and stability,"" he said. Melli is not an exception. There are similar shanties in various places across Kalimpong. If a local forest guard is to be believed, there is a similar camp in the Graham’s Home area as well. The local population believes Rohingyas are not new to this state. Some Rohingyas have reportedly come to settle in Hardaha, South 24 Parganas too. The ongoing monsoon session of Parliament was rocked by the issue of illegal immigrants on July 31, following the publication of the second and  . The   living in India have been involved in illegal activities. The government also made it clear that Rohingyas do not have the status of ""refugee"" but are ""illegal migrants"".

258,Colonel Vivek Chadha,"The electoral process has come to an end in Pakistan. As was widely expected, Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) has emerged as the  , ahead of Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N). The electoral process suggested the throttling of opposition parties and maintaining the sham of free elections. In particular, the PML(N) was at the receiving end of a pincer-like stranglehold of the Pakistan Army and judiciary. While some celebrate the peaceful transition of democratic power in Pakistan, in effect, this is the shameless continuation of a controlled and subverted democracy. This gives the Army Chief power without responsibility and influence without accountability. Martial law is dead, long live the army! A peek into Pakistan’s recent past is instructive. Nawaz Sharif during his previous campaign had fought elections on the plank of better relations with India. A couple of years into his term, the reality of a government with a clear, popular mandate became evident. He was cornered by a flurry of protests and a barrage of legal cases. Sharif’s dare was not only blunted by the army, he was also defanged in the process. Rendered ineligible to  , he found himself in jail, in the eternal hope of reversing his political fortunes. Unfortunately for him, his future was destined to be shaped by the Pakistan Army. Imran Khan, who had been making the right noises and perceptible overtures to the army, became the obvious choice in the elections. As a result, he gained in both popular mandate and a substantial seat share – on the verge of a majority. This has brought him closer to the hot seat in Pakistan. Amongst his immediate responses, not surprisingly, India found a place in his televised speech.  From India’s perspective, this raises the obvious questions: Will he prove to be any different from Nawaz? What will be his approach to Kashmir? And finally, can India do business with him? Imran’s initial statements are far more pragmatic than those made by Nawaz Sharif. His approach of keeping Kashmir at the centre of any dialogue with India echoes the Pakistan Army’s line – This is however in contrast with India’s stance of keeping terrorism perpetuated by Pakistan as the basis for any meaningful talks with the country. These initial impressions suggest that he will indeed be different from Nawaz, though only more suppliant of the army’s policy towards India. There is likely to be more coherence in civil-military relations in Pakistan, unlike the embarrassing   published by Dawn, which clearly indicated a schism in the past. Imran’s delicate majority in the days to come, potentially with army-coerced support, could further limit his manoeuvring space. This leaves little leeway for Imran to bowl his dipping in-swingers, even with the new ball. The reality of Imran’s approach towards Kashmir suggests that he will not be allowed to have an independent policy on Kashmir, or, for that matter, with regard to India. He is likely to remain the democratic mouthpiece of the Pakistan Army. His master's voice, if one may describe it as such. This implies that the employment of terrorism as state policy by Pakistan is likely to continue. This is until the Pakistan Army finds it either profitable to switch to other options like turning off the terrorism tap, or, is forced under pressure from India and major stakeholders in the region, (read the United States and China) to seek an alternative course of action. This could be influenced by financial constraints, which force Pakistan to negotiate with the International Monetary Fund, where US pressure can influence decision making. Or, it could be a result of unacceptable punishment in the battle of attrition that may emerge along the LoC. India has and will continue to engage with Pakistan, as has been done in the past. However, this does not necessarily imply that talks can or will be held, merely because of a change of government. The reality is that the mask has changed, even as the face behind it continues to remain the same. The Pakistan Army will call the shots while negotiating with major powers in the neighbourhood and more so, where security takes precedence over other issues. The   from the MEA reflects India’s reality check. There seem to be few illusions of an immediate breakthrough. India’s priority must remain a sustained outreach towards Kashmir’s youth. The powers that be should remain willing to go the extra mile, in a bid to create the right atmosphere and achieve the desirable breakthrough on our own side of the LoC. Even as this policy is strengthened, across the LoC, Pakistan must be dealt with strictly on merit - rather than any trace of sentimentality.",2018-08-01,"Kashmir,ISI,Army,Elections",His Master's Voice: Imran Khan is only the new mask on Pakistan's old face,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/imran-khan-pakistan-elections-army-isi-kashmir/story/1/25803.html
259,Pathikrit Sanyal,"“ ” is a jingle many would have heard. The National Egg Co-Ordination Committee’s ads go back a long time, and the message has always been one of common sense: Eggs are good for health. This is, perhaps, a message that has not made its way to a lot of states governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Or so a recent report would suggest. According to an   report, “14 of 19 BJP-majority states deny eggs to children in schools and  .” Swati Narayan, a research scholar and an activist with the “Right to Food” campaign, mapped the inclusion of eggs in mid-day meals in schools and anganwadis across India using government data and media reports. The    lists three very pertinent points. One, of the 10 states with the worst nutrition outcomes in India, only three provide eggs to children (Bihar, Jharkhand and Karnataka). Two, only five of the 19 states governed by the BJP give eggs to children. And three, while some non-BJP states too (Punjab, Mizoram and Delhi) do not provide eggs in mid-day meals, BJP states are most likely to resist the inclusion of eggs for reasons related to the sentiments of vegetarians. The final point — some would call it an assertion — is one that needs to be looked at. Does the BJP have a decidedly vegetarian agenda? If the   is anything to go by, it most certainly does. Back in April, the ministry’s social media account tried to pass off this agenda under the guise of better health through a misleading infographic — a supposedly unhealthy physique was shown comprising of junk food and non-vegetarian items, while a healthy one was shown full of vegetables. But why does this agenda exist? It’s not like vegetarianism is the trend in India. According to a 2014  conducted by the office of registrar general and census commissioner, 71 per cent of Indians over the age of 15 are non-vegetarian. In fact, according to sociologist  , “Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.” Vegetarianism, of course, is not a good idea, especially in the mid-may meal and   schemes. According to Mansi Patil, a public health nutritionist and metabolism clinical dietician at AshaKiran Hospital, Pune, “Eggs will be helpful in addressing malnutrition among kids because   shows that animal-based protein is better than plant-based protein.” In fact, eggs are a good source of a variety of  like vitamin B2, vitamin D, B6, B12 and minerals such as zinc, iron and copper. Egg yolks contain more calories and fat. They are the source of cholesterol, fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K and lecithin. But there may be another factor, apart from the supposed Hindu agenda of vegetarianism — cost. According to the report, eggs may be unaffordable in the north-east because of free poultry industries that pushes up the price of procurement. According to  , “Green leafy vegetables and fruits are available in rural areas with minimum prices and these are important items included in the menu, but eggs are not available and unaffordable.” Even former Union health secretary K Sujatha Rao told  that costs are a major concern in the inclusion of eggs in mid-day meals.  The excuse may be cost or cultural, but the lack of eggs in mid-day meals is a problem that need to be addressed.  ",2018-07-31,"RSS,Mid-day meal,Vegetarian,BJP",Why BJP states denying children eggs in mid day meals is wrong on every count,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/eggs-bjp-mid-day-meal-vegetarian-rss/story/1/25801.html
260,Sushant Talwar,"India is a land of great contradictions. In theory, it's one nation created by stitching together several constitutionally birthed states and union territories. A country where over 1.2 billion people all live together peacefully as a big happy family. However, in reality, it is anything but.  Divided by the invisible lines of creed, caste,  , culture   language, India, much like its people, is held together by its love for the one true God – anarchy.  Though we like to delude ourselves into believing that we are inherently easy going people, united by our love for peace, the ugly truth is that from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, we are a nation of intolerant and violent people who at the drop of a hat are ready to bring entire cities to halt with our propensity for violence.  Case in point, the   that's currently being played outside Kauvery Hospital in Chennai.  Tamil Nadu, seems to be on the burner as thousands of followers and party cadres have gathered around the hospital to express their support for the ailing 94-year-old Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader, M Karunanidhi. However, with their love looking likely to turn chaotic any time, the state machinery has been put on high alert to contain any breakout of trouble in the city.  DMK leaders too have appealed to party cadres and supporters to not lose calm. However, the fact is that   of the Tamil leader's health deteriorating do end up coming true, it will be very difficult to prevent the law and order situation in the city from breaking down.  The latest saga being played out in the streets of Chennai, however, isn't the first of its kind. The city, as well, as the state is used to living through such scares. It happened before when AIADMK's J Jayalalithaa succumbed to a cardiac arrest in December 2016. Though Chennai largely managed to pull through the loss without any major clashes between Amma's followers and the city police, the state did reportedly suffer the   men and women who immolated themselves after hearing of the news of Jayalalithaa's death. Then there was the violence during pro-jallikattu protests which left Tamil Nadu burning for weeks. More recently, anti-Sterlite protests claimed 11 lives after police clashed with protesters in Tuticorin.  Add to the mix Bengaluru's mass molestation horror from December 31, 2017, Kerala's never-ending love affair with communal violence, and Andhra Pradesh's Kapu quota stir from 2016, and one thing is clear that such incidents of mindless violence are not only limited to Tamil Nadu alone but are part of life in Southern India.     Now let me make one thing clear.  This is not an attempt at calling out southern Indian states for such indulgence of mindless violence. Not even close. Like, I've said before, we as a people love anarchy, and as such its only natural for people from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and other southern states to every now and then express their displeasure in the most unthinking of ways. Afterall, as North Indians will attest, bringing law and order machinery down to its knees, and subjecting entire cities to   for something as trivial as the arrest of a godman is a thrill that has no parallels.  As such, the only aim here is to show that despite the barriers of culture and language, South and North India, are truly not that different.  It is to show that attempts by many from the southern states to distance themselves from ""unruly North Indians"", and similar attempts from those in the north, are futile and counter-productive, as, at the end of the day, our love for mayhem binds us together like nothing else does. The sooner we accept this, the better it would be for all of us. ",2018-07-31,"Gurmeet Ram Rahim,Jayalalithaa,M Karunanidhi,DMK",No dividing line: Why North and South India are bound together in their love for anarchy,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-anarchy-violence-dmk-m-karunanidhi-jayalalithaa-gurmeet-ram-rahim/story/1/25802.html
261,Sanjaya Baru,"The White House never became a museum in memory of George Washington. At the Kremlin, only Lenin’s private rooms were thrown open to the public. The rest of the Kremlin continued to perform its official functions, including providing accommodation to Lenin’s successors. In Beijing, Mao Zedong’s home within Zhongnanhai, next to the Forbidden City, was never converted into a museum. And 10 Downing Street has remained the British Prime Minister’s home since 1732. Why then did the official residence of the first Indian PM become a museum? The decision of the authorities at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) — to extend the scope of the memorial from projecting only the life of the first PM to including the contribution of   — has generated expected controversy along predictable lines. While those who have a special place in their hearts and minds for Jawaharlal Nehru do not wish to see any dilution in the kind of homage paid to him, others believe that the contribution of his successors ought to be also recognised. The focus of the controversy has been on whether such a museum for all Prime Ministers should be housed within the premises of the NMML or outside. However, several other issues worth raising have not been addressed. The question may well be asked as to whether it is at all worth celebrating the contribution of all Prime Ministers. I am not aware of any major country around the world that has such a museum in memory of every single head of government. I would not hesitate to assert that so far, only five prime ministers have as yet earned their place in history — Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, PV Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh. Nehru did shape modern India, strengthening the foundations of a nascent Republic. Indira Gandhi left her mark on economic and social policy as well as on regional security. Narasimha Rao provided political leadership at a particularly stressful time in recent history and altered the direction and pace of the Indian economy. Atal Bihari Vajpayee not only declared India a nuclear weapons power but took important economic and foreign policy initiatives that defined India over the next decade. Manmohan Singh presided over an economy that grew at unprecedented rates, contributing to a sharp decline in poverty, and altered the course of Indian foreign policy with the nuclear deal he signed with the United States. Perhaps one could consider the name of Lal Bahadur Shastri, for his leadership during war. None of the others have left their mark in a manner that deserves a mention in a museum. The jury is out on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. If he returns to office in 2019 and distinguishes himself in his second term, he would certainly qualify. However, given India’s fractious and populist politics, no government-funded museum will risk not mentioning all Prime Ministers. Thus, even Gulzari Lal Nanda will get a mention. A more fundamental question that is worth examining is why in the first place, Teen Murti House became the Prime Minister’s official residence, and, secondly, who took the decision, and why, to convert this into a museum. It is worth remembering that Nehru decided to lay claim to the official residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Armed Forces (which is what Teen Murti House was till August 1948) only after Mahatma Gandhi’s death and a year into his tenure. Till then, he lived in a regular Lutyens’ bungalow on what is now Motilal Nehru Marg, like all his cabinet colleagues including Sardar Patel. In 1947, Nehru was, after all, only one among equals. He had to demonstrate to the Mahatma, who chose him for the job, that the Prime Minister-ship had not gone to his head. A majority of the leadership of the Congress Party in fact wanted Sardar Patel to be named Prime Minister. Gandhiji overruled them and named Nehru. Once the Mahatma was gone, Nehru would have felt liberated enough to move into the grand palace of the Commander-in-Chief, located a stone’s throw from the Viceroy’s palace – Rashtrapati Bhavan. Nehru’s decision to live in Teen Murti House was perhaps also an attempt to elevate himself above the rest of the Congress leadership in the public eye. From   (first among equals), Nehru made himself  . Now to the question as to how the Prime Minister’s house became a museum. After all, no one thought of making 1, Aurangzeb (Abdul Kalam) Road a museum for Sardar Patel when he died in 1950. It was Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, as President, MC Chagla, as minister for education and culture, and Indira Gandhi as minister for information and broadcasting, who took the  , with several others supporting them, to convert Teen Murti House into the Nehru Museum. I am not aware if any political scientist or historian has examined the question as to why Lal Bahadur Shastri did not move into what was the official residence of the Prime Minister. Perhaps he did not have the gumption to do so. In the United States, the memory of its first President, George Washington, is celebrated in a museum housed in Washington’s own home at Mount Vernon. Surely, the Nehru family home in Allahabad could have been made the Nehru museum. But it appears such thinking did not prevail within Delhi’s corridors of power at the time —  it seems without doubt that the Nehruvians who survived Nehru did not want any future prime minister to live in the impressive and regal surroundings of the estate of the Imperial Commander-in-Chief. The current debate about the future of Teen Murti House and the NMML offers an opportunity to examine the past and see whether the original decision was in fact the correct decision. The political response would be along partisan lines. However, one hopes that there are enough number of professional historians and political scientists — not blindly partisan — who would be willing to examine this issue afresh and express their opinion.",2018-07-30,"Congress,Museum,Jawaharlal Nehru,Nehru memorial",Evicting 'Nehru' from the Nehru Memorial,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/jawaharlal-nehru-museum-prime-minister-congress-teen-murti-bhavan-legacy/story/1/25766.html
262,Sanjay Jha,"It had been a long day, and since I had woken up early to catch the first flight out to Delhi (I am one of those same-day-return-to-home types), the red eye beckoned. By the time, the airplane soared above, I had dozed off.  My reverie was short-lived, however, as the gentle flight attendant reminded me that I had the onus of ordering a snack and a drink courtesy my pre-booked corporate privilege. There was a young man seated next to me who I suspected suffered from the same predicament; he appeared equally dysfunctional when asked to make his preferred choices. We exchanged smiles, perhaps appreciating our mutual discomfiture with exemplary professional airlines service. Some more sleep would have done wonders for our spiritual constitution. “Are you the same Sanjay Jha we see on TV ?” , asked the curious countenance of the young man giving me a look of palpable incredulity. “Yes”, I said. “The same Congress Spokesperson”.  His face suddenly brightened up, like a big pancake that has hot maple syrup poured over it.  He was happy to see me; unknown to him I was happy to see an effervescent expression.  In politics, nothing enthuses you more than voluntary public support. He was a highly qualified, 27-year-old chemical engineer, who worked with a corporate firm in downtown Mumbai. He was an apposite manifestation of India’s demographic dividend, the aspirational middle-class seeking greener pastures, and one who was intrepidly walking the road less-travelled. Often in the past, I have made long conversations with people while travelling, but only exchanged formal introductions at the very end.  It is incongruous actually, and I have since made a behavioural correction. “What’s your name?” I asked him.  “Javed Khan” (name changed), he said.  “Sir, I want to ask you a question. Will the Congress party win the 2019 elections?” “I think so,” I said. “I hope so”, said Khan; his brief response betraying prodigious nervousness. “Are you very worried?” I asked him, while being fully aware of why this innocuous simple soul was probably disturbed. “Sir, I have already started applying for a job overseas. It seems strange to say this, but I am feeling insecure in our own country. My mother anxiously devours news all evening and looks permanently worried these days. Then she narrates to me the ferocious fights that happen on the screen”.  I felt terribly devastated hearing that from a fellow Indian with a robust professional career ahead of him.  This was not just an accidental, anecdotal occurrence, but perhaps the dominating mainstream sentiment amongst many minorities. On television debates every night, many suited-booted corporate tycoons unleash their well-remunerated merchants of poison distribution on essentially unsuspecting audiences unaware of their real agenda; to sell the ruling party’s political game-plan in return for big-ticket pecuniary favours and acquiring other strategic assets. It is a rehearsed trapeze act, the hate-brigade works with extraordinary synchronicity. It is taking its toll. Love Jihad, Ghar Wapsi, Beef Bans were all caffeinated with unambiguous bigotry, which was their central theme. The horrific lynching epidemic that has shamed India (compelling the Supreme Court to publicly castigate the government for giving a free hand to violent mobocracy, and instructing them to frame a new punitive law) is proving to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back.  Surely, when a senior Cabinet minister does a photo-op with convicted murderers of a heart-breaking lynching victim, and the Prime Minister keeps a resplendent silence, the message is overwhelmingly clear.  After Rakbar Khan’s barbaric killing, when a BJP leader blames it on rising Muslim population, you know that moral perversity has scraped new-lows and humanity itself is in a state of frozen hate.  That’s why Javed Khan wants to leave India. A day later in Mumbai, I meet a familiar face, I often encounter at social gatherings.  He is an affluent stockbroker staying in a plush South Mumbai residential tower. “India has just one problem, and that is its population. We solve that, and everything else will be fine,” he pontificates. “Among other things,” I gingerly caution him. “We are a fractured society, and the recent lynchings are a gruesome refection of that”.  The Dalal Street bull remains unconvinced. “I don’t think so.”  Visibly exasperated but keen to avoid a verbal kerfuffle, I ask him, “The lynching deaths don’t offend your sensibilities?” “No,” he says. “It is no big deal”. “Are you serious? Can I actually mention this in an article I propose to write without mentioning your name?” I ask, completely flabbergasted. “Yes,” he says.  The truth is that he was genuinely disinterested in Rakbar Khan and Alimmudin Ansari. They were just an exasperating intrusion into the otherwise glistening pink papers where the roaring Sensex just transcended 37,000. As Javed Khan said goodbye to me around the midnight hour at the Mumbai domestic airport, he appeared cheerfully optimistic for the first time when I told him, “Tell your mother not to worry. You will not have to leave our country.” But Javed Khan does not need just the Congress party to keep him back. He needs the very country where he was born to stand for him. He needs us. He is one of us. He is not the other.",2018-07-30,"Congress,BJP,Muslims in India,Lynchistan",I made a promise to Javed Khan.

263,Brahma Chellaney,"US President Donald Trump’s first round of Iran-related sanctions has come into force this week, with no waiver for India in sight as yet. The US Congress has passed legislation granting India a waiver from its new Russia-centred sanctions, but the waiver is conditional and contingent upon a periodic presidential certification. The Indian media highlighted the passing of the waiver legislation but not the conditions it incorporated. India, as a longstanding significant buyer of Russian weapons and the second-largest importer of Iranian oil after China, is a major victim of the new US sanctions. By implicitly mounting two-pronged pressure on New Delhi on energy and defence fronts, Washington has injected a major new irritant in the bilateral relationship, as if to underscore the risks for India of pursuing a foreign policy too closely aligned with America. By slapping a nation with punitive sanctions, the US seeks to block trade and financial activities with that country even by other states. Such extraterritorial sanctions — which it euphemistically labels “secondary” sanctions — run counter to international law. Yet the US uses its unmatched power to turn national actions into global measures. Today, however, it faces a major test to effectively enforce its new extraterritorial sanctions relating to Iran, a Trump obsession, and Russia, which still evokes bipartisan hostility in Washington although Russia’s economy has shrunk to one-tenth the size of China’s and its military spending to one-fifth of China’s. Trump’s sanctions aimed at throttling the Iranian economy after his unilateral withdrawal from the multilateral Iran nuclear deal have prompted calls for defiance even in Europe. The new Russia sanctions, however, were initiated by Congress, which passed a law to compel the Trump administration to act against Moscow. Known as Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, the law uses the sanctions threat to wean countries off their craving for Russian weapons so as to boost America’s own arms sales. The US is already the world’s leading exporter of weapons by far. Another paradox is that the US has overtaken Russia as the top arms seller to India. But while Russia has transferred to India offensive weapons, including a nuclear-powered submarine (INS Chakra) and an aircraft carrier (INS Vikramaditya), the US has been selling defensive military systems to India, such as the P-8I maritime surveillance aircraft and the C-17 Globemaster III and C-130J Super Hercules military transport planes. India cannot snap its defence ties with Moscow for another reason: It relies on Russian spare parts for maintenance of its Russian-made hardware, some of the Soviet origin. While the CAATSA waiver will allow India to go ahead with the pending purchase from Russia of the interceptor-based S-400 Triumf air and anti-missile defence system, future Indian imports from Russia are likely to face US scrutiny. In fact, the waiver legislation mandates that India, Vietnam and Indonesia — the three countries granted waivers from the CAATSA sanctions — demonstrate that each is significantly reducing dependence on Russian arms or significantly increasing cooperation with the US. The congressional intent was clearly to leverage the waiver. For example, a presidential certification must specify the active steps each nation is taking or planning to cut its inventory of Russian hardware. Such a reporting requirement, by shining a spotlight on India’s arms inventory, promises to act as an irritant in the bilateral relationship. Washington is also stepping up pressure on India to sign the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), which the Indian military fears could compromise its network. The reason why only India, Indonesia and Vietnam were granted waivers is that the US is trying to sway these three into its orbit. In the case of Turkey, a NATO member that, like India, is buying the S-400, Congress is threatening reprisals against Ankara. US pressure on India, Indonesia and Vietnam, however, is unlikely to fully dissipate because no blanket waivers have been granted. Meanwhile, through its Iran-related sanctions, the US is likely to influence the energy-import policy of India, which currently imports more than three-fourths of its crude oil requirements. According to the International Energy Agency, India is set to emerge as the fastest-growing crude consumer in the world by 2040. Washington is seeking to sell more oil and gas to India and also encouraging it to switch imports from Iran to Saudi Arabia and other US allies. Next-door Iran, however, has long been a major oil supplier to India. It will remain important for India’s energy-import diversification strategy. US sanctions, however, threaten to affect even New Delhi’s political cooperation with Tehran, including impeding India’s Pakistan-bypassing transportation corridor to Afghanistan via Iran. India has invested in modernising the Chabahar Port. As the top US general in Afghanistan acknowledged last year, “Iranian-Indian-Afghan cooperation over the Chabahar Port presents great economic potential” for landlocked Afghanistan, which has had to depend on a hostile Pakistan for access to a port. By making India a key target of the extraterritorial effects of its sanctions on Iran and Russia, and then dangling concessions as favours, the US is doing a disservice to its goal of making the India-US strategic partnership a linchpin of its larger strategy to build a free, open and democratic-led Indo-Pacific region. Its actions compound India’s foreign-policy challenges, including how to balance the relationships with various key players.

264,Rahul Noronha,"If Jawaharlal Nehru is the central BJP leadership’s main hate figure, to be blamed for allegedly not letting India achieve its potential, in Madhya Pradesh it is Digvijaya Singh who is accused by the party in a similar way — even after 15 years of being in power. While on his Jan Ashirwad yatra, a mass contact programme in the run-up to the assembly elections in November, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan does not miss an opportunity to blame Digvijaya Singh’s 10-year rule for keeping MP ""backward"". The ""accuse Digvijaya Singh of ruining the state"" theme has been resorted to in 2008 and 2013 as well. Will it work again? Maybe not and here is why. Chouhan’s charges against Digvijaya Singh revolve around the ""Bijli Sadak Pani"" (BSP) theme, worked out just before the 2003 elections. After a span of 15 years, the electorate wants to know what is being done for roads, for bijli (electricity) and for pani (water) in the state now, and is not interested in what was not done 15 years ago. Of course, the BJP wants to drive home the point that if the Congress is elected again, the state will go back to the days when there was no bijli, sadak and pani. A part of the electorate may be reminded of the time when there were power outages but a new generation of voters has come into being that has not seen the Congress days. The first-time voter was three years old when the last Congress government went out of power. It has heard about Congress days and if it’s mostly bad stuff, it may get swayed too, but there are also other issues the youth of today is facing. There is massive unemployment, especially in rural areas and the Congress has completely failed in making it an election issue but there is still some time. The Congress too, on the other hand, surprisingly does not speak about the ""achievements"" of Digvijaya Singh’s 10-year rule. In the first term, there were innovations in the panchayat sector, grassroots organisations were strengthened and primary education was given a fillip. The result is while there are attacks on the Congress period, there is no defence in the form of what was done. Perhaps the Congress does not want to talk about any of that time, afraid that it may give the BJP an upper hand. Strategically aware of this handicap, Digvijaya Singh too has stayed away from mainstream party work in the run-up to the polls. He is meeting Congress workers and leaders in an attempt to forge unity and to do away with factionalism, leaving running the organisation to ""old friend"" and ""elder brother"" Kamal Nath. Point out any shortcoming in governance to a BJP elected representatative and chances are that he will immediately respond with whataboutery on the Digvijaya Singh years. A question on bad roads is met with ""what about the time when there were no roads"", and a poser on the absolute collapse of civic infrastructure in all cities of the state that witness water logging after an hour of rain are met with ""what about the time when there was no water"" by BJP leaders. It is faintly comic. Chouhan recently put forth three questions to Kamal Nath, all pertaining to the Congress years. Why weren’t there any roads during Congress rule; why was there a shortage of electricity at that time; and why wasn’t the Congress able to increase the area under irrigation? Even budget speeches every year compare the state’s finances to 2003, the year Digvijaya Singh demitted office. In Satna the other day for the jan ashirwad yatra, Chouhan went a step further. He accused Digvijaya Singh of hobnobbing with terrorists. Digvijaya Singh responded by asking Chouhan to furnish proof of being a traitor, of arresting him. On July 26, he courted arrest in Bhopal demanding that he be booked for sedition and jailed. The police did not oblige him after which he said that he will file a defamation case against Chouhan. Digvijaya Singh is aware that he will be baited by the BJP into saying something that will be used against him. During the Narmada Parikrama he had said I will now not respond to everything. Will he stick by it?

265,Lokpria Vasudevan,"In the 2016 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections, AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa proved everyone wrong. Most exit polls had predicted her defeat. Veda Nilayam, her Poes Garden residence, wore a forlorn look.  However, Jayalalithaa bucked Tamil Nadu’s trend of voting out a party after every five years. She became the only chief minister to return to power for two consecutive terms, since her mentor Dr MG Ramachandran.   Two years after the nail-biting elections and one-and-a-half years after Jayalalithaa’s demise, politics in Tamil Nadu has changed drastically. The entry of actor-turned politicians Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, and the resurgence of sidelined AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran have altered the contours of the Dravidian polity.   The results of a survey conducted by Thanti TV, a Tamil regional channel, ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls have come as a dampener for the AIADMK. The popularity of the government is clearly on the decline.   The survey was conducted in 32 districts of Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Puducherry between July 1 and July 10. A total of 8,250 people were asked for their opinions. A significant 41 per cent of respondents said they would vote for the DMK-Congress coalition if Lok Sabha polls were held today. The AIADMK is a distant second, with 25 per cent. According to the survey, there is widespread dissatisfaction in the state with the performance of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. A massive 75 per cent of the respondents said the demonetisation decision of the central government was “not worth the effort”. The survey reflects that very little has changed for the saffron party since its 2014 debacle in Tamil Nadu. In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP was riding high on the Narendra Modi wave. While it worked in the rest of the country, the south of Vindyas saw a different story. With a scant presence in Tamil Nadu, the BJP found it hard to connect with an average Tamil voter. In the Dravidian heartland, the 2014 Parliamentary elections were remembered as a presidential battle — Lady vs Modi. Despite cobbling up a rainbow alliance that included several regional players, the BJP could win only 2 out of 39 Parliamentary seats. By winning 37 seats, the AIADMK became the third largest party in the Parliament. Political analysts say the survey cannot be used to predict the BJP’s performance in the rest of the country, since the party has never had a significant presence in Tamil Nadu anyway. BJP Spokesperson Narayanan Tirupathi has dismissed the survey as premature and unscientific. “People of Tamil Nadu are very clever. They will not accept Rahul Gandhi as prime minister. With the election still a year away, how can the survey assume that the DMK and the Congress will be in an alliance and the BJP will contest alone? Tirupathi said. The DMK camp, on the other hand, is euphoric. “The survey findings are a direct result of the failed governance at the Centre plus the false promises made when the BJP swept to power in 2014. Farmer distress continues, black money hasn't come back, people like Lalit Modi, Nirav Modi have escaped India. It's these false promises that have turned the people of Tamil Nadu against the BJP government. Parties that oppose the BJP will do well. The AIADMK has been subservient to THE BJP. They will suffer a worse defeat because of their quid pro quo arrangement,” said DMK Spokesperson Manu Sundaram. Interestingly, the survey also gauges the mood of the voters on the newbie politicians —actor Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan. Both of them are on an equal footing, with 5 per cent voters supporting them.  Rangaraj Pandey, editor in chief of Thanti TV, observes that there will be competition between RajInikanth, Kamal Haasan and Dhinakaran to emerge as the alternative in Tamil Nadu’s bipolar politics.  “As of now, Rajinikanth, Kamal Hasaan and TTV Dinakaran can be game changers or spoilers. They all have a 5 per cent vote share. This may increase to double digits when elections come. While Kamal and Rajini don’t see a surge of votes in their favour, for a very new party, a 5 per cent vote share is encouraging. Even if they can’t create a huge impact in TN’s political landscape, they might certainly emerge as the deciding factor in who can win and who can’t,” said Pandey.  ",2018-07-28,"TTV Dhinakaran,Kamal Haasan,Rajinikanth,Tamil nadu politics","Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, TTV Dhinakaran: Will the challengers turn kingmakers in Tamil Nadu?",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tamil-nadu-politics-rajinikanth-kamal-haasan-ttv-dhinakaran-aiadmk-dmk-congress-bjp-karunanidhi/story/1/25737.html
267,Aroon Purie,"On February 2, 1983, India woke up to the horror of Nellie, a tiny village in Assam's Morigaon district. Assamese tribals surrounded three villages populated by Bangladeshi migrants and, in the course of just one night, hacked over 2,000 men, women and children to death. Nellie, by now synonymous with extreme xenophobia, was a story India Today broke in its March 15, 1983 issue. It remains one of independent India's most horrific pogroms, revealing the darkness that lives in the hearts of men and how seemingly peaceful agitations can explode into savage bloodfests. Thirty-five years later, Nellie still haunts us. More so as the government of Assam, a state of 30 million people, completes a Supreme Court-monitored National Register of Citizenship (NRC). By all accounts, it is not who the NRC includes but who it excludes that will be keenly watched. Our sources estimate that at least 2 million people — more than the population of Goa — are likely to be left out of this citizenship verification and, consequently, declared stateless. Our cover story, reported by senior associate editor Kaushik Deka, reveals the fear and uncertainty among them. Worryingly, he discovers, Assam's NRC could have a ripple effect on other parts of India. A majority of these stateless people are likely to be Muslim, and a communal narrative is already being prepared — from propagating a false narrative that 7 million Muslims will be stripped of citizenship to explicit attempts to convert Assam's battle against illegal immigrants into a religious conflict across the country. Illegal immigration is a thorny issue because it feeds on fears of displacement. A 2017 interim report by a six-member committee headed by former election commissioner HS Brahma noted that illegal Bangladeshis dominated 15 out of Assam's 33 districts and are 'threatening the indigenous people of Assam'. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) defines a stateless person as ""someone who is not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law"". Stateless persons are denied a range of rights, such as voting, property ownership, identity documents, employment, education and health services. In 1982, new laws in Burma (now Myanmar) stripped an estimated one million Rohingya of citizenship, provoking a refugee crisis that continues to this day. Fortunately, we also have examples where large protracted situations of statelessness have been resolved. Some 300,000 Urdu speakers, also called 'Biharis', were left stateless with the birth of Bangladesh in 1971. In 2008, the Bangladesh High Court gave citizenship to those born after 1971. More recently, in August 2015, India and Bangladesh ended a 300-year territorial anomaly of enclaves, by swapping land and people. Over 14,000 residents remained in India and became Indian citizens and over 37,000 residents became Bangladeshi citizens. The Union government is believed to be considering proposals for long-term 'biometric work permits' for stateless people but without voting rights or the right to buy immovable property. The question then arises, what becomes of the property already acquired by stateless persons? Will the state then take away such properties? This is a recipe for chaos. One of the missions of our magazine is to anticipate potential flashpoints. This is one such story. The NRC, due to be out on July 30, is likely to make Assam a tinderbox. There are enough venal politicians around who will exploit such a situation for political gain. It will be a critical test for our political class to find an amicable solution to this problem. This is not a regional issue, but a national one. India can ill afford another Nellie. Not now and not ever.

268,Arindam De,"Imran Khan's victory speech on July 26 was an ode to Pakistan's all-weather ally — China. Given that hardly any country in the world is ready to break bread with Pakistan, it is understandable Khan, who is now set to take over as the country's Prime Minister, reached out to China. The Prime Minister-elect played the electoral game much like 'Kaptan' as his followers love to refer to him and made it clear that he will stick to the economic reforms ushered in with the help of China. No leader at the helm of affairs in Pakistan can afford to overlook its all-weather friend and ally China, a country that stood by Islamabad even when the world looked away. Whether the policy will be in China's interest in the long run is best left for the future to decide. Next up on Khan's focus was Afghanistan, a country that shares historic and social ties with Pakistan but has over a period of time gravitated towards India accusing Islamabad of harbouring terror outfits. Imran Khan spoke at length on his wish to mend ties with Afghanistan, sit across the table and sort out issues. An important statement, considering that in today's geopolitical scenario, Pakistan needs Afghanistan on its side more than Afghanistan needing it. It is only natural that Khan would watch out for what role China wants him and his country to play in Afghanistan. What can't be ignored is that China will like a bigger say in matters concerning Afghanistan. Khan also acknowledged the support Saudi Arabia has extended to Pakistan. This acknowledgement is understandable as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is one of the largest benefactors of Pakistan. The relationship with USA was termed 'one-sided', which is, true in many ways. 
 
 As the war on terror spearheaded by the US winds up in the Middle East, the 'need' for Pakistan has dwindled. The US has also come to openly speak out how little Pakistan is doing to control terrorists using its soil to launch attacks and spread terror in the world, a fact India has long been pressing. Like many of his predecessors, Khan was quick to latch on to the Kashmir issue. He brought up the thorny issue as soon as he started to talk about ties with India. That relation with India would figure low in Imran Khan's list of priorities is not surprising. The fact that he raised the issue of the presence of Indian troops in civilian areas of Kashmir, provides a window to what India can expect of him in the days to come. But that he spoke about the need to sit down and talk and find a solution is welcome. Khan concluded promising to focus on all round development, including economic front. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was effective, if not a hugely successful. He does not carry the taint of corruption and the youth sees him as someone who can deliver. What he said in the context of India was mostly on expected lines.

But this picture changes drastically when you look region-wise within the state. Conventionally, Karnataka is divided into four regions — Mumbai Karnataka, Hyderabad Karnataka, Old Karnataka or Old Mysore region, and Karavali or Coastal Karnataka. Mumbai and Hyderabad Karnataka together can be called North Karnataka, which consists of 10 districts.  Even while the region has given the state six chief ministers, health and infrastructure development in North Karnataka has been dismal over the years. Of late, the bottled-up frustration of residents of that region has been coming out. People feel they have been treated as a stepchild and have been ignored over 70 years.  There is some truth to the allegations. With just one visit to any of the 10 districts, you can how economically backward the area is. When I went to cover Rahul Gandhi’s election tour in Koppal, just outside his guest house, there was a bunch of pigs eating litter and roaming freely. This is a common image across North Karnataka. While South Karnataka is well irrigated, north Karnataka still largely depends on rainfall for agriculture and most land falls under dry zone. Successive governments have spoken of irrigation projects to revive agriculture, but little has been implemented on ground. However, South Karnataka too has its share of underdeveloped areas. Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Chamarajanagar are also ignored. While there have been claims that the south gets better budgetary allocations than the north, many districts in the south are yet to have basic needs met  Drinking water continues to be a major problem in Kolar and other neighboring districts in the South. If the South is overall doing better than the North, it is not just because of the government, but the people of the area.  But the demand for a   is unlikely to gather much steam.  People of the region know that if they break away from Karnataka, they would go backwards by 100 years. The demand of a separate state is more about politics than about people’s rights. The issue will be kept alive with an undercurrent of Lingayat (dominant in North Karnataka) and Vokkaliga (dominant in South) rivalry.

Fadnavis’s decision came after agitators demanding reservation for the Maratha community threatened to not allow him entry into Pandharpur, accusing his government “of not being serious” about the quota issue. Fadnavis claimed that the agitators had planned to create a stampede-like situation in the temple town — where around 10 lakh devotees would be gathered — if he visited it, and he did not want to put devotees' lives at risk. Joshi, too, had taken a similar step in 1997 after the police  on protesting Dalits in Mumbai’s Ghatkopar area.  The Fadnavis government has claimed that the anticipated clash in Pandharpur was part of a larger conspiracy to embarrass it, with the agitators wanting to create a “Govari-like” situation in the holy town. Politicians in Maharashtra are still unnerved by the mention of the   Around one lakh members of the tribal Govari community had gathered outside the legislature in Nagpur on November 23, 1994, demanding scheduled tribe status for the community so they could avail reservation benefits. The police had caned them out, which led to a stampede, leaving 114 people dead. This incident became one of the reasons for the defeat of the Sharad Pawar-led Congress government in the next year’s election. “The plot in Pandharpur was a similar one,” says a Maratha minister. “If some devotees had died in the stampede, it would have become a tool for the Opposition to corner the CM before the next year’s elections.”  Fadnavis is the first chief minister of Maharashtra to face agitations at regular intervals, ever since he took over the reins of the state on October 30, 2014. The Marathas have come out on the streets 58 times, demanding reservation. Farmers have gone on strike demanding better prices for their produce. Tribals held a long march demanding forest land to be registered in their name, milk producers tried to stop milk supply to Mumbai demanding Rs 5 grant per litre, farmers agitated against Fadnavis’s brainchild, the Nagpur-Mumbai Super Communication Expressway (popularly known as Samruddhi Corridor), and students have protested because of examination goof-ups by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC).  A popular theory says that Fadnavis has been incessantly targeted by the Opposition because he is a Brahmin. Maratha leaders have supposedly not been able to digest the fact that a Brahmin has become the chief minister, when the community’s population is hardly 3.5 per cent, against the 35 per cent Marathas. Sharad Pawar, the tallest Maratha leader,  when the BJP nominated Chhattrapati Sambhaji, a descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji, to the Rajya Sabha in 2016. “Earlier, the Chhatrapati used to appoint a Peshava (Brahmin prime minister). Now, a Peshava has appointed a Chhatrapati,” he had said.  However, Fadnavis himself rejected this theory long ago. He says there have been agitations because the Opposition wants to destabilise a “performing government”. On July 19, he informed the Vidhan Sabha that his government had taken various measures for the benefit of Maratha students, such as concession on educational fee, hostels, more admissions to skill development courses, and monetary support to start businesses. The growing aspirations of every class of society is another reason for the agitations against the Fadnavis government. The people looked at the Fadnavis government as a ""saviour"", as they were fed up of the Congress-NCP marked by corruption and policy paralysis. They feel disappointed as they are still struggling with the system. Fadnavis introduced the Right to Service Act to deliver 377 services on time at people's doorstep, but that has not satisfied them. They want more. They want better living standards, transport, employment opportunities, housing, and something that they can feel proud of.  No doubt the frequent agitations are political, but they will die a natural death the moment people start feeling proud of Fadnavis.

271,Hamza Ameer,"In the most anticipated standoff between political contenders for power in Pakistan, it was the people of Pakistan, who used their right of choice through vote on July 25, 2018 marking Pakistan’s Election Day. Over 105 million eligible voters got a shot at selecting their leaders in their respective provinces and the National Assembly. As many as 12,570 candidates are contesting for a total of 849 seats of the national and the provincial assembly. Massive appointment of electoral staff and law-enforcing agencies was witnessed in 2018 elections. At least 1.6 million electoral staff performed duties in the polling stations, while at least 449,465 policemen, 800,000 law enforcement and army personals discharged duties for ensuring security on July 25. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) also formulated special security measures for at least 17,007 polling stations, declared as ""highly sensitive"". At least 85,307 polling stations were set up across Pakistan. The voting day had a slow start but gained momentum as polling stations were flocked by voters. Imran Khan, the chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is being seen as the favorite to win the elections. However, among the top three competing parties, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Pakistan Muslim League — Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan People Party (PPP), two parties raised serious reservations and concerns over the overall process of voting, accusing that a coordinated rigging was being done by electoral staff, security forces and levies to manipulate the ballots in favor of Imran Khan. In a letter written to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), PML-N and PPP accused the electoral staff, primarily at female polling stations, for opting to blatant rigging and tampering ballot papers in favour of PTI head Imran Khan. The polls were also affected by the devastating blast in Quetta, which claimed lives of at least 32 locals including two young children. Top political leaders along with leaders of prescribed outfits also casted their votes. Shahbaz Sharif, Bilawal Bhutto, Asif Ali Zardari, Imran Khan and other prominent leader casted their votes from their respective constituencies. Among the prescribed leaders, Hafiz Saeed, Abdul Rehman Makki and Saifullah Khalid also cast their votes. However, Imran Khan has been declared as the frontline runner to taking control of Pakistan’s as per public polls. As per poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan based on data from five separate polls, forecasts and predictions indicate that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is more likely to emerge as the largest part on the national level. However, the research organisation concluded that the 12 per cent undecided voters may tilt the balance of the election in Punjab, the country's largest province, thus ultimately determining the fate of the next federal government. According to reports from Pakistan, Imran Khan’s PTI has been leading on 119 seats followed by Shahbaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on 61 and 40 seats, respectively. ",2018-07-25,"PTI,Haifz saeed,Imran Khan,Pakistan general election",Is Imran Khan all set to be man of the match in Pakistan elections 2018?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pakistan-elections-pml-n-imran-khan-pti-nawaz-sharif-hafiz-saeed-ppp-bilawal-bhutto-zardari/story/1/25681.html
272,Geeta Mohan,"Once the biggest national party of Pakistan, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) cannot be ignored in the general elections. This underdog could well be the ""kingmaker"" if the Pakistani electorate throws up a hung Parliament. The intense exchange of vitriol at the hustings witnessed for the 272 seats is unprecedented and unmatched. With 141 seats in Punjab, it is clear that the road to Islamabad passes through the state which traditionally has been a Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) stronghold. In 2013, Nawaz Sharif picked up 118 of his 126 seats from the Punjab. But this year, things look different. The corruption scandals and the indictment of Nawaz Sharif will cost the party dearly although his return to Pakistan and courting arrest must have undone some of the damage — but may not be enough to sweep the polls. Imran Khan, the flavour of the season, has made a major dent in the poll prospects of other parties with the way he has managed to maintain an ultra-nationalist campaign with a clear anti-India rhetoric that has helped his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), gain space within Pakistan’s military establishment. Last election, PML (N) won 126 seats, PPP 33 and PTI, a mere 26. This time around, there will be a huge gain by the PTI, and the PML (N) will certainly not get the same number of seats.  The other factor which will cut Sharif's votes is the propping up of extremists such as Hafiz Saeed and his supporters this election. With Hafiz Saeed himself being banned, his son Talha is standing for elections. Hafiz Saeed has put up around 260 candidates under the umbrella of Allah-o-Akbar Tehreek (AAT), a registered political party, given that his own party, Milli Muslim League’s request for registration was rejected by the Election Commission of Pakistan. But that did not stop the Pakistani establishment from mainstreaming terrorists. Now, this third factor will be detrimental to PML (N) prospects in the elections. With the PML (N), the PTI and the extremists, all vying for Punjab, it is the PPP which will most likely retain the Sindh seats. The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) might also get a certain number of seats and are going to be key to government formation. Bilawal Bhutto, the PPP's prime ministerial candidate, who, for now, has only been focused on his campaigning, could also become an important factor in the post-poll scenario of Pakistan. Will the PTI forge an alliance with the PPP, and will that be an alliance of comfort for the establishment?

273,Lokpria Vasudevan,"The recent   have rung alarm bells in the power corridors of Tamil Nadu. Nagarajan Seyyadurai, the managing director, is said to have close links with leaders in the ruling AIADMK.   A prominent civil construction firm, the SPK group has won contracts worth over Rs 2,000 crore in the past few years.  I-T sleuths have recovered over Rs 170 crore of unaccounted cash and gold bullion of over 100kg during searches conducted at 10 premises of SPK Group across the state. 
 
 The rise of Nagarajan Seyyadurai is a classic rags to riches story. From humble origins, Nagarajan climbed up the corridors of power at a meteoric pace. The story begins with Seyyadurai, a small-time goat trader from Aruppukottai, a town nearly 50km from Madurai, who started off by selling goats to butchers. He came in touch with Suganya Ramakrishnan and Sundararaj Reddiar, small-time contractors in Aruppukotai. Along with them, Seyyadurai started taking up small-scale work in the state highways department. The trio also started a spinning mill in Kallakurichi. However, owing to internal differences, Reddiar and later Ramakrishnan exited the business. Seyyadurai soon started to single-handedly take up contracts for road projects. Sources say Seyyadurai gradually developed connections with leaders in the DMK and AIADMK. He, however, developed closer ties with the AIADMK after the party came to power in 2011, and thus began his rapid rise. In an effort to expand his business operation, Seyyadurai's son Nagarajan, an engineering graduate joined the family business. Soon, Nagarajan moved to Chennai to strengthen their business operations. In Chennai, he befriended a senior minister's son, who had interests in state road and highway projects. This led to a spurt in business. The SPK Group bagged many of the lucrative tenders in the highways department in the past few years. Sources in the state secretariat say Nagarajan was a regular visitor to the secretariat and wielded influence in political circles. Nagarajan Seyyadurai is director of three companies: SPK Spinners private Limited, Sri Balaji Tollways (Madurai ) Private Limited and SPK and Co Exppressway Private Limited.   Interestingly, the director of SPK and Co Expressway Private Limited is Subramanian Palanisamy, father-in-law of Mithun, who is the son of Tamil Nadu CM Edappadi Palanisamy. Subramanian Palanisamy and Nagarajan have other business connections as well. They both jointly run the Sri Balaji Tollways Madurai (Private) Limited, another prominent company that has bagged contracts from the state highways department. The company was incorporated in February 2016 with Subramaniam Palanisamy as the director. Nagarajan joined as its director in September 2017. The company bagged the contract of four-laning of the Madurai ring road in 2017. An additional grant was issued in March this year for completion of the project.  The I-T raids on the premises of the SPK Group across the state are politically significant for two reasons. Firstly, the department of highways is a portfolio directly under chief minister chief minister Edappadi Palanisamy. The raids have highlighted direct links between the chief minister’s relatives and the firms that have been raided. It has also exposed discrepancies in tendering process in the highways department. The CM has been holding the additional portfolio since 2011. The I-T raids on SPK Group came close a week after searches on the premises of Christy Friedgram Industry, a major supplier of food to over 563 Anganwadi centres in Tamil Nadu. Political analysts believe the successive I-T raids are an indirect attack on EPS. Secondly, the opposition DMK had earlier alleged that EPS was favouring the SPK Group in awarding contracts, and filed a complaint with the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption.  The party even submitted a memorandum to governor Banwarilal Purohit, seeking a probe into the ""criminal misconduct"" by the chief minister in the wake of IT raids. 
 
 Unfazed by the developments, chief minister Edappadi Palanisamy has blamed opposition parties for making unsubstantiated allegations and asserted that the I-T raids have nothing to do with his government. He further added that he has friends/relatives all over the state who bid for contracts from the government and termed the opposition allegations as politically motivated.",2018-07-24,"Edappadi palanisamy,Spk group,Tamil Nadu,Income tax raids",From goat trader to millionaire - How Nagarajan Seyyadurai's SPK group shot to the top in Tamil Nadu,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/income-tax-raids-edappadi-palanisamy-spk-group-tamil-nadu-aiadmk-stalin-dmk-gold-cash/story/1/25654.html
274,Ali Madeeh Hashmi,"Sooner or later, one has to take sides — if one is to remain human. Graham Greene,  I was recently witness to a most passionate political discussion in, of all places the city of St. Louis, Missouri, in the USA. The participants were all expat Pakistanis who have lived in the USA for 20+ years and have no intention of ever returning to Pakistan. Their children were all born in the USA and, in most likelihood, will also never live in Pakistan. This is the effect that Pakistani politics has on people — even people whose lives are not affected by it in the slightest way. As Pakistan heads into its third consecutive  in the last 10 years, a record in a country where civilian rule has regularly been interrupted by military dictatorships, the political landscape is familiar. There is Pakistan’s oldest existing political party, the Muslim League. It has been headed for the last three decades by three-time Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif, who was recently disqualified (unfairly, argue his supporters) and jailed for corruption. The party is generously labeled "" "" although its coddling of religious extremists was a perpetual thorn in the side of Pakistani liberals during its years in power. In a surreal turn of events, Mr Sharif, the protégé of a brutal military dictator and his Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N), have become something of a darling for Pakistan’s intelligentsia, by dint of Mr Sharif’s repeated tirades against the Pakistan Army and its ubiquitous ""agencies"". Even though Mr Sharif is in jail, his younger brother, Shahbaz, now head of the party, has been campaigning hard and the PML(N) remains a force to be reckoned with. Then there is the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), founded by one of Pakistan’s most popular politicians, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (later deposed and hanged by a military dictator). The PPP is headed by his grandson Bilawal, son of the slain Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. In the 2013 election, due in no small part to the alleged  and nepotism of then-President Asif Ali Zardari (the late Benazir’s husband), the PPP was soundly  in most of the country and reduced to a rump in its home province of Sindh. Now, Mr Bhutto has been campaigning hard all over the country and the PPP, by virtue of its origins, is the only party that can lay claim to a secular, progressive, woman- and worker-friendly agenda, even though they have drifted far away from it in the last two decades. The ""upstart"" in this campaign is the Pakistan Tehreek-e Insaf (PTI), founded in 1996 by the charismatic and mercurial Imran Khan. Mr Khan’s exploits on the cricket field were, of course, legendary and included Pakistan’s first and only win in the World Cup in 1992 under his leadership. Following his cricketing career, Mr Khan distinguished himself by opening Pakistan’s first charity-funded cancer hospital in Lahore (he has since replicated that feat in Peshawar and Karachi) as well as by building a popular university in his hometown of Mianwali. His foray into politics in 1996, when he founded the PTI, was less successful until 2013, when he managed to garner  based on his program of   (Justice), becoming a legitimate force on the national stage. Mr Khan is now convinced that his time has come to form a national government. His campaign has been dogged though by whispers that it has the overt and covert support of Pakistan’s ""Mil-tablishment"" (a phrase denoting the shadowy nexus between Pakistan’s intelligence agencies, sections of the military high command and the bureaucracy, all accused of regularly  in elections as well as undermining civilian governments). Mr Khan’s own gaffes on the campaign trail have not helped, nor has the fact that his originally anti-establishment party now boasts a galaxy of cast-offs and turncoats from the entire political spectrum. His recent speeches highlighting his support for Pakistan’s   are also alienating many. There are a host of regional parties, none of whom are expected to get more than a handful of seats, and as usual, the hard-right clerics, many belonging to internationally proscribed religious groups who appear to have been mainlined just before the elections — once again, with the blessings of Pakistan’s "" "". Despite all this, there is just the hint of a silver lining. Educated, independent campaigners are making a mark. One example is lawyer-turned-social activist   in Karachi, who made waves by refusing to denounce Pakistan’s long-suffering Ahmadiyya community, and earned the wrath of the mullahs. Pakistan’s miniscule and fractious Left, although they have never achieved any notable electoral success, are also fielding a handful of candidates including in Islamabad, the capital, under the banner of the Awami Worker’s Party (AWP). Their platform — employment, a livable minimum wage, womens’ and minorities rights, religious and ethnic pluralism, affordable housing and climate protection — reflects the aspirations of ordinary Pakistanis more than any other political party. There is also the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (Pashtun Protection Movement), a grassroots movement from Pakistan’s war-torn ""tribal areas"" on the border with Afghanistan, which has garnered huge support (mainly among ethnic Pashtuns and the intelligentsia) for its vocal opposition to enforced disappearances and army excesses in the tribal areas. They have also fielded a handful of candidates — and may have a real chance of winning at least one or two seats. So, where does that leave those of us who are undecided? Ideally, the AWP’s worker-, woman- and minority-friendly platform would be a Pakistani liberal’s dream come true. Sadly though, their actual electoral prospects appear dim, at least for now. Should we then cast a vote for the PML-N as a ""protest"" vote against Pakistan’s establishment and in favour of civilian supremacy? Or, should we overlook Mr Khan’s missteps and give his PTI a chance? What about Mr Bhutto? Can he revitalize the PPP into a liberal, secular, worker and poor-friendly party like he has promised? And what is to come in the future? The answer, as usual, was given by Pakistan’s foremost poet-intellectual Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Back in the late 1960s or 1970s, the story goes, someone wistfully asked him, "" "" (""Faiz sahib, what will become of Pakistan?""). Faiz looked at the questioner with hooded eyes, inhaled deeply on his ever-present cigarette and replied in his soft drawl, "" !"" (""Brother, I suspect that Pakistan will continue the same way"").

275,Vandana,"Almost immediately after the reconstituted Congress Working Committee (CWC)   that party president Rahul Gandhi could be projected as the face of any alliance formed with the aim to take on the might of the Narendra Modi-led BJP in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the plan faced its first challenge - from the mercurial Mamata Banerjee. Banerjee, who is known to be nursing Prime Ministerial ambitions, is a regional leader but Indian political history tells us that when coalition governments take centrestage, just about any leader can find himself in the PM's chair. Deve Gowda, whose party (then known as Janata Dal) won 46 Lok Sabha seats in the 1996 elections, occupied the chair for about a year. Aiming to win all 42 Lok Sabha seats from West Bengal, Banerjee's ambitions only find backing from examples such as those set by Gowda and IK Gujral. Both Gowda and Gujral became Prime Ministers through the Rajya Sabha route. Banerjee at least will be able to take the electoral route to the PM's chair. But the problem with Banerjee's dream stems from the fact that the West Bengal chief minister has no alternative narrative to offer, even as she has dared to take the fight against the BJP straight to Modi's doors, forcing the PM to dedicate significant parts of his high-octane speeches to Banerjee on many occasions. In a   to  , Banerjee said the Opposition is trying to cobble up anti-Modi and anti-BJP votes. She accused the BJP of ""committing atrocities, inflicting torture"" alleging, ""They (BJP members) are behaving like a hundred Hitlers"". While the 'Adolf Hitler' analogy stills seems too far-fetched in the Indian context, the violence and high-handedness that Banerjee seems to be alluding to, ironically, find reflection in her own politics in West Bengal. The victory Trinamool Congress claimed in the state's recent Panchayat polls had blood spilled all over it. Such was the terror rained by TMC men that on over one-third of the 58,792 seats, the BJP and Left Front  . Candidates from rival parties were mercilessly beaten up, forcing the intervening court to allow  . This was unprecedented, even in West Bengal's bloodied political past. The party exercises almost complete control over its cadres now. As chief minister, Mamata Banerjee clearly allowed a free rein to cadres indulging in violence. It is important to note here that Banerjee first became chief minister in 2011, ending 35 years of Left rule, giving hope for a new beginning. For change or 'poribortan'. While Banerjee and her party alone cannot be blamed for continuing political violence,   over communal issues. West Bengal recorded 27 incidents of violence in 2015, in which five people died, while 84 others were injured. The numbers doubled over the next two years. In 2016, four people died and 252 were injured in 32 incidents of communal violence. But the number of communal clashes increased to 58 in 2017 when nine people were killed and 230 injured. Banerjee has been in politics long enough to know that law and order is a state subject and as chief minister, she cannot get away by pinning the blame on BJP alone, for the violence in a state she governs. She stands accused of indulging in   to take on the might of the BJP. The chief minister has been trying to match the BJP with Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti celebrations in the state. While, to begin with, she ordered the police to act against those creating mischief, in 2018, she said old Ram Navami processions which have been carrying weapons for years will be exempt from police action. Trinamool district units in Birbhum and West Midnapore also went on to organise a conference of Hindu priests. Communal clashes in   during Ram Navami festivities underlined the perils of this 'competitive communalism'. It is only obvious that Banerjee went ahead to apparently appease Hindus with greater fervour in 2018, having earlier antagonised a section by pausing  when the occasion clashed with Muharram. None of this is a mark of a 'secular' leader, least of all, someone seeking votes in the name of secularism to counter 'communal forces'. Worse, the chief minister is not known to take jokes or humour well — a trait similar to, well, Hitler? Ambikesh Mahapatra, a Jadavpur University professor,  after he circulated a cartoon poking fun at Banerjee via email. The chief minister, who is fairly well-known for her temper, also called a   for questioning her over the safety and security of women in the state during a television show. Banerjee's anxieity was so deep that a team of the state police actually descended at the TV channel's studio reportedly seeking details of the participants in the programme. Another student had a police complaint filed against him for   on his Facebook account. As Prime Minister, leaders have to face many more questions though. Could Banerjee handle that? While Banerjee has been vocal against the BJP for not providing a safer country for women, her own   don't have much to offer to the country's women, or its men who care for women's safety. The chief minister went so far as to claim that  . When a woman alleged she had been raped on a train in Burdwan, Banerjee called it a lie, alleging the woman ""happens to be the wife of a CPM supporter."" It didn't take long for investigators to find the woman had been widowed 11 years before she was raped. And, if that wasn't enough, the same Banerjee, at a rally in Minakhan, thundered,  Seeking support in the name of 'secularism' against Modi could be Banerjee's nemesis. The chief minister has called for an  . Two months before that rally is held, Banerjee will begin a country-wide tour to drum up support. She is expected to invite Congress president Sonia Gandhi, RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav and his son Tejashwi Yadav, Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav, Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR). Many of these leaders, ironically, all part of a 'secular front', also have ambitions of their own. While KCR and Banerjee have been holding talks to come together as part of a federal front, KCR didn't even heed Banerjee's call for a vote against the BJP during the recent no-confidence motion.

276,Javaid Trali,"The fall of the coalition government in J&K did create a   — but the emergence of a new political discourse could be a good omen for the restive state. The promised politics of inclusiveness and participation drew me towards the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) — formed and led by the late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. I became a part of the party in 2013 officially — only to part ways in disappointment. Following the death of Mufti Saheb, who kept the party together, the reigns of the party were handed to a few, based on their surnames. The rest did not matter. At times, I regretted my decision of being part of a party which did not value individual efforts to strengthen and broaden it. I wore my ideology on my sleeve though and went the extra mile to defend my party through whatever way possible, even risking my life and family. I told our side of the story, boldly and effectively. I found that important, given the fact that I believed in whatever I said. But that did not matter. The party reached a point where there was no internal democracy, and that pushed people like me to the wall. I learnt that the price for loyalty, hard work and honesty can also be paid by humiliation and harassment. The only qualification for growth now was sycophancy. Within the party leadership, deliberations over the way forward transformed into conspiring on how to let each other down and promote individual interests. The politics of the state is complex and the PDP simply increased the people’s anxiety and allowed the state to get polarised, and continue in severe uncertainty. J&K’s politics have been dominated by two parties, rather, just two families — the Abdullahs and the Muftis. With family politics came a premium on surnames and blood lines, whether one was a peer or not. This ensured a pro-people government was never formed. Despite several elections, including those when participation was overwhelming, its dividends never reached the grassroots level. In Jammu and Kashmir, democracy has always been hampered and thwarted by the families who made it a fiefdom. It is, perhaps, among the major causes of alienation of the common Kashmiri from the Indian system of democracy, which they now see as an enabler of corruption, a murderer of merit. The few with premium surnames have hijacked the political process. They have ensured democracy is stifled, corrupted and power is vested in the hands of very few. This anti-people culture has to be dismantled. Now the realization of ridding the turmoil-hit state of this two-party jagirdari has finally dawned on those who have the will and strength to do so. The coming together of the like-minded and the resolve of younger leaders to take on these political families has unnerved the latter. For the families, there can be no bigger threat to their political survival for the process of reviving democracy will dismantle their palaces of nepotism. But will a new political formation be able to salvage democracy from the hands of these families? It is not easy - but these new figures have shown the will to stand their ground. Their lack of mincing words and their public criticism of family politics is courageous. One would hope they are successful in their endeavor of seeing a new leadership. This new leadership must also focus on issues that pertain to the survival of common people, rather wasting time on rhetoric and using a carrot and stick policy to mislead the emotional swathes of Kashmir. There is a Kashmir beyond politics. There is life in little nooks and corners and villages to which roads do not lead, where water and electricity is scarce and people seek azadi from their daily woes. The flak for this lack of deliverance is most often taken by the Indian system, rather than the corrupt family-led parties. And why not, for the face of the political mainstream in Kashmir have been the two families. A decisive leadership, governed by the spirit of democracy, rather than an urge to secure families’ political fortunes, can address these issues. Whatever the secessionists say, one may not agree with them; but those who get elected on the planks of development and economic prosperity, if they talk the same impractical language for their survival, the system, and the people for whom it has been established, is bound to face what it is facing today. That is the reason for the collapse of democratic institutions and the peoples’ trust on them. The mandate of mainstream politicians is limited to governance and administration — they need to understand and respect their role and responsibility. People have been voting, despite threats and intimidation - and those in power have failed the very same people. To hide their failures on these fronts, they raise emotive issues, which are neither their domain, nor can they solve them. Yes, they do have the right to talk about topics like the resolution of the Kashmir issue, the revocation of AFSPA and dialogue with dissenters, but they are duty-bound under oath to work for governance and administration. By not performing their mandated role, they are trying to subvert accountability. This is a norm in J&K since ages, and the state's political families are responsible for that. For example, while presiding over apparently one of the most corrupt and inefficient governments, National Conference leader Omar Abdullah would talk about revoking   every now and then. He would bash India and present it as villain before the people, while trying to come out clean himself.  The same is the case with the previous government too; it wasted most of its time by scaring New Delhi with China, Pakistan and separatists. The results are before us — there has been no change on the ground. In fact, things have gone from  . If these family-run parties would have been truthful to the people and would tell them that whatever happened in 1947 is final, and no matter how lofty our slogans are, how genuine our arguments may seem, geography won’t be changed, the state and its people would not have suffered these unprecedented political, economic and psychological losses. Instead, they reap the benefits of politics and democracy while they have institutionalised hate against India, and cashed in on that hate for their political capital. The mainstream hypocrisy started with Sheikh Abdullah Saheb when he raised the bogey of 'Raishumari Tehreek', after being  . Unfortunately, this practice still continues. The double-speak and lack of sincerity of these politicians have pushed the common man to the wall. Major responsibility for this despondency is on the NC, and of late, the PDP. The level of manipulation and blackmailing practiced by the people in power, over the years, has taken away focus from the real issues that the state is facing. The mainstream politicians have done a great disservice to the idea of democracy, and have lost credibility by increasing the level of expectation of the electorate, and failing to keep their promises. By preferring personal interests, party interests and family interests over the interests of the people, they have disrespected democracy and the trust of people. The result is: - disillusionment and disaffection with the system. This has to be changed. This void has to be filled. The conscientious grouping which we see emerging now seems resolute to make political discourse inclusive and vibrant, and hold family politics accountable. This is not the ultimate solution for our state - but this is the beginning of a process of a purpose. Politics must be separated from the whims and fancies of the political elite, the jagirdars and viceroys - who have been blackmailing both New Delhi and the hapless people of J&K. Let’s be honest to ourselves. Let’s bid good bye to the politics of ransom and blackmailing.",2018-07-22,"Omar Abdullah,Mehbooba Mufti,BJP-PDP break-up,Jammu and Kashmir",End the family drama — dynasty politics has only blackmailed J&K and Delhi,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/how-dynasty-politics-threatened-jammu-and-kashmir-for-ages-abdullah-mufti-centre-political-crisis/story/1/25621.html
277,Gautam Benegal,"In the past four years, since the NDA came to power over hyperbolic promises and slogans, the PM, Mr Narendra Modi, has not held a single press conference to allay the apprehensions of the public over the growing lawlessness and the state of the economy. Neither has he addressed the clamour of voices in the civil society and the media that express the very real fear that in spite of exorbitantly expensive government advertisements and individual feel-good soundbytes from sundry ministers and MPs, the country is in danger of falling apart.  Accusations and complaints have been either ignored, trivialised, or deflected by counter accusations against past governments, whataboutery, and a barrage of nonsensical gaslighting that plays out in an infinite loop.  Given the frustration, the lack of transparency and accountability for such an extended period of time, even after the failure of the government on several fronts in keeping their promises, and the clueless state the public still is in over the bizarre demonetisation that ruined so many businesses and took its toll in lives, it was only a matter of time before things came to a head.  What could have been the reason for the no confidence motion brought in against the government by an Opposition that lacked woefully in numbers, yet persisted, knowing it would surely fail? 154 against 331? The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MP from Guntur, Jayadev Galla, who started the debate in the Parliament, said it was a war against the injustice meted out to the people of Andhra Pradesh. Galla pointed out that that the Modi government had allocated less funds to build Amaravati, projected as Andhra Pradesh’s capital city, than even the money budgeted for the mammoth statue of Sardar Patel. He revealed that barely 2-3 per cent of the funds required had been allocated. When he said that the “saga of Modi-Shah regime has been of unfulfilled promises”, he was speaking not only for the people of Andhra Pradesh, but just about everybody in civil society today.  Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP from Barrackpore, Dinesh Trivedi, deliberately used mythological references (which the BJP RSS is fond of making) when he said, “ ” This was because Pandavas sided with the truth,” (Kauravas were many, yet they were defeated by numerically inferior Pandavas) in an obvious allusion to the superiority of numbers the BJP enjoys in the Lok Sabha. Likening the Modi government to an ostrich that buries its head in the sand, deliberately oblivious to all that is happening around it, he called it a mute spectator to the mobocracy that it has unleashed nationwide.  As if to illustrate his point, in another part of the country, Akbar Khan, a 28-year-old man, was beaten to death at Alwar in Rajasthan by gau rakshaks on suspicion of cow smuggling as he was transporting two cows through a forest area. The lynching came soon after the home minister’s speech saying laws would be made to address mob lynching.  How serious is this government where these lynchings are concerned? Let’s take a look at another similar incident in Always a year ago. Six people identified in   (the victim) dying statement weren't even charge-sheeted. Nine people charged weren't named in the FIR. Seven of nine are out on bail. Two are untraceable. In a counter case, Pehlu Khan has been named as a cow-smuggler despite a valid cow purchase receipt. The no confidence motion was never about the numbers or about winning. It was a disruptive exercise to bring home and expose the lacunae of an unresponsive, impassive government. It was creating an opportunity to be heard in a public darbar of sorts, and forcing the government to respond. It was dragging the horse to the water in the hope that it would drink. But more importantly, it was a concerted attempt to bare these issues in front of a public fed on disinformation and propaganda for the past four years.  As one prominent panelist in a channel put it, it would be exceedingly naïve to expect that there would be any point-to-point rebuttals involving specifics, from the side of the Treasury benches, and he was proved correct.  All these charges have been made before, on separate media channels, in the press, by Opposition leaders, activists, journalists, and they have all met with the same fate — either a wall of silence, or tu quoques and false equivalences. The same clichés have been trotted out, the “where-were- you- whens” and the “seventy years of inactions” and that most multipurpose one (delinked of context), to suit all accusations of every riot and lynching under the stewardship of the Sangh Parivar, from Godhra to the one that took place yesterday. It was almost with a sense of tired déjà vu that one waited for Rajnath Singh to come up with the 1984 Sikh pogrom in answer to the lynchings currently taking place, and he did not disappoint.  Rahul Gandhi raised issues such as the Rafael deal, low employment rate, the Doklam standoff, Modi’s visit to China and its outcome, crony capitalism (where he injudiciously, without concrete proof, called Modi a “bhagidar” — a partner — instead of a “chowkidar (watchman) as the latter had claimed in the past), and the Indian farmer’s plight. What was perhaps superfluous was his jibe that the PM was unable to “meet his eyes” as he made these comments. We know what came later, the hug and the wink which has captured the public imagination and diluted the thrust of the debate. (It is something that one would not wish to explore, as a matter of populist optics that devalues any serious political discourse.) Nevertheless, this rant was probably the most brutal hauling over the coals in full public glare that this regime has had in these past four years.  Rahul’s diatribe is not new. It is a reboot of an earlier speech. On March 18, 2018, during his first major presidential address at the AICC plenary session, Rahul had launched a headlong attack on Modi and Amit Shah, alleging corruption, crony capitalism, and administrative incompetence. He had said, “Modi gives (Nirav) Modi Rs 30,000 crore of your money and, in turn, Modi gives Modi money for marketing Modi and fighting elections.”  As a point of interest, it is to be noted that in the same speech, he had made the same reference to the Mahabharata that Dinesh Trivedi echoed in his address: “Like the Kauravas, the BJP and the RSS are designed to fight for power, but like the Pandavas, the Congress is designed to fight for truth.” Referring to the Rafale deal he had said, “Forget fighter planes, you can’t trust such a man to buy vegetables. Modi is not fighting corruption. Modi is corruption.”  The PM’s response in Parliament followed a tried-and-tested template that most of us are inured to by now. Against the din of “We want justice” by the TDP MPs, Modi rubberbanded back into the familiar theme of deprived subaltern vs landed aristocracy, the inability of a “kaamdhari” to look into the eyes of a “naamdhari” (shades of Harvard vs Hard work there) and a long and monotonous readout from a script after much twiggling of fingers, histrionics, appeal to patriotism, and deconstruction of the hug and wink as an attempt to dethrone him. Or, as a TDP MP pointed out, worthy of a Bollywood film. But the stellar glory of his speech is in his attempt to divide the Opposition. What did the Congress do to Charan Singh Ji, what did they do to Chandra Shekhar Ji, what did they do to Deve Gowda Ji, what did they do to IK Gujral Ji …all the way up to Pranab Mukherjee – with a keen eye towards the TDP ranks, that had deserted the BJP.  History rehashed simplistically, divorced of the surrounding complex context, and weaponised opportunistically has always been the BJP’s mainstay, and trotted out like an old racehorse.  To rebut point by point the various claims that the PM has made from the written portion of his speech (barring the non-written extempore full of invectives and familiar jibes against the Gandhi family) would be an interesting, albeit humongous exercise. But let us examine just a couple of the most obvious “jumlas” as an example of the kind of hype that has become the norm and practice. (Leaving out the claims of vast numbers of “empowered” youth who have become auto drivers and other ennobling lower scale businesses cited as examples by our PM, of a “thriving economy” enabled by the current NDA economy, of course). Exactly how content are the farmers? Around the same time, give or take a few hours when Akbar Khan was getting lynched in Alwar by gau rakshaks, giving lie to our Home Minister’s claims of normalcy, this was taking place giving the lie to our PM’s claims of agrarian bliss. In a show of strength on July 20,  from several states, who had travelled several thousand kilometres under the banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), marched in New Delhi to “express no confidence in the Narendra Modi government”. The protestors alleged that the Modi-led NDA had reneged on all its election promises made to farmers and has attempted to mislead farmers on the issue of minimum support price (MSP). About the claims of 100 per cent electrification of villages all over India, presented as an achievement of the NDA government: The average Indian hardly is privy to how much is on paper and how much is reality on the ground, but here are the facts according to data released by Niti Ayog. Previous governments (beginning from the second five-year plan that had included rural electrification in their aims) had already achieved 97 per cent of electrification up to 2014 with 5,79,012 villages, while only the rest of the 3 per cent — 18,452 villages — in these past 4 years have been done by the NDA.  Probably the biggest achievement in this No Trust Motion has been the examination of the Rafale deal and the distinction that has been made between what is a national security concern involving technicalities of the aircraft and the confidentiality of the monetary transaction between the two governments. The first is understandable, but has no bearing on the second, which is the right of every taxpayer to be aware of, as Arti Jerath pointed out during a discussion in a panel discussion recently. It is the consistent effort on the part of the BJP to conflate the two and impose a veil of secrecy that is suspicious, and this is what has come out to the fore in these proceedings. The NDA may have won in numbers, but the Opposition has achieved its objective in occupying a higher moral ground. The carpet has been well and truly dusted in public in every aspect of this regime’s governance.  The Rafale might well turn out to be the Bofors of this government. Hopefully, it will turn out to be as much of a damp squib as the latter for our Pradhan Pracharak.",2018-07-22,"Rahul Gandhi,Narendra Modi,Parliament,No-confidence motion",What the Opposition achieved with the No Confidence Motion,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/no-confidence-motion-parliament-rahul-gandhi-hugs-modi-bjp-tdp/story/1/25625.html
278,Hamza Ameer,"With the general election in Pakistan just days away (July 25), political parties have intensified their poll campaigning in an attempt to garner support from people, who, they claim, would bring them to power. However, what these political leaders don't seem to realise in their excitement is that they might be sharing their elected seats with some of the most-dreaded designated terrorist organisations internationally. That's because apart from the political parties in fray, there is a massive number of candidates from the Milli Muslim League (MML), the political front of 26/11 Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed, contesting the polls. The MML has fielded at least  candidates for the Provincial and National Assembly seats from across Pakistan. Initially, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) refused to register the MML as a political party, as it failed to get security clearance from the Federal Ministry of Interior due to serious reservations over its founder Hafiz Saeed, who has a US $10 million bounty on his head besides being enlisted in the UNSC terror list. The MML still managed to field its candidates under the umbrella of Allah-o-Akbar Tehreek (AAT), a relatively unknown political party. Interestingly, Hafiz Saeed, his organisation Jamat-ud-Dawa (JUD) and political front Milli Muslim League, has been enslited in global terror groups list by Washington and have been on Pakistan’s terror watch also. Despite the ban and checks on the JUD chief, Hafiz Saeed has been campaigning for his party candidates.Travelling to major cities across Pakistan, Hafiz Saeed is openly participating and addressing public gatherings. Even though Saeed has been the prime reason for Pakistan’s insertion into the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which grilled the country for failing to crack down on Saeed and his organisation, the Pakistan government continues to allow Saeed to hold election rallies across the country. Political observers, however, insist the general election 2018 and the people of Pakistan have no space or appetite for Saeed or his candidates as these elections are primarily seen as a contest among PML-N, the PTI and the PPP. With the Sharif family in jail and an already struggling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the MML considers this elections as its big entry into the political setup of Pakistan. But analysts also believe that chances of MML candidates winning from any of the constituencies look slim. They, however, also add that if the MML is able to bag even one seat it will be a massive victory for Hafiz Saaed – the first step towards mainstreaming terror outfits in Pakistani politics.",2018-07-20,"Army,Nawaz Sharif,Hafiz Saeed,Pakistan general elections",How rules were twisted to mainstream Hafiz Saeed's terror outfit in Pakistan politics,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pakistan-general-elections-hafiz-saeed-milli-terrorism-muslim-league-nawaz-sharif-imran-khan-army-india/story/1/25591.html
279,Akshaya Nath,"With 37 MPs in the Lok Sabha, the  has largely been a fence-sitter maintaining a cordial relationship with the Centre, but not taking a clear stand either.  In Tamil Nadu, people's dislike for the BJP was clearly seen in the recent past with protests on social media with hashtags such as #GoBackModi and #GoBackAmitShah trending on Twitter. But then governments are not run on Twitter. Being the third-largest party in the lower house in Parliament, the AIADMK has been nudged by Opposition parties in the state to vote against the BJP during Friday's no-confidence motion. 
 
 
 
 “We hope the 37 MPs of the AIADMK remember that they are first and foremost representatives of the people of Tamil Nadu and they should give voice to the concerns of the people who live and reside in Tamil Nadu. It is with that hope we have asked the AIADMK to take a position supporting the no-confidence motion,” said Manu Sundaram, DMK spokesperson. Raising allegations that the BJP failed to deliver its promises, Sundaram added, “PM Modi came with a promise that he will give Rs 15 lakh in everyone's bank account, will generate one crore new jobs every year and bring back black money stashed abroad. But what has he done? He has imposed demonetisation, he has thrust GST in an improper manner and he has foisted the NEET and 15th Finance Commission on states against their wishes. So, it has been a government that has gone against the interest of Tamil Nadu as well as the rest of the country.  ""We hope the AIADMK supports the no-confidence motion. But given the quid pro quo between the AIADMK and the BJP in Tamil Nadu, I don’t see it happening and that ultimately is something that the people of Tamil Nadu will not forget.” Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) had earlier said that the AIADMK will not support the  to highlight its own issues, and noted that there was no one who supported Tamil Nadu when the Cauvery issue was raised in Parliament.  A few months back when Tamil Nadu was on the boil over Cauvery, the AIADMK had said that if there was a no-confidence motion moved it would vote in favour of the motion. But times have changed now. According to senior journalist Radhakrishnan, ""The AIADMK will do as the BJP tells them to. EPS is saying this to negotiate with the Centre, or could be because of the I-T raids. But it has nothing to do with the welfare of Tamil Nadu. Even in Cauvery matter, it was not like the Centre took a stand that was in favour of Tamil Nadu. Taking all this into consideration and the fact that the Centre has not done anything for the state so far, the AIADMK should actually support the motion. But EPS and O Panneerselvam (OPS) will be unable to do so because they are completely governed by Delhi.” The DMK too though urged the AIADMK to make a better choice and make use of the opportunity in the Assembly, saw the AIADMK as an agent acting on behalf of the BJP.  “The AIADMK today is very different from the AIADMK that we had seen in the past. People in Tamil Nadu now feel the AIADMK as an extension of the BJP. The regional giant has extended support to the Centre in a number of issues that have gone against the interest of the people in Tamil Nadu. Today, when there is a no-confidence motion, the AIADMK is dilly-dallying and will finally say they will lot back the no-confidence motion,” added Sundaram. Meanwhile, as all eyes are on the AIADMK, senior party leader and fisheries minister D Jayakumar said, “Yesterday the CM indicated no support for the no-confidence motion. He clearly stated we will not support it. It's a BJP versus TDP fight. The Congress versus BJP. Why should we support. This is not necessary for us. No rebellion among MPs. we have given instructions. Based on that MP will act in Parliament. Let's wait and see.” What added to the political chaos was Supreme Court's decision on Friday (July 20) to stay the Madras High Court directive to the CBSE to grant grace marks to students who suffered from the erroneous Tamil translation of 49 questions in the  (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) for undergraduate medical admissions.  While the NEET has been consistently opposed by the Tamil Nadu government right from its conceptualisation in the past decade,  the state, cutting across party lines, feels the Centre (on this issue) is “ignoring” the regional aspirations and interests of people.

280,Sahil Joshi,"How many potholes are there on Mumbai's over  of roads? The answer is: God knows! Even by a conservative estimate, which happens to be official data, there are around 300-odd potholes still to be filled across roads ""maintained"" by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Public Works Department (PWD) and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). Although it's the BMC that is mainly on the receiving end of people's ire, the PWD, the MMRDA and other municipalities in the MMR are equal ""stakeholders"". This year alone, potholes have claimed six lives. 
 
 On July 18, a 35-year-old woman landed in the hospital after she fell off her bike and sustained multiple head injuries, after allegedly hitting a pothole outside Tardeo police station. 
 
 On July 9, a 40-year-old woman was crushed to death after she fell off a bike in the waterlogged roads of Kalyan and was was thrown in front of a speeding bus. She died on the spot. Even though the  minister feels that potholes alone can't be blamed for these deaths, the pockmarked roads that lay in front of us clearly show why bikers lose control of their vehicles and fall down. The city is so sick of talking about potholes that the deep-gaping gashes are no longer called that.While newspapers long back started calling them ""giant craters"", even the civic department last year decided to replace the term with  . Of course, the name change hasn't made a difference in the lives of Mumbaikars. Instead, the problem is only getting worse. And now that the season of potholes is on us again, there is no escaping the ravages. The city's first tryst with the ""pothole epidemic"" was in the 1990s, but with time and ever-increasing vehicular traffic, the problem has increased manifold. At one point, one of the solutions offered was to replace the asphalt road surface with concrete, since the latter is considered more durable. With that in mind, the civic authorities decided to take on the humongous task of converting the roads from asphalt to concrete. But reconstruction of roads requires a number of no-objection certifcates from various departments for road diversions, closure of lanes to vehicular traffic etc. So far, the government has managed to complete only 40 per cent to 50 per cent of the target. The rest of the roads are still asphalt-surfaced. So, these roads need resurfacing every two-three years to keep them in working condition. Last year, the BMC spent Rs 1,700 crore for resurfacing of roads, but the rains washed away most of the shoddy make-up. Then there is the constant digging of roads for purposes like laying underground power lines, broadband cables, and water pipes, making matters worse. On top of that, there is no coordination between water supply agencies, electricity discoms, telephone companies, piped gas companies as well as the Metro rail authorities. Poor management between authorities and service providers is making life more and more difficult for the ordinarty citizens. There is always some or the other agency digging up roads at various places across Mumbai. Last year, the BMC decided to punish contractors for shoddy road work and identified six big names in the road construction business. The BMC's move to blacklist contractors and file cases against them was welcomed by many, thinking this would act as a warning to others trying to fool the government. Interestingly, all the ""blacklisted"" contractors got anticipatory bail even before the police could lay hands on them. One of the contractors later even bagged a major contract for Metro construction by the MMRDA. The BMC has been trying to ""blacklist"" contractors for a long time now, but has failed miserably. Often, contractors don't even bother to follow the road designs made on the basis of traffic intensity and other data as suggested by special consultants. On other occasions, the basic requirement of four layers of construction (material) used to make roads durable is blatantly overlooked. There was a time when the BMC had its own asphalt testing laboratories to detect sub-standard materials used in road construction. But these labs are no longer in operation. Now, contractors need to get a certificate from private labs approved by the BMC. Which speaks a lot about the control over contractors and their activities. For routine maintenance, pothole-riddled roads need 60mm-62mm layer of asphalt resurfacing, but most contractors get away with quick fixes of 20mm-25mm layers. The BMC even started a pothole-tracking system wherein one could click a picture of potholes and upload it on its website. The website also had the provision to ascertain the exact measurement of the potholes. This was also used to keep a tab on contractors who were given the responsibility to fill up those potholes. The tracking system, however, was shut down more than a year ago as it created more chaos than solving the purpose. If this is the situation in Mumbai, imagine the plight of residents in Kalyan, Dombivali, Vasai, Virar, Thane and Navi Mumbai, which have their own municipal corporations now. As expected, civic amenities in these areas are as bad as Mumbai, if not worse. , where five people died this year due to accidents owning to potholes and bad roads, is the worst affected. Interestingly, all these areas are part of the Centre's much-hyped Smart City project. Well, till the time the politician-bureaucrat-contractor nexus continues to pocket money for roads never built and potholes never filled, India's smart city dreams will remain a ""dumb"" project.",2018-07-20,"Monsoon,BMC,Potholes,Mumbai",Why Centre's 'Smart City' dreams for Mumbai continue to stare at gaping potholes,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mumbai-potholes-deaths-bmc-mmrda-pwd-smart-city-civic-negligence-devendra-fadnavis/story/1/25578.html
281,Arindam De,"Shashi Tharoor's language skills are beyond brilliant. The problem is that he might not be properly understood by his readers or the audience. Probably, not even by the “opinion forming” 6pm debates, sizzling and elevating, which pay unique tribute to the freedom of expression in the land every day! The Congress leader, in all fairness, was doing his job — expressing grave concern about what will happen to the minorities, if the ruling front returns to power. The howl of protests that went up was on expected lines — opinions are voiced to evoke reactions. Similar opposition was voiced to ex-VP Hamid Ansari's suggestion that Sharia courts can be allowed to function as different communities have different rules. He was of the view that as our laws recognise that each community can have its own rules, there should be bodies to arbitrate those laws. The problem is that such bodies have no legal sanction. It is difficult to “see” what he meant, but the message is clear. There are a few issues with such a line of thought: It applies to only one community, a community that has been ruthlessly exploited by the so-called secular parties for their votes. A casual look at the highlights of Justice Sachar's report would be adequate to understand their condition. Equality and secularism, as enshrined in our hallowed book, has few takers. Everyone swears by them and nobody cares about them. They are sacrificed, almost daily, at the altar of politics, casteism, religion, purchasing power and what not. If you live in one of our towns or villages, interact with people — common people going about their common ways — you shall find more reverence and belief among them than you see among our leaders. Cities are way too big and crowded to display homogeneous sentiments.  A Uniform Civil Code would not only ease the burden on the legal system, it would qualify legal equality for all, irrespective of their religions. It would gradually weed out the negativities in the personal laws of the communities. Such a probability excites the intelligence of the young, educated, opinionated people, the majority of our population. In a dispassionate analysis, you can find a lot of shortcomings in the present dispensation's “rule”. Playing the politics of division can be one such charge. But then, in a country of such diverseness, any divisive policy would lead to automatic counter-mobilisation. BJP has only cashed in on it. But what is the primary opposition party doing? Attacking a party for endangering India's secular fabric, then defending personal laws, advocating non-interference on personal laws of communities and insinuating that BJP is turning India into Hindu Pakistan ruled by Hindu Taliban is something very contradictory. Time and again, BJP has shown that it would latch on to every opportunity to further its cause. Home minister Rajnath Singh, while addressing Parliament on the No-Confidence motion, slammed the comments on Hindu Taliban and Hindu Pakistan, without naming Tharoor. He tacitly attributed it to the Congress party, which shows that the party is primed for Lok Sabha 2019 and the Congress is either too relaxed or careless in its approach. Every voter is definitely not supportive of all of BJP’s policies, actions, or the lack of. While the BJP has always spoken about one law for all and Congress has championed secularism, any departure may have political costs in the long run. Different set of rules for different communities automatically prove BJP's charge that Congress is not truly secular. Similarly, talking about inclusive development and leaving out one-fifth of the population is not a fair game. Besides, personal laws of many other communities contain antiquated clauses that must be restructured or removed — for the sake of equality.",2018-07-20,"BJP,Narendra Modi,Congress,Shashi Tharoor",Congress is full of dilemmas.

282,Sushant Sareen,"Around the world there is great interest, and some concern, over the participation of the Islamist terror groups and extremist sectarian parties in the general elections in Pakistan. The Pakistani authorities defend the entry of the jihadists in the political sphere on the grounds that they are mainstreaming the fanatics to moderate them and wean them away from militancy and terrorism. Of course, this is true only in theory because if the rhetoric at the hustings of the fanatics is anything to go by, far from the jihadists being mainstreamed, the mainstream is being jihadised. Does India need to worry about the emerging trend in Pakistani politics? Not really. In many ways, the entry of the fanatics won’t significantly change the seven-decade-old paradigm of Pakistan in relation to India. Cut through the claptrap, and it is clear that regardless of whether India deals with ISI or its ""plural"" ISIS, the fundamental “inimicalness” of the Pakistani state towards India will remain the same. If anything, Pakistan achieving its manifest destiny of becoming the Islamic State it has longed to become, will be good for India because not only will it show Pakistan’s real face to rest of the world, it will also remove the rose-tinted glasses with which a section of Indians look at Pakistan. With the Hafiz Saeeds or Khadim Rizvis calling the shots in Islamabad, Delhi will hopefully no longer get fooled or lulled by the forked tongue of the “civil society” of Pakistan and will know exactly what and who they are dealing with. More than Indians, it is Pakistani elite which needs to be concerned over the deep inroads made by the Islamist groups in Pakistani politics. The sort of hypocrisy the Pakistani elite has been indulging in — living it up behind high walls but spouting Islamist bombast in public — will become more difficult. For the rest of the people, they will adjust to the Islamists. Most Pakistanis have no real problem with what the jihadists stand for; their problem is with the manner in which the Islamists seek to impose and implement their world view. In other words, most Pakistanis are okay with the madness of the radicals, not so much with their methods. And this is also true of almost all political parties which are merrily, even proudly, going ahead and making local-level adjustments with the most radical and reactionary jihadist parties. The announcement by Asad Umar, the man tipped to be the next finance minister of Pakistan, that a notorious terrorist, Fazlur Rehman Khalil of Harkat-ul-Ansar/Harkat-ul-Mujahideen fame, had joined Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaaf is a prime example of the trajectory which Pakistani politics is following. But it isn’t only PTI. Almost all other parties have struck Faustian bargains with one or the other radical Islamist parties. Leaders and candidates have been virtually prostrating themselves before the leaders of the extremist Sunni party Ahle-Sunnat-wal-Jamaat (ASWJ), the new avatar of the Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, seeking their support in their constituencies, especially in Punjab and Karachi. Similar has been the case with Lashkar-e-Taiba’s political wing, Milli Muslim League (MML) and the extremist Barelvi Muslim party, Tehrik-e-LabbaikPakistan (TLP) which has incidentally put up more candidates than the PPP in the Punjab Assembly elections. The political muscle-flexing by the radical Islamists, coupled with the way established parties are sucking up to them, has more or less normalised the entry of terrorists into the political arena. There are a few carping sounds from the endangered species of Pakistani liberals (a tiny fringe group more visible on social media than on the street) but otherwise there is quiet acquiescence to the entry of jihadists in electoral politics. A big reason for this is of course fear. Everyone is scared of these groups, including the judges who are quick to book politicians for contempt but are terrified of taking on the extremists who openly hurl the vilest abuses on them. The fear among the politicians is palpable. Despite the fact the TLP isn’t known to have a jihadist cadre like the MML, its workers have hurled a shoe at former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, smeared the face of former foreign minister Khawaja Asif with ink, and shot former interior minister Ahsan Iqbal. The MML and the ASWJ are capable of far worse. No one, therefore, wants to get on the wrong side of any of these groups. While none of the radical parties are likely to win more than a handful of seats, it will be interesting to see the number of votes they garner, individually as well as collectively. But in many ways, even the votes they get won’t be the correct metric to judge the tectonic shift their entry into the electoral arena has effected in Pakistani politics. Even with only a token representation and minimum number of votes, their street power enabled them to exercise a virtual veto over any progressive or sensible step that any government wanted to take. But now in addition to street power, they have been given political legitimacy. This means that instead of measuring their political importance in terms of the electoral performance, it needs to be measured in terms of their emergence as power brokers and players, and the long-term impact of this on the political scene in Pakistan. Apart from the normal quid pro quo that is part and parcel of politics, the established parties will also have to put up with the reactionary demands and the bullying of these parties on a range of issues. If anything, these elections could well see Pakistan coming a step closer to its manifest destiny and starting the process of transition from being an imperfect Islamic Republic to becoming a pristine Islamic State (the pun is entirely intended).

283,Ifra Jan,"Many many years ago, when the debate over Sati in colonial India was intensifying, some called for immediate abolition, others for a reconsideration, some for continuation. But going back to those debates, what strikes even an amateur reader is how the “women’s position” was central to the political discourse of civilisations, where each claimed a moral authority over the other based on how their respective societies treated “their” women. Years later, Lata Mani, in her remarkable book,   was to tell us how the intriguing debates were not only to protect the beings and the bodies of women, but were rather held over them. Today, we, the Muslim women, find ourselves at a similar trajectory in the history of ourselves, which we seldom got to read, let alone write. As I switch on the TV, a long-bearded Mullah is contentiously putting forth a case for “Sharia courts”. These are nothing but “arbitration bodies”, he claims, as the anchor shouts him down to say, “What about our secularism?” Muslim women’s rights today are the heart of the Left-Right whirlpool our country is swirling in. But where are the women? They form 0.3 per cent of our Parliament and around 8 per cent of our population. So, Muslim women, whose “rights” take up most of our TRP wars on our TV screens, hardy feature in Parliamentary discussions themselves, where laws are made and formulated to protect and “save” them. We are used as props by political parties across the spectrum to showcase their desire to “save” us. Often, many of the groups that speak the loudest for the rights of Muslim women have candid confessions to make. “If Hindu men had to give up their authority over their women, why not Muslim men?” It is not us, ladies and gentlemen, but it is men fighting among themselves. Where are the Muslim women's voices? Silenced. Shunned by their own for speaking up. Driven out of family functions. Boycotted for being “feminists”, hated by their own families. Muslim societies often encourage men to speak on the issues that directly affect women, but they also brutally censor women who speak for themselves. Think of Taslima Nasreen, who does not have a home. Qandeel Baloch, who does not have a life. Asma Jahangir, who struggled all of her life for those her country had let down. Political parties often bypass such women for the fear of losing community support. Their silence is then entrenched by society and stamped by people in power. It is a “democratic” arrangement, where the subaltern of the subaltern cannot speak, is deliberately silenced. It is this cosy set-up that the informal “arbitration councils”, or Sharia courts, will cement. How many women will have a choice to pen down appeals to take their fights to the formal judiciary? How many will continue the fight where secondary victimisation is a hallmark of both the formal and the informal justice system in India? Who do these “arbitration centres” primarily benefit? Informal courts —Panchayats, all-male mohalla committees — are a reality of India that urban upbringing can shield one from. Instead of a serious consideration of how to make the liberal promises of Indian Constitution trickle down to every Muslim woman, the question is, should we formalise the cultural religious codes? The answer is no. Yet, it took the word “Sharia” for our country to acknowledge that a parallel system of judiciary has existed in India. Not the plight of the Muslim women, but a perceived “Islamisation of the country” woke them up. And the contest over our bodies began. It was never about us. No one is talking about the reform Indian lower courts have to be subjected to if justice for women is indeed a priority. A theft case in India can take years, a divorce case even longer. How many women in the middle or lower-middle class, in urban and rural India, have the time and financial resources to go through years of judicial and legal arbitration over a maintenance case? Our divorce laws are equally regressive. Judges have to be convinced that a case for divorce exists, as one partner holds the other hostage and the emotional and/or physical violence continues. Women often choose suicide. And some may well choose the new “arbitration centres”. At least, whatever it delivers, it delivers quick. Sharia courts or not, Muslim women will not get justice unless the lower judiciary is sensitised to their plight. Currently, helping Muslim women organise and speak for themselves, and not hijack their struggles to incorporate these in your political agendas, would be a good start. Muslim liberals are probably the loneliest people on this planet today. Azra Muzzafar's case in Delhi highlighted this helplessness and desperation to belong. A fight that   ended in a complaint where she was referred to as a “jihadi, Islamist, engaging in shady activities”. Meanwhile, the comments from home, Kashmir, from her fellow brethren, were full of disgust and contempt as well, at the clothes she was wearing. Most outrightly welcomed her getting beaten up on the road. “This is not who a Muslim woman is supposed to be”, screamed both sides. Those of us who choose sides, outright, are also left speechless on the “conflicting” identities of us as “Women” and us as “Muslims”. Shehla Rashid, for instance, can be very vocal when a lynching happens, she can take many selfies with Najeeb’s mother, and Shazia Ilmi on the “Sharia courts”, and she can host dinners for Shah Bano. But speaking outright for the rights of Muslim women gets you pushed to the Right. It is seen to be helping to strengthen the rising Right in the world. “Our rights can wait, but the Right has to be halted, if not defeated,” whispers the Left.  Thus begins another battle over our bodies and our voices. The depriotisation of our rights by the champions of liberalism has left us far lonelier, if not abandoned. Recently, the civil rights group Southern Poverty Law Centre called British activist and politician   He most likely faces a family boycott, a social boycott. It did not matter that he was pushing for the rights of minorities within minorities. All that mattered was that his activism was not helping the Left. Lawyers associated with the Left in India today argue for the continuation of female genital mutilation among the Bohra community. A three-year-old girl’s body belongs to no subaltern, neither does her voice resonate anywhere in our contemporary feminist readings. The Right that is now politically championing our cause does not give much of a consideration to our suggestions, voices and demands either. How many ground-level Muslim women organisations were consulted before pushing for the Triple Talaq bill? When was the last time the Right genuinely held a conference, a public consultation to know and understand what we were facing, rather than telling us where our emancipation lay? When was it that we were truly heard by the Right? The Left rejoices in our silence, the Right wants our bodies as selfie props. In this entrenched dichotomy of Left vs Right, most of us stay quiet — and unheard. But organising, and supporting Muslim women to speak for ourselves, begins with you. And so does giving our voices an audience. When Gayatri Spivak in her most thought-provoking piece asks, “Can the Subaltern speak?”, I scream, Yes, we can! Yes, we will!",2018-07-19,"Right,Left-liberals,Triple Talaq,Nikah Halala",Tugged Left and Right: The Muslim Woman is cynically claimed by all,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/triple-talaq-muslim-women-nikah-halala-left-right-sharia-courts-maulanas/story/1/25560.html
284,Kriti M Shah,"In May 2018, the National Assembly of Pakistan in an unprecedented show of political consensus passed a constitutional amendment, making way for the merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) with the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). FATA, situated along the Afghan border in the northwest part of the country, has long been treated and governed differently than other provinces. Governed by a colonial set of judicial laws and ravaged by the Afghan jihad and Islamic radicalism, FATA is one of the most backward, dangerous places on the planet — home to leaders of global terrorist groups. When Mohammed Ali Jinnah first visited FATA after the creation of Pakistan, his vision for the region was to not interfere with the tribal autonomy and he thus retained the British-era legal structures. The   (FCR) is a set of laws that the British enacted in 1901. It was continued by the Pakistani government after 1947. It gave the government and the military the power they needed to virtually rule FATA how they wanted, without any judicial oversight or constitutional congruence. Over the years and particularly since the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the military has conducted a number of operations in the tribal region. Residents of the region have, for years, been subjected to large-scale arrests, kidnappings, questionable interrogation techniques, discriminate questioning of Pashtuns and  by security officials. The operations have targeted foreign fighters and groups that are a threat to Pakistani society, and have ignored all others. This skewed ideology has resulted in operations being ill-planned, poorly implemented and not successful. Not only did they fail to dislodge local militants and stop cross-border infiltration, but they also resulted in militants fleeing to parts of Balochistan, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. All of this has alienated the local population and led to a deep trust deficit between citizens and the state-military apparatus. While over the years there have been a number of ideas and proposals for the mainstreaming of FATA, the lack of political consensus and military support for the same has meant that FATA remains backward and underdeveloped. The Pakistan army vision of FATA as a vital region in the country’s skewed and absurd national security policy towards Afghanistan has meant that it has not supported the idea of a major reformation of FATA until now. The timing of the rare parliamentary consensus on mainstreaming FATA therefore has been noteworthy. Since January 2018, an organic, grassroots movement, fuelled by the  of an innocent 27-year-old man by the military, has taken shape in FATA. The   (PTM) has now become a cross-country series of non-violent, peaceful protests. The PTM asks for an end to the army policy of harassment, and justice for those who have been wrongly killed. Consisting primarily of Pakistani Pashtuns, the ability of the movement to pull large crowds in all parts of the country against the state has demonstrated the power of the Pashtun community — a group that has been stereotyped as militants and terrorists. The pressure created by the movement on the army cannot be ignored. Its narrative, that accuses the military of its forceful presence in FATA, has received a great deal of international attention, while domestic news has remained controlled. While the merger of the regions is important, it is, by no stretch of the imagination, a final solution for solving Pakistan’s militancy problem. As FATA and KP become one, the militants and radicals living in the tribal region will become the bane for the provincial security forces. The government and military have not offered any ideas as to how the engrained militancy in the region, fuelled by the Afghan insurgency, will be dealt with. The merger does perhaps reflect the idea that the military has realised the best way to deal with militants is in a constitutionally mandated format. And while a merger has the potential to provide the residents with their overdue political representation and civil and judicial rights, it is not any end to Pakistan’s problems until they can confront the root causes of its militancy problem.

285,Lokpria Vasudevan,"Given Tamil Nadu's volatile political situation, actor Rajinikanth 's political debut was well-timed. On the last day of 2017, the actor became the biggest newsmaker of the year. Fans lapped up his announcement, Twitter buzzed with wishes from celebrities and his cynics finally had an answer to the 'will he, won't he' question that has dominated the state for over 20 years. Six months on, the contrast between Rajinikanth seen on the big screen and Rajinikanth the politician is stark in several ways. Rajinikanth is undoubtedly a darling of the masses, a status carefully built by playing roles that largely featured him as a messiah on-screen. Rajinikanth's films have always had commercially viable scripts, which have often portrayed him questioning the establishment and fighting for the rights of the working class. In the evergreen classic   (1995), Rajini excelled in the role of a don who helps his community in typical Robinhood style. In   (2007), the actor stands up against the corrupt. Even in the iconic   (1978), his character Kali, a winch operator with utter contempt for the elite, is easily relatable to the working middle-class. While some Tamil nationalist parties often point to his Maharashtrian and Kannadiga roots, perhaps as a riposte, you have his recent films like   and   where he fights for the upliftment of the Tamil community, standing by and encouraging his people to fight against the exploiters. All these roles have been in stark contrast to the superstar's real life politics. Unlike cinema, there are no second takes in politics, perception is the key. With repeated references to spiritual politics, coupled with the actors take on recent events such   for the Tuticorin violence, it makes one wonder if he is toeing the line of the ruling BJP at the Centre. Take for instance, Rajinikanth 's views on the Centre's idea to conduct   for Lok Sabha and state assemblies. While, the Opposition parties in Tamil Nadu have said it will decimate the federal structure of our country, the actor has extended support to the proposal saying it would save time and money. ""Holding polls together is definitely a welcome move. It should come. Everyone should welcome it. It will save time and money. I hope all the political parties appreciate the advantage and extend their support,"" Rajinikanth said. The central government even found support from the actor on the   that has been a bone of contention in the state. Rajinikanth welcomed the project and called it necessary for the development and growth of the country, but added that people whose farmland is acquired for the project should be adequately compensated. Rajinikanth said, ""Big projects like these will help create jobs and provide opportunities for people. While there will be people who oppose the project, the government should ensure that adequate compensation is provided."" The actor's Tuticorin visit to meet those injured in the May 22 violence set the stage for an analysis of Rajinikanth  — the politician. From facing   injured in the Tuticorin police firing to losing his cool at a press briefing, the superstar trended for all the wrong reasons. While most parties condemned the police firing in Tuticorin, many saw Rajinikanth 's statement as a reflection of the BJP's position on the issue. Rajinikanth 's close association with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP's eagerness to get actor on its side is not lost on the people of the state. On several occasions the actor has called the Prime Minister a ""good friend"". Modi has visited Rajinikanth twice in Chennai in recent times. It is not going to be easy for the superstar to convince his electorate that he is indeed the harbinger of change for Tamil Nadu.

286,Amarnath K Menon,"Will stonewalling of the proceedings of Parliament by the Telugu Desam Party be a feature of the monsoon session opening on July 18? Prospects are high considering that the ruling party in Andhra Pradesh is seeking wide support to move a no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government as part of its strategy to step up campaign on the state being denied Special Category Status (SCS) following the reorganisation of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh in 2014. The TDP had earlier moved a no-confidence motion during the budget session in March. The party had also accused the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance of not allocating enough funds for Andhra Pradesh in the Union Budget this year. Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan refused to take up the notices for the no-confidence motion citing that the House was not in order. State chief minister and TDP strongman N Chandrababu Naidu has again sought to move the no-confidence motion against the Centre’s failure to grant SCS. “I wish to bring to your notice the grave injustice caused to Andhra Pradesh due to inconsistencies in the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014 and non-implementation of the assurances made by the then Prime Minister on the floor of the Rajya Sabha on February 20, 2014,” Naidu said in a letter to political parties. Naidu said it was unfortunate to note that the BJP-led NDA government did not even “respect its 2014 election manifesto relating to Seemandhra”. Disinterest in the implementation of the assurances and promises by the NDA government has led to severe hardships to the people of Andhra Pradesh, Naidu alleged. The CM said in view of the continued “adamant attitude of the BJP-led NDA government”, the TDP has decided to move a no-confidence motion against the Modi government. Significantly, the Congress has accepted the TDP’s request for support and said the no-confidence motion will be deliberated upon by the Congress Parliamentary Party before a decision is taken. The TDP, which pulled out of the NDA in March this year, by reaching out to 18 regional parties, including the TRS in Telangana and the AIMIM in Hyderabad, is going all out to canvass support and getting it too. There will be wider support for the Naidu’s plan considering that even members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, at their first meeting on July 13, slammed the Modi government for not fulfiling any of the provisions made as part of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Former home minister P Chidambaram, chairman of the standing committee, berated the bureaucrats for their lackadaisical approach in making a presentation which had few details and for giving “incoherent replies” to the questions posed by the members. As the presentation had no new information other than what is already in the public domain they asked for a fresh presentation with definitive details and calling Andhra Pradesh government representatives to the next meeting. All this is grist for Naidu’s mill in pitching his demand for a better deal to Andhra Pradesh and keeping the issue alive in garnering support during the elections in 2019. But the challenge will be in finding sustainable ways to walk his talk.

287,Makarand R Paranjape,"I finally got to see   on a flight to the US. This 2017 political, or should I say journalistic thriller, ably directed by Steven Spielberg, tells the heroic saga of how a great American newspaper stood up against the might of the US state and the Nixon White House. At the heart of the tale is the story of how   publisher-owner, Katherine Graham, once considered the most powerful woman in the 20th century, and Ben Bradlee, its executive editor, publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971. Thus, they live up to the Post slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness” still on its masthead. Graham and Bradlee are brilliantly played by Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks respectively. The sub-theme is a gender bender: Graham as a sensitive woman in a man’s world slowly finds the inner strength to stand up for what is right and assert her authority in her own organisation. Bradlee, the spunky and passionate newspaper man, is quite insensitive to his wife, herself a gifted artist, who ends up with her home invaded by reporters and reduced to supplying them food and drink as they work on the biggest breaking story of the year. It is another matter the subject was already, if not as famously, portrayed in an earlier TV film, The Pentagon Papers (2003), or that the heroism of   is in itself somewhat inaccurate and at the expense of  , which broke the story and began publishing the papers first. The Pentagon Papers showed how the White House was lying to the American people about the Vietnam War. In pleading their First Amendment rights before the Supreme Court, the two top papers of the nation were struggling to uphold the foundational and fundamental principles of American democracy. That they won, with a 6-3 ruling in their favour, is the stuff dreams are made of. The film, in a sense, is the prequel to the much bigger Watergate expose that occurred one year later and brought down the Nixon presidency. The heroism of the free press against an authoritarian government had its echoes in India too, in that same decade, as great editors like Arun Shourie of Ramanth Goenka’s   stood up against Indira Gandhi’s Emergency. , has an eerie resonance in today’s US when terms such as “truth decay”, “post truth”, not to mention “fake news” and “alternate facts” have entered common parlance. It is ironic, however, that the film celebrates the grittiness of the Graham family, especially how it saved a great American institution, when the family had already sold the paper in 2013 to Jeff Bezos of Amazon for $250 million. Even under the new ownership, however, great American newspapers continue their skewed “crisis coverage” when it comes to India. Recently, their foreign correspondents have come under fire for egregiously prejudiced and one-sided reporting. So against India’s current ruling dispensation, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, they often cast him in the same mould as Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin. In turn, there’s much teeth-gnashing, if not virtue signalling, when they are mercilessly trolled by right-wing social media warriors. Even when it comes to Indian voices in the Western media, however, the fact remains that the top newspapers seem to only give space to Left-liberal writers. The problem is that current Western coverage of India is part of deeply entrenched decades, if not centuries, old discourse. We remain an erotised and exotised “other”, strange, savage, barbarous, and ultimately incomprehensible. To be mocked or condescended to, as in  , a film that won the Oscar sweepstakes, but flopped in India. We ourselves, those of us who are patronised by Western media houses, play along, with our self-deprecating whiney or overtly self-hating diatribes, bemoaning democracy in danger or peddling some other doom-and-gloom tale. The most internationally acclaimed of these narratives,   (1981), was explicitly written as the requiem to India when Mrs Indira Gandhi declared Emergency in 1975. However, like most other India observers, Salman Rushdie, its author, was proven wrong. Indian democracy, let alone India, did not die. Rushdie had to invent another narrative device, that of Saleem Saini’s adopted son, Aadam, who is exactly three when the novel ends in 1980, thus leaving it to him to tell the story of post-1977 and post-Emergency India. Several years back, when I was a more active reviewer of books, I critiqued   (1990) by Elisabeth Bumiller. Then a reporter for   and wife of Steven R Weisman, the   bureau chief in India, Bumiller’s boo, from its very title, irritated me. Sati, bride burning, pre-natal sex-determination, female foeticide, arranged marriages and, of course, Bollywood were part of its shallow and stereotypical wares. It was, predictably, hailed as a boldly illuminating and hard-hitting feminist portrait of Indian womanhood. Little seems to have really changed since then in the dominant narrative. What has changed, however, quite drastically, is that Indians, once merely meek native informants, now empowered by social media, are actually hitting back, producing counternarratives that are even more visible and powerful. The result? A massive delegitimisation of the dominant. It is not something that is easy to stomach, but hey, the times they are a-changing.

288,Geeta Mohan,"Last week, when it came to light that the Sharif father-daughter duo will be returning to Pakistan to court arrest, there was a lot of speculation on what exactly this would mean for the PML (Nawaz) party and the Sharif family? Was this the beginning of the end? Is this what the Pakistani Army wanted or were they stumped by the genius of Nawaz Sharif? Or, was this the master stroke that was needed for yet another PML(N) wave? To begin with, the singling out of one political party, the concerted effort in its persecution, show that the establishment in Pakistan wanted Nawaz out of the equation ahead of the elections. It is also not untrue that Imran Khan is the blue-eyed boy of the Pakistani Army, the “PM select”, as Bilwalal Zardari Bhutto put it when he was stopped from going to Peshawar to attend a campaign rally — but Imran Khan was allowed to travel. So, the daring move by Nawaz Sharif did indeed unsettle the powers that be; those who continue to maintain a facade of a democratic set-up, yet put the very same democratically elected government in jeopardy when things don’t go their way. For Nawaz Sharif, this began when he dabbled with the idea of engaging India — something that really did not go too well with the establishment. Then, the huge faux pas of keeping “Kashmir” out of the   that left Pakistan fuming. One wonders if this was done by design or was an oversight of the Pakistani officials handling the final document. Either way, Nawaz Sharif had to make amends for trying to step into an area that has always been the holy space of the Pakistani military, Pakistan’s India/Kashmir Policy. But, the Army should know that Nawaz Sharif is a product of the establishment and knows them inside out.  So, even if his popularity was waning because of all the corruption cases against him and the indictment, him returning to face the laws of the land, rather than live in exile like his bête noire, General Parvez Musharraf, has made him a hero overnight. Many thought that Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s political future would come to an end even before it began — but that again is not to be. The emotional scenes of meeting her mother Kulsoom, who is extremely ill, at a hospital in London and then bidding her children goodbye stirred emotional chords back home. Her statements daring those who want the family to become irrelevant and then, her refusal of any special treatment in Adiala jail has shown she has more mettle than many would’ve imagined. The mess that has been created because of the meddling by the deep state, so they could have a favourable outcome in the upcoming elections, have come a cropper. It has also allowed the people of Pakistan to see through the divisive and often destructive ploys of the Pakistani military undermining the civilian supremacy. It would not be a surprise if PML(N) gains ground because of the brave decision by Nawaz Sharif to take on the regime and ensure a political future for the Sharif family. In this, one also has to see which of the Sharifs are to gain with this sacrifice. This could very well be brother Shehbaz Sharif’s time as the elder of the two men and his daughter stand disqualified. It is time for Shehbaz and his son Hamza to consolidate their position. Shehbaz played his cards well balancing his role in the party, his role as the Chief Minister of the Punjab and his relations with the Army. His recent statements, distancing himself from his brother’s statement, where Nawaz  the Pakistani Army of political persecution, shows the former's instinct to survive. Survive PML (N) will. Survive Nawaz and Maryam also will. But, Shehbaz and Hamza Sharif will more than survive. For the Army, a weak coalition is the best option with Imran Khan leading that coalition. But, with Imran Khan’s campaign mired with myriad controversies and refusing to ally with PPP or PML(N), and a defiant Nawaz Sharif gaining popularity yet again, the only option that the military has is to seek an understanding with Shehbaz Sharif — who could very well be the Prime Ministerial candidate for PML (N).",2018-07-16,"Bilawal Bhutto,Maryam Nawaz Sharif,Nawaz Sharif,Pakistan election",Nawaz and Maryam Sharif's arrest: A huge risk - and a political masterstroke,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pakistan-elections-nawaz-sharif-maryam-sharif-bilawal-bhutto-shehbaz-sharif-pervez-musharraf/story/1/25497.html
289,Lt Gen PR Shankar,"The recent announcement by the government to   into various ministries evoked a lot of reactions. The decision was much debated in the media, with everyone having a view over it. However, one thing came through clear — for a growing power, we need to have expertise beyond the standard IAS officers in the government. Personally, I felt it was a good decision, and welcomed it. However, it left me bemused. I felt that we were approaching it from the wrong end. I did not see any post advertised for the Ministry of Defence (MoD)! This is the ministry where niche professional knowledge and competence is the most needed. In fact, I have always considered that this is one ministry which is most the disintegrated, though it is designated as the Integrated Head Quarters of the MoD. Am I being harsh? Just consider this. Any bureaucrat in any ministry is supposed to serve and promote the interests of the personnel and organisations who are under that ministry. Right? It is only the MoD bureaucrat who has beautifully succeeded in gaining a reputation among service personnel that he is working against them — whether in equipping them, paying them or safeguarding their interests, and, as an extension, the interests of the nation.  A bureaucracy that lets its veterans sit on a protest in public and then   by police needs introspection. That too after really having done so much for grant of OROP (which was not bad, despite some drawbacks that could have been ironed out). It was an international shame. The last time veterans were publicly humiliated, in my memory, was by the USA during the Vietnam War. India let itself down. The incompetence of the MoD is contained in its own task force report on defence procurement — or the lack of it — which the honorable Dr Suresh Bhamre, MOS,  . It was a damning report. These episodes, from arcoss the spectrum of dealings in the MoD, point in just one direction. It is obvious enough to draw your own conclusions. Why is this so? That is because the MoD is manned by people who have very limited knowledge of defence affairs. The first variety is the IAS officers or other officers brought in on deputation from other ministries.  They are seeming know-it-alls and generally carry a chip of misplaced superiority on their shoulder. The second variety is the Armed Forces HQ civilian cadre, who have very little knowledge beyond Delhi but are permanently near the levers of power. They seek parity with service officers, and hence ensure that the wrong levers are always pressed. The Services HQs are satellites in orbit manned almost exclusively by service officers. All these entities work in exclusive compartments; most of the time at cross-purposes with each other. As eyewash, some service officers are posted in the MoD at insignificant positions. I have never dealt with a service officer in the MoD in any important appointment in all my assignments in Delhi. On the other hand, I always came across people dealing with important defence matters who had no clue about defence before they entered the portals of South Block. More importantly, they would have no link with defence after they completed their assignment. Many were from railways, audit, agriculture, animal husbandry, health and other myriad departments. I always wondered as to why these posts could not be manned by service officers of requisite experience. It would add so much to the system, and then Dr Bhamre would not have to be occupied with producing such cathartic reports. Elementary, my dear Watson, but Sherlock would have been stumped! You think I am exaggerating? Let me quote examples. I once led a delegation to the USA to carry out a maintenance evaluation of the 155-mm Ultra Light Howitzer (ULH). It was a multidisciplinary team consisting of representatives from Artillery (users), EME (maintainers), DGQA (quality controllers) and the MoD. A director from the MoD acquisition wing was detailed. He was a genuinely good officer with whom I had dealt with. We all landed in their artillery school in Fort Sill to evaluate the Howitzer on the mandated aspects. In our initial meeting, we introduced ourselves to the US team. We gave out our respective backgrounds. It was then that I came to know that this director was a veterinarian and from animal husbandry background. The Americans were bursting blood vessels, but kept poker faces during the discussion. I have always since wondered as to who selected a veterinary officer to handle capital procurement cases for the Army. That selecting officer was a genius in the Alfred E Neuman class. If you are wondering who Alfred E Neuman is, he was the hero of   comics of my era. Well, that director did what he could and did it extremely well, due to his other good qualities of the heart. I always admired him for that. But I have also always blamed the system for choosing a veterinary officer for that post. No wonder our procurement is poor. Anyway, that is history. It is now a part of our records that a veterinarian had a hand in assessing the maintainability of the 155-mm ULH for Indian conditions. The moral — even veterinarians can procure guns for India. Who needs Army officers? The second case pertains to the time when I was sent to the USA to do an international course on defence management. It was a fantastic course about procurement. I learnt so much there that it stood me in good stead for the rest of the decade I was in service. With the education I got there, I could make a difference to my country, and I would like to think that I did, even if my sense is misplaced about its magnitude or importance. Anyway, along with me came a director from the MoD to do this course. He was a bright and younger officer from the Indian Railways. Again, in my opinion, a very good officer. He was in an administrative post in the MoD. It was not his fault that he opted for a course in the US. There was probably no one else immediately available to do this course and he was promptly detailed. So, an officer of the Indian Railways, in an administrative job in the MoD, did a course in defence procurement management from the USA. He never procured any equipment for the Services during his deputation at the MoD. I do hope he is doing some procurement for the Railways. After all, if veterinarians can procure guns for the Army with on-the-job training, Railway men can procure engines or whatever for the Railways after learning about arms procurement in an international environment. I do hope the honorable Dr Bhamre has got some answers as to why our defence procurement is a mess. Well, coming back to the present day, I understand that these 10 posts are important and are open for service officers to apply. Great. It brings me to a question. If service officers are considered fit enough to apply for posts of joint secretaries in other ministries based on their service experience, how come they are not fit to be joint secretaries in their parent ministry where their lifetime experience will be invaluable? More so their commitment and understanding? It will contribute to greater integration of the MoD with the services, whom they are meant for. It will also promote sorely-needed joint-ness between the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. In my view, the MoD, the DRDO, the OFB and the DPSUS need to be populated with good officers from the Forces in all sections and branches. Unless charity begins at home, there is no use of big talk and reforms. Will this be done? True reform in defence affairs will come when there is integration of the MoD in earnest. Treat this question to be coming from the quintessential common man of India, who has never been answered satisfactorily. He can only look at things in bewilderment. This is the challenge I am throwing to the people in power — ministers, generals and secretaries. I am confident that this issue will be buried somewhere in the humungous files of the MoD. Will someone prove me wrong? ",2018-07-16,"Defence procurement,Lateral entry,Civil Services,Ministry of Defence",Lateral entry into civil services: Why the Ministry of Defence needs it the most,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/ministry-of-defence-lateral-entry-into-civil-services-defence-procurement-dr-suresh-bhamre/story/1/25500.html
290,Farahnaz Ispahani,"Pakistan has had a succession of weak elected civilian governments — but most of them at least started out with a veneer of respectability. The government formed after the July 25, 2018 election would be the first to lack credibility from its very first day. These elections are being held under the shadow of media censorship, arbitrary disqualifications of leading candidates, manipulation of political parties by intelligence services, and the mainstreaming of terrorists. Even by Pakistani standards, the interference of Pakistan’s military establishment is too blatant and too obvious this time for the world to ignore. If the establishment’s favorites win, they will not be viewed as having won the people's mandate.  In case they somehow lose, the stage will be set for a new round of confrontation between the establishment and its protégés, on the one hand, and the political parties they tried to block, on the other. In unprecedented panic on part of the establishment, no holds have been barred in denying space to Pakistan’s political mainstream — while mainstreaming extremists.  This is an unusual election because restrictions are in place on all moderate political parties previously preferred by voters, while extremists identified as terrorists by local and global authorities are free to participate. Elections are usually preceded by robust debate in the media — but in this instance, draconian constraints on media have been imposed by the intelligence agencies. The electronic and print media have been harassed directly by the security services and even  , the establishment newspaper since its founding by Pakistan’s founder, has not been spared. Its publisher recently described the   in Pakistan as ""censorship"".  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Women journalists are particular targets of sexually explicit comments and threats of rape. Trolls on social media call them names that are psychologically harmful. Liberals are attacked ferociously with abuse from anonymous accounts, aimed at silencing their voices. Speeches by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz — particular targets for elimination from the political scene — were taken off the air. Orders were issued to not air a live broadcast of Sharif's return to Pakistan or his subsequent arrest.   with the Sharif family were dropped or censored after being recorded. When Sharif returned to Pakistan to go to prison after being convicted on corruption charges, the caretaker government — charged with organising free and fair polls — cracked down on popular dissent in anticipation of his arrival. Hundreds of people were arrested in Lahore — many of them members of Sharif’s party, the centre-right Pakistan Muslim League (PML) — and   in parts of the city. The ensuing unrest was not confined to Lahore. Media reports indicated arrests of protesters and shutting down of major intersections in several other cities across the country. Even politicians opposed to Sharif protested this attempt to deny the right to peaceful protest. While Sharif and his daughter have been sent to prison, the deep state's mainstreaming of Pakistan's ""good terrorists"" (militant groups it treats as strategic assets against India and in Afghanistan) is well underway. Clearly, Pakistan's establishment deems allegations of financial wrongdoing a greater crime than terrorism. The corruption case against Sharif was rammed through court without regard for legal niceties and he was disqualified from holding office even before he was put on trial. Meanwhile, Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, who is accused of being involved in the Mumbai terrorist attacks of 26/11, 2008, is not only  , but also actively campaigning in these elections for the newly created political party, Tehrik Allah-o-Akbar. No questions have ever been asked about the terrorist group's financing either — an issue that has led Pakistan to be put on the grey list of the United Nations’  . Surely, if the goal is eliminating corruption, rather than re-engineering the polity, the corruption tied to terrorism also deserves some attention. Extremists have not faced a media blackout and other restrictions that applied to the PML-N and other political parties. After successful rallies by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of the assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the centrist Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was also denied permission to travel and hold rallies, alongside denial of media access. The Left-wing Awami National Party (AWP) has been the target of a terrorist attack on one of its major stars, Haroon Bilour, whose father had also been killed in a terrorist attack several years ago. That the pro-establishment Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI), led by Imran Khan, has faced neither restrictions, nor terrorist attacks indicates whose voters are being scared from coming out to the polls. Ironically, the Supreme Court Chief Justice, Saqib Nisar, who has become a significant player in Pakistan’s politics and was instrumental in Sharif’s disqualification, had withdrawn official security from Bilour, making him an easier target for terrorists. Another terrorist attack in Mastung, Balochistan — taking place on the day Nawaz Sharif and his daughter returned to Pakistan  killed 129 people, including a provincial Assembly candidate. The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) noted that “Despite the excessive presence of security forces in Balochistan, the capacity of militants to strike on this scale appears to be intact,” implicitly worrying that the terrorist attacks might be used as justification to put off elections. The HRCP rightly asserted that ""Election gatherings must not become killing fields."" But then, many Pakistanis already suspect that the July 25 election is not meant to be an exercise in democracy — it is just a cover for continued imposition of a permanent establishment's choices on the people of Pakistan.",2018-07-16,"PML-N,Nawaz Sharif,Imran Khan,Pakistan general elections",Farce Majeure: Why Pakistan’s 2018 General Election is a brutal mockery,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/why-pakistan-2018-general-election-is-nothing-but-a-farce-a-brutal-mockery-pmln-imran-khan-nawaz-sharif/story/1/25498.html
291,Arindam De,"Battling a brewing revolt in her party, Mehbooba Mufti has issued a warning — if the BJP tried to split PDP, it could result in a  . ""I think just like a Salahuddin and a Yasin Malik were born in 1987...if it (BJP) tries to break PDP like that then outcomes will be dangerous,"" Mehbooba has said.  So what happened in 1987, and how justified is Mehbooba's comparison? What role did her father, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, had in the events of the '80s?  The 1987 Jammu and Kashmir polls are widely believed to have been rigged, spreading deep discontent, and distrust for the Centre, among the Kashmiri youth, who had participated in the electoral process enthusiastically and in large numbers. That election is believed to be one of the reasons for setting off militancy in the Valley.   The seeds of 1987 were partially sown on July 2, 1984. That day, Ghulam Mohammad Shah (Gul Shah), brother-in-law of Farooq Abdullah, defected from the National Conference (NC) along with 12 MLAs, bringing down the government. Then he allied with the Congress, which had a strength of 26 MLAs, and became chief minister. Who was responsible? How? Why? Like most things in Kashmir, there are multiple versions of the ""truth"". Some say Indira Gandhi lost faith in Farooq Abdullah, or maybe Abdullah's victory over Congress in 1983 still rankled, or the CM was not too active in countering alleged Sikh extremist camps operating in the Valley. We shall never know. What we do know is that although Abdullah knew of the rumblings in his party, he was reportedly assuaged by the fact that old friend and colleague Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, while distributing the wedding cards of his younger daughter, had publicly said that he wanted no political upheaval at least for the seven days the wedding celebrations would go on — the wedding date was July 5, 1984. Ghulam Mohammad Shah split the NC and formed a new party, Awami National Conference. While the 1983 polls had seen a rout for the Islamists, they started to gain some foothold under Gul Shah. Then the locks of the Babri Masjid, in faraway Ayodhya, were opened on February 1, 1986. Gul Shah stirred up passions with his comments of February 1986 that ""  (Islam is in danger)."" Most parts of Kashmir were peaceful, but violence started in restive south Kashmir. Hindus were targeted, although there were no loss of lives. The governor dismissed Gul Shah's government on March 12, 1986, but the damage had been done — a political situation was portrayed in the light of religion — a ""Hindu"" central government imposing its will on ""Muslim"" Kashmir. The divide was complete. Some sources suggest that Mufti sahab did little to try and contain violence in his area. It is said that he harboured chief ministerial ambitions, but that did not fructify. It was probably Rajiv Gandhi's friendship with Farooq Abdullah that stopped the senior most Congress leader's chief ministerial aspirations in its track. Instead, Mufti sahab was shifted to the Centre. Farooq Abdullah had an absolute majority, but chose to embrace the Congress. While he professed the development of Kashmir as the reason, others see revenge on his mind — to sideline the MLAs who defected, and the betrayed of the tacit assurance that accompanied the wedding card. Mufti sahab was disappointed, to say the least. Some critics allege that before the 1987 polls, he had campaigned surreptitiously for the Muslim United Front, but there is nothing anecdotal to suggest any such action. Actually, the MUF was an indigenous, spontaneous political group.  Unlike other political parties, it was not ""imported"". Elections were held on March 23, 1987. But the enthusiastic response spooked the government, ensuring that through rigging, they took away the mandate from the people, probably afraid of a new, local political force that would usher in the end of controlling Kashmir through remote control. Even the senior Abdullah would recount later, “I am not saying the elections weren’t rigged,” he said. “But I didn’t rig them.” The rest is common knowledge. Top MUF leaders were arrested... sometimes on charges of anti-national activities. The neighbouring country only took advantage of the situation and fanned the flames. MUF leader Muhammad Yusuf Shah assumed the name of Syed Salahuddin and started heading the Hizbul Mujahideen. His election manager, Yasin Malik went on to head another terror-secessionist front (JKLF), which, incidentally, some   kidnapped Mufti sahab's daughter Rubaiyya. Mufti sahab, then the Union home minister in the VP Singh-led government, acceded to the terrorist's demands and released some of their imprisoned accomplices. This single event led boosted the morale of the separatists and the terrorists like nothing else — they really believed that Kashmir's azadi was just around the corner. Then the Valley changed forever. Ethnic cleansing was complete and central security forces had little control over city centres. Today, if someone is to infer that actions of 1987 led to the incubation of militancy in Kashmir, they would be dragged over embers by secularists. The very same ones who were behind what happened during the 1987 elections. Cut to 2018. The ruling dispensation, the BJP, says it displayed courage and political sagacity to tie up with a political outfit whose ideology of soft separatism is diametrically opposite to its own. The decision probably came out of the realisation that Kashmir needed to be treated humanely, probably it was plain political compulsion. Either way, it was a daring experiment. Political success was exchanged for a revamped image. Daring political experiments, radical ways of thinking are often defeated, sacrificed at the altar of realpolitik. But to equate that, as Mehbooba is doing, with a most unfair and undemocratic action of overturning the people's will, and that too when facing little immediate political defeat, would be unfair.",2018-07-14,"Terrorism,Farooq Abdullah,NC,Kashmir",Mehbooba predicts post 1987 redux in the Valley - Really?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mehbooba-mufti-pdp-bjp-kashmir-nc-farooq-abdullah-terrorism/story/1/25460.html
292,Saif Ullah Khan,"Former Vice-President Hamid Ansari on July 12 triggered a row by backing the proposal of opening Sharia courts in the country, saying that each community has the right to practise its own personal law. ""People are confusing social practices with legal system. Our law recognises that each community can have its own rules. Personal law in India covers marriage, divorce, adoption and inheritance. Each community has a right to practise its own personal law,"" he told news agency ANI. Last week, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) announced its plan to set up Sharia courts across the country to resolves issues as per Islamic laws. The matter will be discussed on July 15 at a meeting in the national capital. ""At present, there are 40 such courts in Uttar Pradesh. We plan to open one such court in all districts of the country. The objective of Darul-Qaza is to resolve matters in light of Shariat laws instead of going to other courts,"" AIMPLB senior member Zafaryab Zilani had said. Not one to be left behind, Uttar Pradesh Shia Central Waqf Board chief Waseem Rizvi, who had previously   a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to shut down madrasas as ""religious education institutions bred terrorists"", slammed the proposal. Rizvi questioned the AIMPLB's authority to set up such courts, saying there was no place for such legal recourse in the country. ""There is a Constitution in India; judges are appointed on the basis of that. There is no place for Shariat courts in India. Who is Muslim Personal Law Board to set up parallel courts? This is sedition,"" Rizvi had said. Another, more significant body to take offence to Ansari's remarks was the ruling BJP. While the AIMPLB did clarify that the courts would merely interpret sharia, or the Islamic law, for Muslims who approach them for arbitration, the BJP was not satisfied. Ansari was merely voicing his opinion, but the reaction of the BJP — whose Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar had earlier   Khap Panchayats in his state, calling them ""useful instruments"" of society that carry out social reforms — was nothing but political. The BJP attacked the former VP, with party MP and spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi   there was ""no place for a Shariat court, be it (in a) district or village or city"". She added that this was not the ""Islamic Republic of India"". Lekhi, a senior lawyer, chose to gloss over the fact that the top court itself had earlier rejected the plea for a ban on Sharia courts. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, himself a member of the personal law board, was quick to ask the BJP leaders to read the Supreme Court's judgement on Sharia courts before commenting. ""These are Darul Qaza and they resolve disputes speedily at very little expense,"" the Hyderabad MP said. The former VP has been in the crosshairs of the Modi government ever since he said that   in India, in reply to a question by Karan Thapar on Rajya Sabha TV. Stung by the remarks, the PM himself had led the charge against Ansari. Speaking during Ansari's farewell, Modi recalled his diplomatic career, during which he spent many years in West Asia, and his role, after retirement, as the vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University and as the chairman of the Minorities Commission. But by apparently reducing the former VP to just his Muslim identity, the PM glossed over his illustrious career and tried his best to dismiss Ansari's remarks over the insecurity among minorities as coming from a person selfishly vested only in his own community. The Supreme Court on July 7, 2014, refused to ban Sharia courts, but said they have no legal sanction and a fatwa or diktat pronounced by them is not binding on anyone. ""No religion is allowed to curb anyone's fundamental rights,"" the SC said to a petition by a Delhi-based advocate, Vishwa Lochan Madan, who challenged parallel religious courts run by institutions like the Darul Qaza and Darul Iftaa. The court ruled that fatwas — basically, opinions of experts in Muslim personal law — may be issued only if parties approach them for dispute resolution or adjudication, mainly in civil and matrimonial issues. In any event, the fatwa is not binding on anyone, including the person who asked for it, said a bench of Justices Chandramauli K Prasad and P C Ghose. These courts offer an informal justice delivery system for amicable settlements, the court ruled. The petitioner had argued that Sharia courts decided on religious and social freedoms of Muslim citizens and restricted their fundamental rights with their fatwas. The court reserved its verdict in February, saying, ""These are political-religious issues. We can't decide them. In this country some people believe Gangajal can cure all ailments. It is a matter of belief."" The community seems divided on the issue of Sharia courts. Several Muslim scholars have held that the SC's 2014 ruling does not contradict Islamic principles. They opine that the Shariat pertains to social laws that are subject to conditions in society — Muslims can follow the Shariat as much as is possible in their society. According to a report in  , several experts said that Muslims in India anyway subject themselves to the country's secular criminal laws — only private family matters may be settled through fatwas or Islamic edicts, ""when both sides have agreed"" to abide by such diktats. Others are skeptical and believe opening such courts will only draw negative attention towards the community, especially in today's communally charged atmosphere.Some Muslim women have also long protested the Sharia Courts, saying that being male-dominated, their decisions are lopsided. They say since the rulings cannot be enforced, the men refuse to abide by them if the decisions don't go in their favour. While it's true that the rule of law is supreme in any society, the presence of Sharia Courts do serve a useful purpose in resolving trivial disputes. Most complainants who approach these courts don't have the resources to approach a regular court. Unlike the formal legal system, these processes are speedy and inexpensive. Once the ruling is delivered, it is up to the complainants to abide with it or not. Since the Qazi has no power to enforce the verdict, it cannot be termed as either in conflict with, or parallel to the Indian judicial system. While Ansari may have been legally right in his views on Sharia courts, the ruling BJP, bestowed with the responsibility of enforcing the law, both in letter and spirit, chose to willfully politicise the issue by making it 'us versus them'. Instead of allaying fears and dispelling rumours, the party chose to use it as yet another ploy to rally its right-wing support base. By calling it a step towards a supposed ""Islamic Republic of India', the ruling BJP is trying to feed into the narrative that Muslims are still not an integral part of this country and their loyalties apparently lie across the border. While this may play well with the ruling party vote bank, it will further deepen communal fault lines. With the minority community already reeling under the recent spate of lynchings, with everything from their food choices to their attire coming under attack, the BJP's reaction to the former VP's comments is yet another reminder of the extent to which our political parties will go to please their vote bank .",2018-07-13,"Narendra Modi,Muslims,Sharia court,Hamid Ansari","The BJP doesn't mind khap panchayats, but is politicising Hamid Ansari's Sharia court remarks",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/hamid-ansari-sharia-courts-aimplb-muslims-bjp-narendra-modi-triple-talaq/story/1/25455.html
293,Archana Dalmia,"July is a rainbow month. It not just makes us recall the Delhi HC judgment of July 2, 2009, decriminalising the LGBTIQA (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Inter-sex, Queer and Asexual) community, but also the month is now witnessing the case being heard in the Supreme Court. Yes, justice is slow, but as the bench of legislatures indicates, it is sure. While it is heartening that the Supreme Court has decided to take a stand on the issue that has been in limbo, it pains to hear the kind of arguments that are being made against the abolishment of Section 377 of the IPC, enacted in 1860. For those not in the know, Section 377, enforced by Lord Macaulay of the British Raj, criminalises sex between consenting adults of the same sex or those whose gender is non-normative. There were comments like those by Manoj George of the Apostolic Alliance of Churches, “The majority of India does not want to decriminalise 377.” Then, of course, one heard the oft-repeated saying, “It is against the law of nature”, to which Justice Indu Malhotra (the lone woman judge on the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court hearing the fight against Section 377 of the IPC) pointed out, “There are hundreds of species in the animal world which indulge in same sex intercourse.” But the one which took the bakery was the comment that compared what two adults do in the privacy of their bedroom to bestiality! The difference between bestiality and consensual sex needs to be spelt out: while humans can give consent, animals cannot and that in itself rules out any association between the two acts. Anyway, cases of inter-species copulation (and surprisingly there are many incidents of men trying to have sex with animals) need a separate law to address the issue as does child molestation that is non-penetrative. The colonisers clubbed all these together under Section 377 and we have not bothered to change it, even though the UK has gone many steps ahead and made gay marriage legal. The British PM hailed it as a step that will make all people equal, whether ""gay or straight."" In a democracy, everyone has a right to equal opportunity and respectable life. That is the vision of an equitable society that forms government through ballot. Unfortunately, the current vision of this community is coloured by prejudice. From suicides in Chennai to a doctor being extorted by young boys posing as same sex lovers in Bengaluru, to an effeminate boy being flogged in Delhi, intolerance towards the LGBTIQA community often takes a violent hue. Also, I have often wondered why ""hijras"" are so pushy and loud — whether while begging or dancing and singing at celebrations. Their loudness masks their vulnerability — they are forced to be aggressive to counter the lewd jokes, prejudices and violence unleashed on them. Unfortunately, majoritarian politics have labelled the LGBTIQA community minuscule and continue to ignore its rights and liberties. Regressive statements abound from politicians and gurus. Only a few young leaders are willing to address the grievances of the LGBT community. The RSS’s stand on the matter is well known. Its leaders have gone on to defend the law which criminalises LGBTIQA people. In this scenario, however, there is a ray of light when BJP leader and former RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav says that criminalisation of gays is debatable. This shows that even the most rigid elements need to take cognisance of direction in which the world is moving. In Australia, Norrie, an androgynous person, won the right to be recognised as neither ""male"" nor ""female."" A couple of weeks later, the Supreme Court recognised transgenders as a constitutional category. This will change the forms that have categories only for male and female.The world is getting sensitive to minority rights, however small the minority may be. And this is what it is to be human — to respect each other, not discriminate on the basis of gender, orientation, or any divisive ideology. Today youngsters at parties may be open about being gay or lesbian, but sniggering and whispering still happen. Truth be told, I feel a little uncomfortable at public display, owing to my prejudices, but I understand that one must respect everyone’s right to freedom of expression. I believe that if any relationship between two adults is consensual, it should be nobody’s business. It is heartening to see people from the LGBTIQA community still protesting for their rights. So is to witness art exhibitions like ME We at the American Center in Delhi and the S&S Trunk Show at the Lalit #TAKEPRIDE. After all, we do not want to join ranks with Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia in this matter, do we?

294,Fahad Shah,"On  , prominent civil services officer from the Kashmir Valley, Shah Faesal, tweeted, in response to the rising number of rapes.  He called his tweet sarcastic – but for that tweet, the central government has reportedly decided to take action against him, saying that he “acted in a manner unbecoming of a public servant.” Importantly, Faesal has been an avid user of social media – both Facebook and Twitter, often sparking controversies for which he receives backlash from people who either don’t agree with his viewpoint or don’t understand it at all. But there is something about Shah Faesal – more than being any civil services officer, he was, very famously, the   (IAS) exam, and has been celebrated by mainstream political parties and media, projected as “a role model” for Kashmiri youth. In a region that has been engulfed in violence for over three decades, and where the toll of civilian killings by government forces has continuously mounted, Faesal stands in the middle of the classic Shakespearean “To be, or not to be?” dilemma.  a civil servant under a regime that was earlier celebrating him as a hero, though now only if he follows their diktats –   but rather be an individual who has his own take on issues like politics, conflicts, even rapes in the country. As  , last year, over five rape cases per day were reported in India. This number does not even scratch the surface though, as we all know, of sexual violence in the country. Yet, the government has initiated a departmental inquiry against Faesal for his “sarcastic tweet against rape-culture in South Asia”, following a request from the Centre’s Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT). “You have allegedly failed to maintain absolute honesty and integrity in the discharge of official duty and thus acted in a manner unbecoming of a public servant,” read the notice issued by the General Administration Department (GAD). Calling the order a “ ” from his boss, while sharing the copy of this online, Faesal tweeted that the irony here is that “service rules with a colonial spirit are invoked in a democratic India to stifle the freedom of conscience. I'm sharing this to underscore the need for a rule change.” In the last eight years since he came into the limelight for topping one of India’s apex exams, Faesal has often been at odds with the government. On his social media, he has made sarcastic remarks on the government and also on the political situation in the Valley. In March last year, he called a government job “slavery of mind, eyes, tongue, hands and feet.” Another such point was made when news channels and politicians projected him as the Kashmiri youth’s role model standing opposite the popular militant commander Burhan Wani, who was killed on July 8, 2016. A week later, Faesal threatened to resign if the “nonsense” continued, saying, “By juxtaposing my photos with the images of a slain militant commander, a section of national media has once again fallen back upon its conventional savagery that cashes on falsehoods, divides people and creates more hatred.” For him, though, Faesal believes in being a civil servant and getting paid for his work. “Beyond that, I am not in any kind of relationship with my employer,” he tells me over a chat we have after the inquiry order is passed. “It is not my fault if someone declares me a role model in June – and in July, a cautionary tale. My individuality is intact and I see myself as more than an IAS officer which is a person who has a life beyond the official chores.” Coming from a region that the BJP-led central government wants to control through perceptions and military tactics, Faesal has two choices – either a job with applied conditions of following the norms of the said government, or living as an individual. But the love-hate relationship, as confusing as it can get, may not work for a Kashmiri. You can’t be a Kashmiri and speak freely against the government – you are immediately one among hundreds of thousands of dissenters who raise valid points about their rights and their dignity of life.   In May 2016, when another Kashmiri, Athar Aamir-ul-Shafi Khan, 23, secured the second rank in the same exam, then chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said, “They look up to you and Shah Faesal as role models as you have practically demonstrated how thirst for excellence can be quenched by hard work, perseverance and belief in one’s ability.” However, Faesal tells me that ideologically, he is attracted to the middle ground and that often makes it difficult for him to play to either of the galleries. “I get trolled from both sides but that only helps me stay afloat in the middle. I’m not complaining.” Interestingly, Omar Abdullah, Vice-President of the National Conference, who was also chief minister when Faesal had topped the exam, came to his defense after the ""Rapistan"" controversy was sparked. Abdullah tweeted that it “looks like the DOPT is determined to chase @shahfaesal out of the civil services.” Falling in-between the two sides – where he is either a Kashmiri who can think for himself or a government servant with diktats to follow, Faesal agrees that the existential dilemmas never end. “As long as we are faced with the difficult choice of choosing between truth and power, the dilemma will remain. My belief is that the traditional understanding of what civil servants can say and what they can't needs to be debated. Times are changing. Society also has to change,” he adds. But the debate over his remarks and the following inquiry only shows that the Centre doesn’t agree with you if you don’t follow their line – you can’t think, as thinking may lead you to question something that is seriously wrong in the power corridors – like I just did. ",2018-07-12,"Jammu,Omar Abdullah,IAS,Srinagar","To tweet, or not to tweet – The dilemma of being Shah Faesal",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/shah-faesal-kashmir-srinagar-ias-omar-abdullah-jammu/story/1/25428.html
295,Abhijit Iyer-Mitra,"Today marks the Nth feint of the LGBT community in its attempt to . Despite some stellar work and dogged persistence, the moment begs the question — why has the community’s fight for decriminalisation taken so long in a society that can arguably be classified as one of the most open to same-sex relations, historically and in modern times, socially least violently opposed to it in the Third World? The answers are tough and should force the community to introspect. The replies relate mostly to tactical clumsiness, placing hope in quixotic feints that never stood any chance of success and allowing itself to be hijacked by a “community leadership” that is heavily political, lives in grandstanding, seeking 15 seconds of TV fame, conflating publicity with achievement. One should not overlay all of these issues on just one set of people, each of these described being different clusters — but clusters that come together in one toxic whole that have considerably set back community efforts. To understand this, we have to separate two linked but related issues — the anthropological and the legal. To understand what is wrong with the approach, we need to first understand the anthropological patterns of how the acceptance of homosexuality works in modern states. Inevitably since the 1700s, this has followed a sequence — first, normalisation, then decriminalisation, then guarantee of equal rights and finally, special protection/affirmative action. The first country to do so was France, following the French Revolution in 1790. Yet, Britain — which was arguably industrialising faster — did not decriminalise homosexuality till 1967, almost 200 years later with the last execution awarded in a case of homosexuality in 1836. Russia, in fact, did not criminalise homosexuality till 1832, with decriminalisation happening only in 1917 following the Russian Revolution. In these cases, there are two distinct strands. Where decriminalisation happened peacefully, it happened late — and where it was enacted before society was ready for it, it happened in a fit of violent revolutionary fervour. In India, thankfully, despite the fact that we are not an industrialised state, society has never seen violent homophobia. Moreover, normalisation has never been an uphill challenge and opposition to decriminalisation has never turned violent. Clearly then, the social conditions for decriminalisation are ripe. The problem, however, comes about by the overt political twist of the Gay Rights movement, largely owing to the malaise of intersectionality. What this means is that gay rights gets clubbed together with a whole bunch of issues where society is much more polarised — these issues include how to deal with Naxals, terrorists in Kashmir and their B-team, the stone pelters, as well as the urban “tukde tukde” gang. Herein lies the first big tactical blunder of the gay rights movement — in search of mythical allies in the fight against a mythical enemy, they have instigated opposition across the board by making common cause with the same people that approve of throwing gay people off roofs or hanging them from cranes, against a dispensation that, while not sympathetic to them, is horrified at the thought of violence carried out against the community. Moreover, the conflation of everything, from normalisation to special protections, which, in anthropological terms, took the West 250 years, is sought to be compressed into a timeline of 10-15 years. While nobody can deny the demand is just, there are tactical issues that must be considered here. This masochistic path of generating “maximum resistance” has been taken to legal extremes as well — and has resulted in the loss of much goodwill, not to mention time, treasure and effort. All one needs to do to decriminalise homosexuality is to simply get a Supreme Court directive saying: “consensual sex does not come under the purvey of 377”. Yet (and I would like to stress some of the smarter lawyers on the LGBT side have avoided this trap) a large portion of the argument rests on getting rid of IPC 377 altogether, something no court can legally do — overturn a code enacted by legislation. Indeed in keeping with the 1st Amendment to the Constitution and practiced in jurisprudence, when security has collided with human rights, courts have more often than not chosen security over the individual. This was compounded by a well-intentioned but entirely futile effort by Dr Shashi Tharoor   legalising same-sex relations, when, in fact, there was no need for such an immense squandering of effort, for a goal that could have been achieved for a far lesser price. Rights are per se a legal fiction, as is the law. Pitting fiction against fiction is never a good idea, and from day one, the focus should not have been human rights which, though great for 15 seconds of fame, really bear no legal traction. Instead, the focus from day one should have been what the current team has finally settled for: a reading down of 377 on the basis of science as no single scientific body is willing to say that same-sex relations are unnatural anymore. Moreover, given that a particularly destructive feminist lobby ensured that the post-Nirbhaya case rape laws were made female-specific, 377 provides the gay male with the only legal recourse against rape in addition to the laws related to assault. All of this is water under the bridge and nothing can be done about this now. The point is, irrespective of where the judgement of the Supreme Court goes, the LGBT movement needs to do some serious introspection on its severe missteps — chronic politicisation, publicity-seeking and tactical blunders which, to quote that great Frenchman Talleyrand, “are worse than crimes”. In short, a mountain has been made of a molehill and we await results that could have been achieved a lot quicker, with a lot less effort.What should however be acknowledged is that whatever has been achieved has not been achieved in some heroic fight against the state — but with much tacit approval and help of a fundamentally benign state, whether one chooses to admit that or not.",2018-07-12,"Lgbtq+,Supreme Court,Homosexuality,Section 377","Fighting 377, stupidly: In seeking 15 seconds of fame, gay rights activists have only lost valuable time",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/fighting-377-stupidly-in-seeking-15-seconds-of-fame-gay-rights-activists-have-only-lost-valuable-time/story/1/25427.html
296,Arindam De,"Union minister Jayant Sinha on Wednesday, July 11,   over the recent garlanding of eight people, convicted for lynching a man to death. But the apology makes little sense now given that Sinha first went ahead to felicitate convicted criminals and then justified it saying the matter was sub judice. The uproar that followed Sinha's felicitating the eight men was thus justified and so was the Opposition's criticism of it. The junior aviation minister's sorry follows a petition against him which has sought withdrawal of his Harvard alumni status. The petition was subsequently   by Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Given the reach and impact of social media, it is only natural for such acts to become the talking point within no time. A public figure, least of all a government minister, has no business trying to capitalise on such a sensitive issue that concerns life and death. What the minister could have done to avoid the embarrassment is to not have met the eight men in the first place or apologised as soon as the incident became public. But the worst thing that the current dispensation seems to be doing is trying to defend acts of violence in the name of cow protection and then going on to apologise once the criticism over it grows. Such repeated owning and disowning of lynch mobs can cause an irreparable damage to the party when it comes to the perception battle. And the perception gaining ground is that there is no such thing as the fringe anymore because the so-called fringe has come to be the mainstream. This is going to seriously harm the prospects of the ruling dispensation in the 2019 general elections. Therefore, these issues must be addressed. The Bharatiya Janata Party must wake up now and devise a strategy to fight this perception battle. And Jayant Sinha must understand that he can't silence criticism by issuing an apology. He must make his stand on the issue clear.",2018-07-12,"BJP,Rahul Gandhi,Harvard university,Garlanding lynch mobs",Why Jayant Sinha's apology over garlanding members of lynch mob means nothing,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/jayant-sinha-garlanding-lynch-mobs-harvard-university-rahul-gandhi-bjp/story/1/25426.html
297,Minhaz Merchant,"The quiet, green village of  home for over two years. His fortified mansion hires locals and provides an economic fillip to this Hertfordshire county that is prosperous, but like the rest of Britain looking anxiously at an uncertain post-Brexit future. Mallya’s presence is not entirely unwelcome. His  has many local followers. The protracted battle waged by the Indian government to bring Mallya to justice took one small step forward with the British High Court allowing 13 Indian banks to enter several of his British properties (including his Tewin mansion) and, following approval from the appropriate authority, seize the goods and other material in them. Does the order bring Mallya any closer to being extradited? The short answer: no. First, Mallya has appealed against the court order. Till the appeal is heard, it’s status quo. If Mallya loses his appeal, he can move Britain’s Supreme Court and after that the final arbiter, the House of Lords. British justice is relatively swift, but it does not move at the speed India would like it to — potentially depriving the Narendra Modi government of a key victory over an economic offender by bringing him back to India before the 2019 Lok Sabha election. More promising for the Modi government is the order passed by  court under the new fugitive ordinance. The court has ordered Mallya to be present in the court on August 27. If he doesn’t comply, his assets in India will be seized without further notice. This is the order that worries Mallya, not the British court’s seizure judgment. His Indian assets are far more valuable than his British assets most of which (including the Tewin mansion) are anyway not on his name. What the PMLA court judgment does is give Mallya the option to appear before it on August 27, and voluntarily allow the sale of his Indian assets. If Mallya fails to appear before the court, those assets (amounting to over Rs 12,500 crore) will be sold under the supervision of the court. Mallya knows this. It is no coincidence that he filed an application before the Karnataka High Court on June 22, 2018, to pledge the sale of his “available assets” totalling Rs 13,300 crore. What Mallya wants is to avoid returning to India and being arrested. He has accepted that he will have to pay the banks what he owes then — a principal amount of over Rs 6,200 core which, with several years’ accumulated interest, totals just under Rs 10,000 crore. In addition, he will have to pay (again with accumulated interest) employees’ salaries, TDS and service tax dues, airport rentals, vendors’ outstandings and myriad other debts associated with Kingfisher Airlines. Defenders of Mallya say he has been singled out for harsh treatment. Under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), banks have given other defaulting promoters debt haircuts ranging from 10 per cent to 83 per cent. Mallya has been given no concessions. The reason for this is obvious: Mallya fled India; other defaulting promoters submitted themselves to the IBC process. Despite being given several opportunities to return to India and negotiate a settlement with banks, Mallya refused  to do so. Instead he offered two years ago to pay just over Rs 4,000 crore, refused to return to India to face criminal cases filed against him and confined himself to writing open letters to the prime minister and finance minister. In Britain, meanwhile, Mallya leads an extravagant, even ostentatious lifestyle. In India, his unpaid employees remained unpaid. One family member of a former Kingfisher employee, facing a severe financial crisis, committed suicide. How will the Mallya story end? And what impact will its outcome have on the status of other economic offenders like Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Jatin Mehta? Mallya will resist returning to India. He will allow his assets to be seized. Those pledged by him as collateral personal guarantees to banks have already have been attached. They will now be sold under court supervision. Banks and other creditors, including employees, will receive their dues with interest. But Mallya may not return to India — yet. Once the recovery process is over though, he will attempt to extinguish his fugitive tag. That could pave the way for his return to India. He may, however, still face criminal charges pending against him for being a wilful defaulter. Tewin might host him for a while longer. Mallya’s key assets that will be used to pay bankers and other creditors are his liquid shares in United Spirits Ltd and United Breweries Holdings Ltd. Both companies are now run by multinationals Diageo and Heineken respectively. Their market value has more than doubled since they took over management control form Mallya. Ironically, Mallya’s ability to pay off his creditors is due to the rise in the market value of his two flagship companies where he has ceded control. Does that make Mallya a pauper? Not by a long shot. His non-pledged assets in India are still substantial. His overseas assets include breweries and the Force India Formula 1 team. At the end of the protracted battle, Mallya will still be a billionaire with a net worth of around $ 1 billion (Rs 6,900 crore) even after paying off his entire debt of around Rs 13,000 crore. More importantly, how will the resolution of the Mallya case affect the ongoing prosecution of Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and others? The red corner notice issued by Interpol will restrict Nirav’s movement, but extradition may be far trickier. Even in Mallya’s case, extradition — despite concerted efforts by the Indian government through the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) – is unlikely to succeed. The laxity shown by Indian investigation agencies that allowed fugitives like Mallya, Nirav Modi and Choksi to flee India is a systemic flaw. Rich offenders get away. The poor often stay in prison as undertrials for longer than even the maximum sentence they would have received had they been convicted. The Modi government needs to show results in its fight against corruption with a high-value captive like Vijay Mallya, or a Nirav Modi.

298,Lokpria Vasudevan,"The Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP pulled out all stops to ensure a grand success of its party president Amit Shah’s visit to Chennai. Alas, it only turned out to be a huge embarrassment for the party, as Shah landed in Chennai amidst the chants of  . With over 1,20,000 tweets the BJP top brass had to face the ire of a state that has been indifferent to the overtures of the saffron party.  The #gobackamitshah highlights the inherent problems BJP face in a bipolar state like Tamil Nadu. The state witnessed a political churn following demise of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. DMK chief Karunanidhi has been inactive as well. But the BJP has been unable to tap the political vacuum in the past one and a half years.  In spite of a conducive environment, the BJP finds it hard to shed its image of an “outsider”. Starting from the Jallikattu protests, opposition for the Neutrino observatory in Theni to the agitations against NEET and delay in setting up of the Cauvery Water Management Board, the series of anti-BJP protests only witnessed the anger rising against the party. For Amit Shah, the man with the Midas touch, Tamil Nadu remains one of the biggest challenges. The BJP candidate in the recent RK Nagar bypolls, held in December 2017, lost to NOTA. So poor was the national party’s performance that it failed to leave a mark in what was touted to be an important election. It’s in this context that Shah’s visit is considered very crucial to boost the morale of party cadres and also to sow the seeds of alliance formation for 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Invoking Tamil pride, Amit Shah   insisted that no other party was as committed to preserving it as the BJP. With just a lone MP, BJP is trying to manoeuvre through the complex caste dynamics in the Dravidian heartland. The state-level conference of the SC/ST wing of the party in May was seen as an attempt to shed its upper caste party tag. The party has now trained its guns on the dominant Vanniyar community in northern Tamil Nadu. Enjoying a strong support among the Nadar community, the party is also eyeing the politically significant Thevar community votes in southern Tamil Nadu. In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Jayalalithaa rode to success thundering. Tamil Nadu’s lady was better than Gujarat’s Modi in providing better administration in all spheres of the governance. The AIADMK had won 37 out of the 39 Lok Sabha seats. Cut to present: The AIADMK is in chaos and struggling to keep the flock together. Rebel leader TTV Dhinakaran’s success in RK Nagar bypolls made him a darling of masses. In a state where politics propel star power, superstars Rajinikanth and ""Ulaganayagan"" Kamal Haasan have chosen the perfect time to take political plunge. While Rajinikanth vows by spiritual politics making him a natural ally of the BJP, a recent meeting between Kamal Haasan and Congress president Rahul Gandhi has given credence to the speculations of an alternative alliance. Political observers don’t rule out a rainbow alliance that would consist of the Congress, Kamal’s party, the two left parties and TTV Dhinakaran. The two national parties, Congress and BJP, which have always piggybacked on any of the Dravidian majors, will again have to look for an ally in the Dravidian parties. The DMK, which is the principal opposition in the state, is trying to bring the Congress and the other political parties under one umbrella in the state to oppose the ruling AIADMK and the BJP in the Centre.   Parties like Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam(MDMK), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) are likely to be part of a DMK-led alliance, led by MK Stalin. Nursing chief ministerial ambitions, PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss is likely to test its might once again by going it alone like in the Assembly polls, 2016.

299,Kanwal Sibal,"India’s foreign policy is obliged to navigate skillfully through the prevailing currents in international relations, even as its larger goals of defending sovereignty, safeguarding territorial integrity, building a peaceful and secure environment, creating supportive constituencies abroad and using external relations to increase prosperity at home remain constant. While judging the successes and failures of our foreign policy, a realistic view should be taken of the multiple challenges we face and our capacity to deal with them within the complex web of competing interests, unequal power equations, international law and so on. Our foreign policy is not based on the assumption that we have the power to advance our interests as we wish. Or that if we played well our cards we can largely accomplish what we want. Even stronger powers than India cannot always have their way and have to accept setbacks or compromises. International law, the interests of others, the nature and strength of adversaries, the cost of using force, longer-term consequences of actions taken — all condition the conduct of foreign policy. The frequent criticism that we have mismanaged our neighbourhood overlooks Pakistan’s and China’s role in distorting relations between India and its neighbours, the vulnerability our smaller neighbours feel because of our size, their fear of loss of sovereignty and identity, the historically rooted divisive religious and ethnic issues in the region and so on. Admirers of Chanakya should understand that our neighbours court China in order to balance India’s weight and extract more concessions from us. Within India, too many argue that as a big country we should be more generous towards our smaller neighbours. In reality, we are far more generous towards our neighbours than China is with them or its own neighbours. Nepal profits greatly from the open border with India, the transit facilities it receives should be compared to the limited ones that Bangladesh provides us or Pakistan’s refusal to provide any. Which country (China?) will be as tolerant towards millions of illegal migrants from Bangladesh as we are. Our attitude towards water sharing with Bangladesh and Pakistan should be compared to China’s conduct as an upper riparian. We have shown a commitment to Sri Lanka’s territorial integrity in the most difficult and sensitive context of the Tamil issue. The Maldives is reliant on us in many ways, but we are tolerating its current offensive policies towards India. Compared to America, Russia, China or Israel, we have treated Pakistan’s state-sponsored terrorism against us with remarkable indulgence. Unfortunately, barring Bhutan, the reality of our generosity does not get adequately reflected in the policies of our neighbours towards us. Our neighbourhood problems are getting aggravated because of China’s investment in highly ambitious land and maritime connectivity projects in our region that are part of its grand design to dominate Asia and progressively shape global governance as an equal of the United States. India has to cope with this reality with fewer resources at its disposal, a different political system and an international outlook that is less power-driven. Our supposed over-investment in the US and Donald Trump has drawn criticism following the second postponement of the 2+2 India-US dialogue, but this rebuff should be seen in perspective. We are not the only ones unsettled by Trump’s mercurial personality and diplomacy. President Emmanuel Macron’s confidence that because of the special rapport he had established with Trump he could prod him not to repudiate the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the Iranian nuclear deal has been rudely shaken. Many believe that he was humiliated during his last visit to Washington. Trump has cold-shouldered Angela Merkel and hit out at Germany and the EU for unfair trade practices. He has imposed higher tariffs on European steel and aluminum and is threatening to hit European automobiles if the EU retaliates. He has started a trade war with China despite China’s efforts to ward it off. Russia has seen its diplomats expelled and sanctions imposed on its principal energy, defence and commodity companies. Yet, he will hold a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin shortly, just as he continues to praise president Xi Jinping personally. Does all this mean that the foreign policy of European powers, China and Russia has failed, or that US foreign policy has got unhinged? Bullying represents a failure of diplomacy, with long-term costs to the US of alienating allies and partners. The extraterritorial application of draconian US sanctions on Iran has deeply upset European political opinion. Europe’s strategic weakness has been exposed. US hold over the global financial system would weigh with China and Iran as well in mulling the extent of their defiance. India has been asked to end its oil imports from Iran by November and pressure is being applied to dissuade us from purchasing the S-400 air defence system from Russia in view of US sanctions on the Russian manufacturer. This would be unacceptable on several counts, that of exposing India unlawfully to US sanctions against third countries, interference in India’s vital relations with Russia, destabilising India’s sensitive relations with Iran, and compromising the independence of India’s foreign policy. India-US “strategic ties” should not mean making India subscribe to America’s global strategy against India’s own strategic interests. No country, including India, can boast of a successful foreign policy on all fronts. With that caveat, given the circumstances, our foreign policy under Modi has been agile, imaginative, pragmatic and confident.

300,Tridivesh Singh Maini,"Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has been in the saddle for 15 months now, and even his own party colleagues and legislators agree in private that his government’s performance has been far below expectations. While he was accused of inaccessibility and having a coterie in his previous stint too, his grip over the administration as well as the cabinet, and ability to take quick decisions, covered up for his shortcomings. In his current tenure, Amarinder Singh has been a pale shadow of his former self. In the past few days, a number of important decisions have been taken in the context of the war on drugs. Seeing the rise in deaths (June alone saw 25 deaths) in the state as a consequence of the drug problem, Singh on July 2 recommended capital punishment for all drug peddlers. In a tweet, the Punjab CM stated: “My govt has decided to recommend death penalty for drug peddling/smuggling. The recommendation is being forwarded to the Union government. Since drug peddling is destroying entire generations, it deserves exemplary punishment. I stand by my commitment for a drug-free Punjab’  In a  , the Punjab CM, while batting for the death penalty, stated: “a harsher penalty for even first-time offenders in drug peddling could be a deterrent to those indulging in this illegal activity.” He also mentioned steps taken by his government, including the arrest of over 18,000 drug peddlers in the state, as well as the treatment of addicts. Days later, it was decided to  , including police personnel, from the time they join service through their progression at every stage. While these policy decisions merit a separate discussion, there is a degree of skepticism over the whole “war on drugs” waged by this government. First, Captain Amarinder is accused by many of his party men of being soft on the Badals. This is cited as one of the reasons (by both AAP and Congress leaders) why no action is being taken against top Akali leaders.  Navjot Singh Sidhu, local government minister, not known to get along with former minister Bikramjit Singh Majithia, has in fact asked for stern action against Majithia, citing a  report submitted by IPS Officer Harpreet Sidhu who was handpicked to head the Anti-drug special task force (STF). Second, the chief minister is insulated from MLAs and ministers, and is excessively dependent upon a section of the bureaucracy. This has meant that he is not in sync with the growing resentment not just within the citizenry of the state, but also among his own party men. The inability to take action against key culprits, after the CM had committed to eradicating drugs   of taking over (after being sworn in as Chief of the Punjab Congress in 2015, Amarinder Singh had taken an oath on a Gutka/holy book), has led to criticism of the CM. Third, the nexus between police officers, drug peddlers and even politicians is far deeper than most people think.  Fourth, with a growing perception that the current government has failed to curb the drug menace, there will now be pressure to come up with policies, some of which may be extremely counter-productive and cut-off from ground realities. Recent measures have already been dubbed farcical by many observers of the state’s polity. While these recent announcements may help in grabbing eyeballs and may please a section of activists, another key question is will the police be fair in catching “drug peddlers” (Punjab police is notorious for its high handedness), and will the “big fish” – such as high-level officers and politicians – be caught.  A large number of police officers for instance, are believed to be involved in drug smuggling. While the CM has refused to order enquiries against senior officers, prompting the Opposition to accuse him of “shielding’ them, he has ordered an enquiry against the SSP of Moga, Kanwaljit Singh Dhillon.  Also, the effectiveness of death penalty in dealing with this problem is suspect – there are high chances of this being misused, and it could lead to a blood bath. Misuse of such provisions is not restricted to India.  In his previous tenure, Captain Amarinder Singh was far more inexperienced, but his focus on key governance issues had endeared him to the masses and also resulted in him taking some tough decisions. The nexus which exists between politicians-police and drug peddlers requires political will and strong convictions, more than dramatic announcements.",2018-07-07,"Death penalty,Drug Addiction,Punjab,Captain Amarinder Singh",The many problems with Captain Amarinder Singh’s ‘war on drugs’,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/captain-amarinder-singh-punjab-drugs-addiction/story/1/25342.html
301,Harsh V Pant,"A country once known for its management of diversity, today finds itself in a situation where the only Sikh candidate running in the elections is now dead along with 18 other minorities in a gruesome attack last week. A suicide bomber targeted a group of Sikhs and Hindus on their way to meet Afghanistan’s President in the eastern city of Jalalabad leading to this carnage. The Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the strike targeting a group of “polytheists” was carried out by its Khorasan unit. From around 250,000 Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan before the 1990s, only around 1,000 now remain in the country and those too have been under siege. The sense of desperation is growing among the minorities after the latest attack with some talking of relocating to India. This attack came after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced the end of the government’s unilateral ceasefire and ordered Afghan forces to restart operations across the country. Ghani underlined, somewhat contradictorily, that the ceasefire had been 98 per cent successful and had shown that the majority of the rebels wanted peace, adding that it was now the “Taliban’s turn to give a positive response”. He has indicated that he was ready to extend the ceasefire anytime when the Taliban were ready. The Afghan government’s ceasefire lasted 18 days with one extension and was synchronous with the Taliban’s three-day truce for Eid ul-Fitr. While the three days were unprecedented in the nearly 17-year conflict (in that they saw no fighting), the Taliban did not hold back for the remaining days. Moreover, the ceasefire did not extend to the ISIS which is fast emerging as a potent force in its own right. Ghani had offered to recognise the Taliban as a political group and discuss amendments to the Afghan constitution to make it happen. But it was rejected by the Taliban as they are not interested in talking to Kabul and want to negotiate with the US. In a statement marking the end of their ceasefire on Sunday, the Taliban called on “the invading American party” to “sit directly for dialogue with the Islamic Emirate to find a solution for the ongoing imbroglio”. The US for its part has made it clear that any Afghan peace talks should be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned. The larger reality remains that the Taliban think they are winning on the battlefield and have no interest in engaging the Afghan government. Meanwhile, the Afghan and US forces are having to fight on two fronts — the Taliban and the ISIS. Last year the US even used the most powerful conventional bomb in its arsenal against the ISIS in Nangarhar, underscoring its resolve to take the terror group head on. But the challenge from ISIS in Afghanistan has continued to grow parallel to the Taliban menace. As Afghanistan has entered the election phase, political jostling has also started, compounding security challenges. The Ghani government remains politically divided, with long-delayed parliamentary elections scheduled for October and presidential elections next year. Ghani, an ethnic Pashtun, is often accused of ethnic bias, and regional warlords have started to flex their muscles — as exemplified by the recent revolt by the supporters of Abdul Rashid Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek. Regional situation remains as complex as ever. Despite Ghani talking of an impending Pakistan — Afghanistan pact against terrorism, Pakistan military’s assertion in domestic politics makes any possibility of a sustainable outcome unlikely. China, which has real leverage over Pakistan, has so far not shown any willingness to moderate Pakistani policies vis-à-vis Afghanistan. And Iran is now helping the Taliban in ways unimaginable just a few years back. Shia Iran and Sunni Taliban have been long-time rivals and unlikely bedfellows. But American presence in Afghanistan is reshaping their calculus. Much like the Taliban, Iran wants to see foreign forces leave, and that any government that prevails will at least not threaten its interests, and at best be friendly or aligned with them. Tehran has been providing military support to the Taliban in Afghanistan for some time now but this engagement has reached new heights more recently. Recent reports suggest that hundreds of Taliban fighters are being trained from special forces at Iran’s military academies as part of a significant escalation of support for the insurgents; Iran has also sent Afghans to fight for its ally President Bashar Assad in Syria. US President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal further incentivises Iran to enhance its support to the Taliban. Emboldened by their experience in Syria, Iran and Russia are also working closely in Afghanistan to challenge the US and this primarily means supporting the Taliban with greater vigour. These developments underscore the challenge Afghanistan faces as it moves into an electoral cycle with an unpredictable Trump Administration in Washington as its main supporter. India needs to be aware of the potentially disastrous consequences for its national security if the negative externalities emanating from Afghanistan are not managed effectively.

302,Shiv Visvanathan,"One of the trends that intrigued me about Indian democracy is that our obsession with the Constitution seemed inversely proportional to our interest in citizenship. We see the Constitution as a great discourse, a protean phenomenon, and we are proud of its survival and its transformations. We wave our Constitution like a flag, definite that it is one of our great possessions. While the Constitution exists larger than life, our sense of citizenship seems to have shrunk. Our ideas of citizenship are drab. At best the citizen is a boy scout or an NRI, but in an everyday sense he seems a fragile creation vulnerable to the state, to lynch mobs, to people in power. Citizenship as a concept is apolitical currency we have completely devalued. The hedging of citizenship as a concept took place in the 19th century when the idea blossomed playing itself out against the fragility of exile, migration and the refugee. There was almost a bourgeois permanency to the idea of a citizen. The prefix of the word citizen to a person added to his presence and tangibility. Today the idea of citizenship, despite the proliferation of rights around him, has become a grey and dismal concept. One sees it in the everydayness of India where citizenship becomes Orwellian as some become more equal than others. In fact, the English word “regularise” develops a different range of meanings in Indian languages. Regularisation is a slow, tedious, almost endless process of becoming official. A temporary house becomes permanent. A migrant obtains the divine blessing of a ration card. Temporary electricity tapped illegally becomes a legitimate affair. The temporary shadow of the informal economy cast around citizenship is devastating. He only counts as a citizen at voting time when doles gave him a temporary bonanza of entitlements. Chief ministers like the late Tamil Nadu leader, J Jayalalithaa, turned the dole into the Christmas party of citizenship. The sadness of India’s democracy lies in the process of development. Development involves displacement and, as a result, we create internal refugees which emasculate the idea of citizenship. A citizen inside a country was supposed to be safe but it is internal vulnerability that is vitiating citizenship. Between the violence of development and rioting we have created over 50 million internal refugees. Our sense of citizenship is also snobbish and narrow. It caters to the sedentary middle class, inflating his sense of bourgeois and bureaucratic power. But the tribal, the nomad, the pastoral groups, the marginal farmer, the multitude of minorities are suspect in many ways and have to work harder to earn the halo of citizenship. We see tribals, whether in Niyamgiri or Narmada, as archaic entities who lack the contemporaneity of citizen. The label “backward” becomes a lethal term depriving subsistence groups of citizenship. As theologian and philosopher Ivan Illich once said development is a war against subsistence denying people at that level any claim to citizenship. It is almost as if the Constitution is becoming a schizophrenic document with the notions of development and citizenship acting as counter-currents to each other. The vulnerability of citizenship in the case of tribes, nomads is accentuated further by the status of minorities in a majoritarian society. The majority claims a right of citizenship in terms of electoral power and believes that right includes the power to treat the minority as suspect. The Muslim in India often feels he has to wear his patriotism on his sleeve to remove any suspicion his ethnicity or religious beliefs may cause. In fact, in a slow but devious way, patriotism as a subjective marker has become a substitute for the only activity of citizenship. After many a riot, the Muslim as citizen is still atoning for the alleged sins of his ancestors waiting to the exonerated to enter the Vandalia of citizenship. Citizenship becomes remote or fragile in conditions of internal war where legal provisions like the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) allows unconditional brutality and violence against a citizen. My Kashmiri friends tell me that the conditions of violence, of torture, interrogation, brutality and rape destroy the everyday possibilities of citizenship. Especially for a woman or child, citizenship as an entitlement to a set of civic routines is no longer available. In Assam, the very act of citizenship bill creates demographic tremors, which will disturb the polity. There is a need for a wider debate which goes beyond the narrowness of legality. Citizenship is not merely to guarantee the possibility of law and order; it is a dream of a decent society. A dream which cannot be harshly exclusive but must be warmly encompassing. Nehru’s response to the condition of Tibet and his generosity highlights the creative power of that hospitality. Our treatment of the Rohingya illustrates our indifference to the same vision. The presence of the world’s largest refugee camp in Bangladesh stirs no compassion in the Indian democratic soul. One senses echoes of this in the pandemic of mob lynchings occurring across India. The target of lynching is the migrant who like the minority becomes immediately and essentially suspect and subject to a whole range of violence. His citizenship, his rights even to a hearing seem to dissolve quickly. In fact, the phenomenon of the lynch mob is the greatest internal threat to citizenship. The lynch mob, by seeing itself as a policing extension of the state, substitutes for a condition of rights and a claim to decency. This is sheer barbarism and bestiality. The sadness is that the warmth and the possibilities of citizenship are being emasculated by majoritarianism, development and communalism. One needs a revival of the concept, not as a straw man but as a lived reality with its own politics. One hopes our politics, our ethics, our language and literature rise to the occasion.

303,Aroon Purie,"Women political leaders in India either inherit their parties from family members or from their mentors. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is a remarkable exception. Her political start-up, the All India Trina­mool Congress, which she founded after breaking away from the Indian National Congress in 1998, completed 20 eventful years this January. In this time, she ejected the Communists from West Bengal in 2011, a bastion they held for 34 years, and made her party a force to reckon with after bagging a second term in 2016. Clearly, no longer content with being a provincial satrap, ""Didi"" is now eyeing a bigger role for herself and her party at the Centre. She is making frequent trips around the country, cobbling together support for a united Opposition, meeting up with leaders like N Chandrababu Naidu, Arvind Kejriwal and K Chandrashekar Rao and brushing up her Hindi. It’s not hard to see why she sees herself as the potential nucleus of a united Opposition. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, a contender for the role, was weaned away by the BJP in 2017. The May 2019 Lok Sabha election increasingly appears to be one where the Congress will fight as first among equals. Rahul Gandhi is yet to display the stamina, tenacity, aggression or the unpredictability a challenger will need to bring into the fight against the formidable Narendra Modi. Mamata Banerjee has all these attributes in spades and clearly this is the reason many opposition veterans, from Sharad Pawar to Chandrababu Naidu to Sharad Yadav and Lalu Prasad Yadav, have endorsed her candidature, seeing her as someone who will consolidate and unite the Opposition and forge a front that could dethrone the NDA next year. Her detractors in the Congress fear she is planning a coalition minus them to call the shots and bargain for the top post after the elections. They have every reason to be apprehensive. This instinctive politician has been on our cover twice, both times for her ability to pull off surprises. Knocking out the Left in May 2011 (Marx Meets Mamata) and storming out of UPA-II in April 2, 2012 (Hurricane in a Hurry). Her third cover comes even as the ruling BJP feels the heat of rising public discontent and successive by-election defeats. The BJP, the West Bengal CM feels, has peaked, and sooner than later, the law of averages will catch up. In consistently speaking out against the central government’s policies — from demonetisation to GST, to the linking of Aadhaar to mobile numbers — as well as on atrocities on Dalits and the recent spate of lynchings, she has positioned herself as a rival. Her attacks against Prime Minister Modi have become less strident of late, but there is no mistaking the fact that she considers herself a prime contender. In an exclusive interview with Group Editorial Director Raj Chengappa, her most detailed interaction with a publication yet, the inscrutable Mamata Banerjee outlined her strategy for 2019 — electoral tie-ups in a limited number of seats between regional parties to dent the BJP’s chances are part of the plan. “If it (an electoral tie-up) is done for 75 seats… then the game will be over…” says Mamata. Chengappa, who spent an hour and 15 minutes with her, says, “She was feisty but focused. Her strength is her simplicity and ability to remain grounded.” The only trouble is the popular perception that Mamata currently has nothing to offer beyond electoral math. She has opposed most of the government’s policies, but is yet to articulate an alternative narrative of development. As the potential leader of a united Opposition, she will have the still bigger task of convincing the electorate that a united front is worth more than the sum of its parts and that her charisma extends beyond her state.

304,Niranjan Sahoo,"The wait is finally over. After more than two years, the five-member Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court delivered a 535-page unanimous  on the constitutional status of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD). The unique aspect about the ""Government of NCT Delhi versus Union of India"" judgement is that not only was the case argued by heavyweights including P Chidambaram, former Finance Minister and senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan among others, the verdict contained three different judgments. While the Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra drafted a majority opinion on behalf of justices A M Khanwilkar and A K Sikri, Justices D Y Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan wrote their own judgements. The unanimous judgement that strongly reiterated the constitutional position of respective actors in the national capital territory, viz the LG and the Council of Ministers, is also a brilliant exposition on the rule of law, principles of participatory democracy and collaborative federalism, the concept of limited power and constitutional morality.   While it is not easy to capture the essence of a voluminous verdict containing three separate judgements in a column, a few observations are in order. First, the judgement does well to restore the constitutional position of the respective governing agents in Delhi as envisaged in the 69th Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1991 — in doing this, the SC Bench overturned an erroneous 2016 judgment of the Delhi High Court that had completely sided with the LG and the Union Government. Going against the letter and spirit of the 69th Amendment, the single-judge Bench under Chief Justice G Rohini ruled that the   of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD), thereby not required to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers, even in areas that are exclusive domains of the elected government.  Notwithstanding the differences in their approaches now, the justices were unanimous in restoring the primacy of the elected government on matters that have been listed in the 69th Amendment Act, 1991, especially Article 239AA. They were loud and unanimous in saying that the role of the LG has “no independent powers of his own” and thereby has to act as per the “aid and advise” of the Council of Ministers. In doing this, the Bench has restored the rule of law in favour of the GNCTD. Second, beyond the executive powers, the verdict restored the primacy of the Legislative Assembly in law-making on all subjects listed in the State and Concurrent Lists, other than reserve subjects, such as public order, police and land — the Delhi High Court had taken away or restricted such sovereign powers of the legislature. Reaffirming the principles of parliamentary democracy, the bench said that a legislative assembly without law-making powers will nullify the very idea of representative democracy that represents “the popular will”. Third, the SC Bench has shown strong resolve to redraw the boundaries of the LG’s discretionary powers under Article 239AA. Unfortunately, the Constitution is silent on this key power enjoyed by the LG. All three separate judgements have gone to a great length to cite constitutional morality and principles of collaborative federalism to limit the discretionary powers to “exceptional” cases. It noted that being a constitutional functionary, the LG cannot act “mechanically” but with “judgement and reasons and objectivity” as underlined in a constitutional office. Justice Chandrachud took a step further by restricting discretionary reference to “substantial issues of finance and policy which impact upon the status of the national capital or implicate vital interests of the Union”. Finally, the judgement also had a message for Delhi’s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his insurgent party. While it took exception to the “absolute powers” of the LG, the Bench at the same time warned against “anarchism” of the ruling party in Delhi — without discounting the hostile attitudes of the Union Government, it must be noted that much of the tussles and governance breakdown in Delhi has been largely due to the confrontational attitudes of the Aam Aadmi Party. Reading together the 1991 GNCTD Act and the Transaction of Business Rules, 1993, the bench concluded that the mandated political process for the resolution of disagreements between the GNCTD and the LG was by communication and dialogue, based on the principles of “collaborative federalism”. Making an idealist pitch, the justices called on the LG and CM to work “harmoniously” for the betterment of the national capital territory. To sum up, the judgment is rich in deliberation and very vocal in its recognition of the primacy of an elected government in the national capital. It has been able to swing the balance — except in the reserve subjects — in favour of the Delhi government. Yet, the big question is — will this judgement, which many claim as ""landmark"" or ""historic"", address Delhi’s major governance challenges? Very unlikely. While the judgment does well to reaffirm the primacy of the elected government in the national capital and goes to great lengths to caution the LG and the Union Government while exercising its “exceptional” powers, it hardly does anything to remove ambiguities in Article 239AA and the Rules of Business. The LG and the Union Government have enormous powers to needle the elected government, including in routine day-to-day functions. For instance, hours after the judgment, the deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s order of withdrawing all powers of transfer and posting of IAS officers from the LG was returned to him by the services department. In short, the judiciary is no answer to the cynical adversarial politics that the national capital has descended into since 2015.  However, the bigger disappointment over the judgment is that it missed out the golden opportunity to recalibrate the balance on reserve subjects that are linked to Delhi’s status as the national capital — it would have been really landmark had the judges taken the liberty to expand or reinterpret existing constitutional principles and governance best practices such as subsidiarity and devolution to provide greater space to the elected government of a megacity that is going to grow even bigger in the years to come. Reserve subjects — particularly land and policing — are vital to a city government. It is quite unusual that an elected government representing a population larger than many Indian states practically has no say on critical areas such as land and policing. Even in Washington D.C, the most restricted capital territory, the elected mayor shares power over policing.   Global trends suggest that many national governments, which earlier had apprehensions about sharing police powers, have gradually begun ceding such powers with the national capital governments. Delhi clearly bucks the global trend and the Supreme Court bench had a rare opportunity to weigh these jurisdictional issues, let alone statehood which was never in the menu. In that sense, the judgment is a missed opportunity in setting many things right in the national capital.",2018-07-05,"Delhi Government,Anil Baijal,Aap-l-g tussle,Supreme Court",SC gives back Delhi's elected government its powers — but misses a historical chance,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-aam-aadmi-party-lg-anil-baijal-supreme-court-aapvslg-delhi-governance/story/1/25303.html
305,TS Sudhir,"HD Deve Gowda has always projected himself as a leader of farmers. On Thursday, his son HD Kumaraswamy decided to walk the talk by waiving farm loans of up to Rs 2 lakh per farmer household, borrowed till December 31, 2017. This would mean that Rs 34,000 crore will get transferred from the farmer's head to the state of Karnataka. Everyone knew this was coming. After all, the JD(S) had promised in its manifesto that it will waive all farm loans totalling Rs 53,000 crore within 24 hours of assuming office. However, with just 38 seats in its kitty, Kumaraswamy promised to do a phased roll-out, citing the reason that Karnataka did not give him a full majority to fulfil his promise. Where will the money come from, was the concern everyone had. After all, in his budget presented in February, former chief minister Siddaramaiah had estimated revenue receipts at Rs 1.62 lakh crore. Assuming that is more or less the figure that the Karnataka exchequer gets by March 2019, the farm loan waiver is close to 20 per cent of that amount. Kumaraswamy has decided to pinch just about everyone's pocket in order to partially fund this largesse. Tax on fuel has been hiked by two per cent — which means petrol prices have been increased by Rs 1.14 per litre, diesel by Rs 1.12 per litre. Excise tax on liquor is up by 4 per cent while the power tariff is up by 20 paise per unit. He has not spared the poor households either, reducing the rice given under the Anna Bhagya scheme from 7 kg to 5 kg. What the budget announcement does is pit the Congress-JD(S) against the BJP in the constituency of the farmer. The battle is about who will win the agrarian vote in 2019. The announcement inside the Vidhana Soudha is significant because this comes within hours of the NDA government hiking the Minimum Support Price (MSP) on crops. Kumaraswamy's budget is the opposition's riposte to tell the farmer, not just in Karnataka but also across the country, that Narendra Modi is not the sole friend of the farmers. Don't forget, the Karnataka model of coalition governance is the Congress’s way of telling the country that it can help replicate a similar arrangement in New Delhi in 2019 as well. Kumaraswamy has tried his best to please the farm sector but it is unlikely that everyone will be happy. By fixing the loan waiver upper limit at Rs 2 lakh per farming family, Kumaraswamy has made it clear that he wants to help the small and marginal farmer who, in most cases, would be either a tenant farmer or someone with very small landholding. And as is the case with most farm loan waivers, it applies only to institutional credit — which means loans borrowed from private moneylenders will not be waived. This decision was taken based on National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data released in 2017 that showed that though local moneylenders are portrayed as instrumental in pushing indebted farmers to suicide, 80 per cent of farmers killed themselves in 2015 due to inability to repay loans borrowed from banks or microfinance institutions. The reason is that banks are usually inflexible with regard to delaying repayment dates while the moneylender, who is many a time a relative or a neighbour in the village, is more adjusting if he is promised a further hike in the rate of interest. In order to ensure the waiver does not discourage the non-defaulting farmer, the government will credit the repaid loan amount or Rs 25,000, whichever is less. But what is most certain to happen is that farmers will now expect the next tranche of loan waiver in the next budget in February-March and that may make several farmers default on payments. PSU banks with huge exposure to farm loans feel this will not help the credit culture and are only hoping the government will reimburse their money within this fiscal. Siddaramaiah initially was not in favour of Kumaraswamy presenting a full budget because the former CM perhaps felt it would steal the thunder from his February budget and also perhaps cut funds for the welfare schemes of the previous Congress government. But barring the tinkering with the quantity of rice, Kumaraswamy has not taken anything away from the Congress budget. In fact, he has decided to add another 247 Indira canteens at a cost of Rs 211 crore, in order to please his coalition partner. It is obvious this is an election budget. The focus is clearly on rural Karnataka and Bengaluru city, where the Congress-JD(S) will hope to wrest seats from the BJP. Among other sops for the capital city, the budget promises to build a peripheral ring road around Bangalore for Rs 11,000 crore and six elevated corridors for Rs 15,800 crore. Perhaps keeping the JD(S) stronghold of south Karnataka in mind, the budget goodies seem skewed in the region's favour. Among other projects, Mysore city will receive Cauvery water, Mandya will get Rs 50 crore package to develop the city, Chikkaballapur will get a science centre and a silk trading centre will be set up in Mysore. A film university for Rs 30 crore will also be set up in Kumaraswamy's constituency, Ramnagara on the outskirts of Bangalore. No one will grudge film producer-turned-politician Kumaraswamy's choice of place because Ramnagara after all is   territory, where Ramesh Sippy's iconic film was shot in the 1970s.",2018-07-05,"Farmer crisis,Minimum support price,HD Deve Gowda,Hd kumaraswamy","HD Kumaraswamy's Rs 34,000-crore farmer loan waiver is a gift to Opposition",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/congress-jds-hd-kumaraswamy-karnataka-farmers-minimum-support-price/story/1/25298.html
306,Ananth Krishnan,"Parsing the outcomes of the “Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs”, to give it its full name, may not sound an entirely appealing endeavour. But the two-day gathering of top Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and government officials that ended in Beijing on June 23 is certainly worth paying attention to: it could herald significant shifts in China’s relations with the world — and be of far-reaching importance to India as well. Much of the two-day deliberations remained behind-closed doors, but President Xi Jinping’s lengthy report, submitted to the conference, carries several clues on how he plans to take forward Chinese diplomacy. Xi listed 10 areas of priority, starting with “upholding the authority of the party” and “strengthening the centralised, unified leadership of the party on external work”. In other words, a greater role for the CPC and its International Liaison Department, which had earlier largely relegated the role of diplomacy to the bureaucrats of the foreign ministry. Now, the party is back. The ILD has generally focused on party-to-party ties with other nations — its ministers have recently visited India and met with both BJP and Congress leaders — but it could now take on a weightier role, especially at a time when China has been talking about “sharing lessons” and promoting its authoritarian capitalist developmental model abroad. The Belt and Road Initiative was also on the list, with Xi saying China would “forge ahead” with the BRI. For India, this could mean dealing with a continued Chinese emphasis to deepen its economic presence in the neighbourhood through the BRI. Xi summed up China’s goal as to “advance major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics to fulfill the mission of realising national rejuvenation”. This means focusing on relations with major powers — the US, Russia, EU and closer to home Japan and India, among others — to ensure China has a stable periphery and favourable international environment for its rise. Top of the list will be navigating a looming trade war with the US, while China continues with its mending of fences with India and Japan, at least for the time being as it deals with the US and the unfolding changes on the Korean peninsula. He said another priority would be to “take national core interests as the bottom line to safeguard China’s sovereignty, security and development interests”, which means no compromises on its territorial disputes. Xi also hinted at a greater global role for China, from “enhancing strategic confidence” to “developing global partnerships while advancing diplomatic agenda” and “leading the reform of the global governance system”. Central work conferences are important events in China — this is only the second Xi has convened on foreign policy and the first in his second term. The idea is to push this carefully thought-out strategic plan across all sections of the Chinese government, from the military to its state-owned enterprises as they push China’s interests abroad.

307,Amit Sengupta,"Assam is on the brink of a huge and invisible crisis. Its beautiful landscape, annually ravaged by the fiery floods in the Brahmaputra valley, across its green geography, is currently ridden with widespread fear and insecurity, mass phobia and trauma. Indeed, this could lead to fissures and ruptures in the social fabric of this sensitive and strategic border state in northeast of India, and could move beyond redemption. The current crisis revolves around two issues which have hit at the core of the state's social and political identity: the   (NRC) and the proposed  . The bill, which was first tabled in Parliament on July 15, 2016, is backed by the ruling BJP, while it is being vehemently opposed by All Assam Students Union (AASU) and its political front, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP). The NRC is backed by both the BJP and AGP. The AGP is now in alliance with BJP in Assam to ""stop the Congress and help the state recover from its bad governance"". The Congress was in power in the state for 15 years with Tarun Gogoi as chief minister until it was defeated in the last Assembly elections in 2016. However, Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, founder president of AASU, and two-time chief minister of the state, told this columnist categorically in Guwahati on June 29 that the ""AGP will break the alliance with the BJP if it pushes the Citizenship Amendment Bill"". The AASU led a big rally in Guwahati on June 29, and there were protests across the state on the issue. The party is convinced that the 'original inhabitants' of Assam and its indigenous people are already facing the brunt of massive demographic changes because of the influx of refugees post-Partition in 1947. The situation is such that it is argued that they will become a linguistic minority in the face of the new influx if the bill is passed — pointing to the10 per cent Bengali-Hindus now based in 'secular' Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina's leadership. If the bill is passed, Assam will become a ""dumping ground"" for Bangladeshi Hindus, they contend. The Citizenship Bill seeks to radically transform the category of 'illegal migrants'. The bill will amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, to provide citizenship to illegal migrants from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, who are of Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist, Jain, or Christian origin. Muslims are not included in this Bill, including those who are facing persecution in Pakistan, such as the Ahmadiyyas. This schizophrenia originally emerged from the contentious 'foreigners' issue which has stalked Assam's borders and mainland since the Partition of India in 1947. It deepened after the Bangladesh War of Liberation in 1971 in which India actively participated and which led to tens of thousands of refugees camping in India. The protracted and often violent movement on the foreigners' issue led by the All Assam Students' Union from 1979 to 1987, which rocked the state, and whose reverberations are still felt across the interiors, also added to the fears. The Nellie massacre of February 18, 1983, with the guilty not punished till date, is still etched in the minds of the people. However, the most predominant fissure that might mark a new phase of deep division and insecurity is the process of detection of ""foreigners"" under the NRC, spearheaded and fast-tracked by the BJP-led regime, under the supervision of the Supreme Court. The NRC had released its first report on December 31, 2016, in which 1.9 crore of the 3.29 crore applicants were declared as 'Indian citizens'. The second and final report (to be reportedly revised once again in December 2018) was meant to be released on June 30. However, it has been postponed till July 30, due to floods, as stated by the authorities, under the auspices of the apex court. Under the Assam Accord, the midnight of August 24, 1971, is the cut-off date for citizens to be declared Indians. Any individual who has entered Assam after that date will be declared 'foreigner'. A massive exercise like checking out credentials of lakhs of individuals as bonafide Indian citizens or foreigners is a priori a gigantic and complex task. It has thereby fallen into a trap of accusations of bias, prejudice, and partisan conduct, with widespread controversies, confirmed and unconfirmed reports of fudging of evidence, racial and chauvinistic profiling, targeting of minorities, questionable, illegal and arbitrary detentions and arrests, and large-scale unrest and phobia. Thousands of citizens are under the scanner of the 100 Foreigners' Tribunal, running to and fro from this hearing to that, holding bagful of documents (16 crucial documents are required, reportedly), trying to prove their citizenship. If they have to appeal - they have to approach the one-judge divisional bench of the Gauhati High Court, something most of them find extremely difficult to do. If the high court bench rejects their appeal, they have to go back to the tribunal else they are simply declared as 'Doubtful Voters (D-Voter)' with a 'D' marked against their names in the electoral list. They can then be branded as a foreigner in other cases and packed off to jail, which serve as detention centres. In the 'detention centres', they have no prison rights and are treated as 'undertrials. They are condemned as 'foreigners', this includes even those voters who are under scrutiny because of technical or official anomalies in their documents. It is an arduous, difficult and sensitive exercise directly affecting thousands of families, their emotional and national identity, their social life, and livelihood. In many cases, families, especially the poor and illiterate, are ravaged, torn apart, and pushed to the brink of devastation. And this can run into tens of thousands because the 'D-Voter' list itself goes beyond the official 1.25 lakh mark, and might only be rising. Unofficial estimates by activists claim that 35 lakh or more people might be affected by this NRC exercise. Most of those directly impacted are Bengali-speaking Hindus and Muslims. Most of them are poor and inhabitants of far-flung areas. A large number of women have been declared D-Voters because they have no birth/school certificates, no marriage documents and many of them have never voted. The panchayat certificate with magisterial powers was declared null and void by the court, but was accepted finally by the Supreme Court. Despite this there are allegations that the Foreigners' Tribunal (often accused of bias by locals with the allegation that those sympathetic to BJP-RSS and AASU have taken over the tribunals) refuses to accept the panchayat certificate as a valid document. This columnist found a Hindu Rajbangshi husband in a village in Chirang, Kokrajhar who has been declared a bonafide Indian citizen but his aged wife, however, has been packed off to jail as a 'foreigner'. An old woman in Jaipur village in Barpeta district is rotting in a Kokrajhar detention camp for the last three years though all her sons have been declared Indian citizens. A young pregnant woman in Krishna Charali village in Goalpara district might have her entire family declared as Indians, but she was picked up by the police before a court hearing and packed off to a detention camp as a 'D-Voter'. The woman was released on bail at the time of her delivery. She doesn't even know what her crime is. Could it be because her primary and middle school certificate had technical anomalies? Entire blocks and villages have been branded as 'doubtful' only to be later declared as citizens. Thousands have not been served notices for hearing at the tribunal, and majority of villages have no access to their names being listed on internet.

308,Makarand R Paranjape,"About India, Bill Gates, long the world’s richest man and still its biggest philanthropist, a keen India watcher in his own right, remarked: “Most trends are positive, but my biggest disappointment when it comes to India is the education system. It should be far better.” You don’t have to be Bill Gates to know that our education system needs a root and branch reform, from nursery to PhD. In fact, one of the pet peeves of many a Narendra Modi supporter is that his administration hasn’t done nearly enough to transform this sector. At last, just a year before it finishes term, the government seems to have a taken a sankalp to make a difference, at least when it comes to higher education. Early morning of June 27, HRD minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted: “Under the leadership of PM @narendramodi has embarked on a process of reforms of the regulatory agencies for better administration of the HE sector. In a landmark decision, a draft Act for repeal of #UGC & setting up #HECI (Higher Education Commission of India) has been prepared.” The draft bill of the HEC Act, uploaded on the ministry website, is open to public comment and feedback till July 7. Having looked at the draft, I, for one, welcome it. Not only was it prepared after examining several possibilities and suggestions, but was the outcome of the recommendations of a consultative committee set up for the purpose. According to Javadekar, its main aim is to accord “more autonomy to higher educational institutes to promote excellence and facilitate holistic growth of the education system.” This sounds like a noble endeavour, one that few would care to oppose. But the real merit of the proposed HEC, in my view, is that it would separate grant-giving, which had become the UGC’s principal function, from regulatory responsibility. In addition, the HEC would be committed to encourage and enforce quality, not just equity. Actually, in this instance too, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. There is a real fear in many quarters that the HEC would end up becoming a lame duck or, worse, be sabotaged by vested interests. How to prevent such an eventuality is a challenge that the HRD ministry must anticipate and prevent. How to do this? If I were to sum it up in one word, it would be to depoliticise higher education. By “politics” I neither mean the aspiration to improve society or participate in student government. Nor do I mean the capacity to resist injustice or tyranny, which well-intentioned and well-informed youth in democratic polity ought to do. Indeed, the honourable minister himself, as an ABVP leader, resisted Emergency and went to jail during his student days. The real problem is to play caste, community, and other forms of entitlement politics in higher education at the cost of real competence or merit. Indeed, in certain politically over-correct circles, the latter word is anathema, nothing short of “neo-Brahminism”. Many of our campuses are also invaded if not infested with “urban Naxals”, boldly depicted by friend and filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri as sworn enemies of the state. Whether we agree entirely with him or not, much of what passes for research or scholarship, especially in the humanities and social studies, is arguably little else than “anti-nationalism” in some garb or the other. Obviously, this must end. Universities should not be breeding grounds for political activists and parasites. They must produce also real research and equip their graduates, especially doctoral students, to become excellent and inspiring teachers. Likewise, an undergraduate college should not just be “masti ki pathshala”, where the young have fun, chilling and keeping off the streets, but forced to get useless degrees, with outdated and irrelevant curricula. Re-intellectualising higher education, making it meaningful again, is the crying need of the hour. We must improve standards so that India can be competitive in a global marketplace, rather than just exporting out best (wo)manpower. I do hope that the HEC works to ensure this. It is equally important to de-recognise, even close down a number of colleges and universities, which repeatedly fail to meet benchmarks, and to stop sanctioning new ones just because some politician, well-connected person or special interest group is promoting them. Certainly, it is time to stop funding such swindles with government money in addition to giving them subsidised land and other exemptions. Serious and genuine pondering is also required to rethink more touchy and sensitive topics such as reservations and minority institutions. Again, the watchword is quality not just equality. If everything else is equal, certainly support, even promote the socially and economically disadvantaged. Even offer such sections of society extra points or incentives. But no compromise of quality and competence in favour of appeasement, compensation or entitlement. The same methodology must be used to permit, regulate and evaluate private, including foreign universities, to set up shop in India. Certification should be based on enforceable and transparent criteria lest gullible and vulnerable students are misled or exploited. Finally, top Indian institutions should be encouraged to open branches abroad so that brand India flourishes in the highly competitive higher education market too. To sum up, the HEC is certainly a good idea, but it has its work cut out if it is to be a real improvement on the UGC.

309,Rajeev Sharma,"The increasing trend of white collar criminals first systematically looting public sector banks, then leaving the country when their misdeeds tumble out of the closet and finally making a song and dance about their ""sincere"" intentions to pay back the money (much less than their actual dues) when long hands of law are about to reach their necks shows that the government needs to get its act together to stay ahead in this cat and mouse game. This is what scamster diamantaire Nirav Modi did recently. Now, another scam accused   has done the same. Mallya has gone a step ahead and earlier this week made public his letters which he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley on April 15, 2016, and released a long media statement to give his own version for the first time — essentially a quasi-legal and PR exercise aimed at projecting himself as more sinned against than sinning. Following are the major points which Mallya has made: a) I have been accused by politicians and the media alike of having stolen and run away with Rs 9,000 crore that was loaned to Kingfisher Airlines (KFA). Some of the lending banks have also labelled me a wilful defaulter. b) The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) have filed chargesheets against me with various untenable and blatantly false allegations acting at the behest of the government and lending banks. The ED have also attached assets belonging to me, my group companies and companies owned and/or controlled by my family under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) currently valued at approximately Rs 13,900 crore. c) I have become the ""poster boy"" of bank default and a lightning rod of public anger. I wrote letters to both the prime minister and the finance minister on April 15, 2016, and am making these letters public to put things in the right perspective. No response was received from either of them. d) I made two settlement offers to the banks when proceedings were filed by them in the honourable Supreme Court of India on March 29, 2016, and April 6, 2016. Against the then outstanding principal amount of approximately Rs 5,000 crore, my first offer was for Rs 4,000 crore (plus the assignment of a claim in a pending suit of approximately Rs 2,000 crore), which was subsequently revised to Rs 4,400 crore (plus the assignment of the claim in the pending suit of approximately Rs 2,000 crore). These two offers need to be viewed in the context of one-time settlements made between public sector banks and borrowers in the past and more recently the bank partial recoveries with significant haircuts under the Indian Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code before the National Company Law Tribunal. These two offers are part of the public record in Supreme Court proceedings. Both offers were rejected by the banks — the second revised offer was rejected outright by a junior SBI officer present in court without reference to any of the other banks. e) ED attachments under PMLA: 1) Two attachments have been made of assets valued in excess of Rs 9,600 crore on the pretext that guarantors were refusing to honour their corporate/personal guarantees to repay Banks which allegedly was a fraudulent intention, and hence, all assets have been treated as ""proceeds of crime"". 2) The ED has even attached assets acquired in 1902, inherited assets and assets acquired even before KFA was formed. f) Recovery of loans is a civil matter which has been criminalised in my case. The CBI and ED moving aggressively to recover bank loans is unprecedented despite my best intentions to settle with the banks. The question is why has the fugitive tycoon woken up now and reached out to the media with his side of the story? His settlement offer, which is a kind of plea bargain prevalent in the western world that doesn't have much traction in India, came a day before a special ED court was to take up a case to declare him a fugitive and allow it to confiscate his assets. There is only one credible explanation for his desperation - that he is feeling the heat and is probably getting negative vibes about his ongoing extradition proceedings in UK. It doesn't take rocket science to understand his real motive in suddenly going on a publicity blitzkrieg - this gives him an opportunity to project to British courts that he is not a fraudster or a dishonest businessman but a failed businessman, who incurred huge losses. So, his strategy is to buck the main accusation against him of fraud and portray a positive image of himself that he made valiant attempts to repay despite a genuine business failure. Moreover, it will be difficult for the authorities to recover dues by seizing and auctioning his personal assets unless they prove charges of fraud and criminal conspiracy. The fact of the matter is that Mallya has become a political football. The Narendra Modi government is sensing a massive political opportunity in the Mallya episode. The Modi-led BJP will get a powerful shot in the arm just before next general elections if Mallya were to be extradited to India, even if with strings attached. That's why the Modi government isn't showing any interest in Mallya's offer. It's definitely a good idea to realise the entire dues from Mallya — not a penny less, not a penny more. Therefore, leaving out a few thousand crores of rupees to get whatever can be extracted from him may not be good politics for the BJP. But what about the judiciary? Hasn't the Supreme Court adopted different yardsticks in case of Sahara group owner Subrata Roy? Isn't it because of the fact that Roy didn't flee the country like Mallya and other white collar criminals did? Won't it encourage all such criminals in the future to do a Vijay Mallya rather than a Subrata Roy?",2018-07-01,"Black Money,Nirav Modi,Mallya extradition,Vijay Mallya",Why is Modi government not showing interest in Vijay Mallya's plea bargain,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/vijay-mallya-mallya-extradition-nirav-modi-cbi-ed-modi-government-black-money/story/1/25211.html
310,Mausami Singh,"Ahead of the monsoon session of the Parliament, the government and the Opposition are set for yet another confrontation, with battle lines drawn over the election of the deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha. The election to the post will be held after 26 years — the last one was in 1992.  Having burnt its fingers during the election for the Vice President of India — when Janta Dal (United) pulled out of the Opposition camp to side with the NDA — the Congress is now ready to bend over backwards for a consensus candidate from the Opposition.  ""We will decide on who contests for the post only after a consensus within the Opposition parties is arrived at. A meeting of all Opposition parties will be called in the first week of July,"" said a senior congress leader, not willing to be named.  Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has been quick to throw her party's hat in the ring. With TMC being the fourth largest party with 13 members in the Upper House, the firebrand leader has sensed an opportunity to bag the prestigious post. For a Congress candidate, the resistance comes from regional parties — Telangana Rashtriya Samiti (TRS), Telugu Desam Party (TDP) the AAP and the Biju Janta Dal (BJD) — whose aversion to the Congress is no secret. They would, however, support a TMC candidate.  Keeping its distance from the recent tussle between the AAP and the LG in Delhi hasn't helped the Congress' ambition of playing the lead role in cobbling up a Opposition alliance for the General Elections. Now, sources indicate that the Congress is likely to support a TMC candidate. This could be a well thought-out political move, considering the Congress would want a strong Opposition to effectively take on the mighty BJP in 2019. The NCP is also willing to put its weight behind Mamata. Needless to say, her good equation with Sharad Pawar has helped.  However, the BJD, with 9 members in the Rajya sabha, is the dark horse that could switch either way and tilt the balance. Party chief Naveen Patnaik has followed the policy of maintaining equal distance from both the BJP and the Congress. Mamata is trying to woo the BJD, but the latter is skeptical about its own possible candidate, Prasanna Acharya, who might not reach the finish line. The BJD is watching the game as it keeps its options open. Though a decision is yet to be taken, a senior leader of the party said they could support a non-political nominated member. ""We are willing to support a nominated candidate for the post, but no call has been taken yet,"" he said.  A party would require 122 votes to win the election, with a total of 245 members in the House. At present, the BJP has 67 members, and the Congress 51  The TMC has already floated the name of party leader Sukhendu Sekhar Roy to test political waters. However, officially, the party has maintained that there has been ""No decision on the Opposition's candidate yet. We have not put up any name. The united Opposition will come up with a name,"" RS member and TMC leader Derek O Brien has said.  The post of the deputy chairman will be vacated by PJ Kurien in the end of June. The election for the post will be held during the monsoon session, scheduled to begin from  .

311,Harmeet Shah Singh,"Kabir's year of birth is unclear. Some say the iconoclast mystic poet was born in 1398, some 1440.  But what's certain is he lived most of his life in Benares – now Varanasi. In his own writings, he called himself a julaha, or a weaver. He was fiercely critical of rituals, both Hindu and Muslim, the clergy, and beliefs he regarded as fanatically superstitious.  In the primary Sikh scripture, Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Kabir’s writings make up the largest part of the  , a generic term for the writings of contributors other than the Gurus.  When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Kabir’s samadhi in Maghar recently, some political pundits were quick to presume that it   his reach among the Dalits. I don't fully agree with their conclusion, because Kabir’s Maghar worldview flies in the face of Modi's existing support base.  Undoubtedly, the spiritual poet is loved by a large number of Hindus and Muslims. His thoughts did also shape up the Kabir Panth, a sect that draws its members specially – but not exclusively – from the Dalit community. That said, the name Kabir, in the present democratic politics, doesn't inspire any organised vote bloc. But what it does is symbolise a total rejection of doctrines that form the centre-piece of Modi’s Varanasi.  In his falling years, Kabir chose Maghar over Kashi. The former discarded by the Hindu clergy as a gateway to hell, and the latter worshipped as a ladder of salvation.  The belief still persists, especially among the Hindu faithful with deep reverence for Varanasi.  Back then though, Kabir levelled both of them. Rather, he described the time he spent in Benares as a futile exercise. ""Taji Le Benares, Mat Bhai Bori,"" reads his verse in Sri Guru Granth Sahib, meaning ""I left Benares; I lost sense."" ""Sagal Janam Siv Puri Gawaiya; Marti Baar Maghar Uth Aiya,"" Kabir continues. ""I wasted my whole life in the town of Shiv but moved to Maghar at the time of my death."" He juxtaposed both the places, otherwise diametrically opposite in the contemporary Hindu tradition. ""Kaasi Maghar Sam Bichari; Ochchi Bhagat Kaisey Utras Paari” – “I regard both Maghar and Kashi as the same. How can you swim across with inadequate devotion (be it in Kashi or in Maghar)?”  In a separate hymn, he again denounces notions of divinity linked to geographical locations.  “Kya Kaasi, Kya Ookhar Maghar Ram Riday Jao Hoi” – “What's the difference between Kashi and a barren Maghar when divinity resides within?” In another composition, he elevates Maghar above Varanasi in the realm of spirituality. “Torey Bharose Maghar Basiyo, Mere Man Ki Tapat Bhujai; Pehle Darsan Maghar Paiyo, Phun Kaasi Basey Aaee” – “I relied upon You to douse my internal fire. I sighted Your vision in Maghar before I turned to Kashi.” Kabir’s school of thought also stands in complete contrast to the BJP's brand of Hindutva. “What really counted, for Kabir, was utter fidelity to the one deathless truth of life, which he associated equally with the designations Allah and Ram — the latter understood as a general Hindu name for the divine,""  in a chapter on the saint.  No one's good, no one's evil, Kabir wrote. All are Allah’s creations – “Awal Allah Noor Upaaya, Kudrat Ke Sab Bande; Ek Noor Te Sab Jag Upjiya, Kaon Bhalle, Ko Mande."" In a nutshell, Kabir tore into Hindu and Muslim orthodoxies. He opposed idol worship and circumcision alike. He rejected holy dips and theories of heaven and hell. He condemned the caste system. Kabir focused solely on humility. His world was inner. His purpose of life: quiet contemplation. Whether or not Modi's Maghar tour strikes a chord with the larger Dalit vote bloc, his gesture is surely a bold move, given sentiments of his tried-and-tested constituency embodied in Varanasi. Remember how he   after filing his Lok Sabha nomination in 2014: “I thought I was going to Kashi. But now I realise I was neither sent nor I came here on my own. I am here at the call of Mother Ganga.” In the last year of his term, Modi is in Maghar – an antithesis to Varanasi in Hindu philosophy. Indeed, an audacious leader.  ",2018-06-30,"2019 general elections,Kabir,Maghar,Narendra Modi",How Kabir's Maghar defies Modi's constituency Kashi,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-maghar-kabir-varanasi-dalits-2019-general-elections/story/1/25208.html
312,Rahul Noronha,"Madhya Pradesh is in the throes of a political cyberwar. Last week, social media was flooded with a video clip of a morphed Shivraj Singh Chouhan thrashing his enemies, mostly top Congress leaders from the state. Soon afterwards, a video clip surfaced with a morphed image of Kamal Nath as batsman hitting BJP leaders for six sixes in an over. Not a week passes without the BJP or the Congress not coming out with a morphed video clip showing prominent leaders of either party attacking each other, sometimes even physically. The videos are usually clips of movies with faces of actors morphed with images of leaders from MP. The original lines are replaced with lip synced versions of what the politicians would want voters to hear. Elections in Madhya Pradesh are about five months away. The frequency of these videos appearing has increased as the state moves closer towards the polls. Both the BJP and the Congress have put together a team that would battle it out in the cyber world. Last week, when BJP president Amit Shah was in Jabalpur, he asked party workers to work as “cyber yoddhas” (cyber warriors) to tell people about the work done by BJP state and Union government. There are a total of 65,000 cyber yoddhas who would be working for the BJP of which about 5,000 would be in Madhya Pradesh. Taking the cue, the Congress too announced the formation of a group called “Rajeev ke Sipahi” under its Information Technology (IT) cell. The group has been so named in deference to Rajeev Gandhi who, according to the Congress, helped bring IT to the nation. The sipahis in the Congress army are to counter any propaganda that they feel that the BJP IT has planted in social media. While the stated objective of the cyber yoddhas and Rajeev ke Sipahi groups is to apprise voters of the work done by the NDA government and previous UPA government respectively, in reality the groups have become generators of content targeting their rivals. When the videos appeared initially, the Congress went about filing police complaints, but now they too seem to have taken the videos in their stride. A video targeting Congress leaders is usually met with another video targeting BJP leaders that the Congress never acknowledges comes from its quarters. “I don’t even look at these videos. I saw the ones that came out initially and found them amusing,” said PCC president Kamal Nath. With the content of these videos based on ridiculing the opponents, gallantry is the last thing on everyone’s mind in this war.

313,Nikhil Wagle,"Every year, political mudslinging transpires with great urgency on June 26 —  to mark the anniversary of the Emergency imposed in 1975. But this time around, it was a notch above normal. The BJP issued advertisements criticising the Emergency and the Congress, Prime Minister  at a rally in Mumbai, finance minister   and compared Indira Gandhi with Hitler, and vice-president Venkaiah Naidu, wrote an opinion piece and proclaimed that   anything of the kind. The reasons behind the overt focus are not mysterious. The 2019 Lok Sabha elections are around the corner. An astute party like the BJP wouldn’t let go a chance to tarnish the Congress’ image. The BJP knows that the tried-and-tested method of attack is the best form of defence. Comparing Indira with Hitler made the Congress respond to it, and the BJP set the narrative. However, who gave the BJP the opportunity to hijack the struggle against Emergency? Along with the Jana Sangh and the RSS, organisations and individuals opposing the Emergency included socialists, the Syndicate Congress, the Marxist communists and so on. Sarvoday activist Prabhakar Sharma had even immolated himself in protest against Indira's Emergency. Thousands of political activists were jailed. Young Turks in the Congress, Chandrashekhar, Mohan Dhariya, Krishna Kant were put behind bars. Senior Congress leaders like Babu Jagjivan Ram and Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna had quit the party before the historic 1977 elections. Then why is the RSS and the BJP seen as the major force behind resisting the Emergency? In fact, during the twilight of the Emergency, the then RSS chief, Balasaheb Deoras, had even written apology letters to Indira. Several RSS workers walked out of jail after issuing apologies. Atal Bihari Vajpayee also agreed to all government terms before walking out on parole, which was disclosed by  . How did the BJP succeed in brushing these facts under the carpet? The guilty conscience of the Congress and every other political party opposing the BJP is responsible for it. During the 60-odd years of being in power, the Congress made several mistakes. Ghosts of the 1984 riots still haunt the grand old party. And its own position on the Emergency, even after all these years, remains ambiguous. the excesses during the Emergency, at a rally in Yavatmal (Maharashtra) in 1978 , but the public perception is that the party has never condemned it unequivocally. In fact, on Sanjay Gandhi’s birth anniversary, the Congress Twitter handle paid tribute to the “visionary” leader. Shashi Tharoor has repeatedly called for an apology from Britain for the colonial exploitation. Why, then, can’t his own party unequivocally condemn the Emergency on June 26? Even   has expressed regrets regarding the excesses of the church in the past. Had the Congress too apologised for the Emergency, it would have rid itself of the guilty conscience. But the leadership needs to have a big heart for that, which they lack. The party is still not ready to accept the Emergency as a black chapter in the history of Independent India. On the contrary, their supporters peddle propaganda of “anarchy” by Indira’s opponents, which “compelled” her to do what she did. The Shah Commission has disputed the theory, and there is enough evidence to show she did it to save her own chair after the Allahabad High Court annulled her election. The anti-incumbency against her had peaked due to corruption and inflation. And Jayaprakash Narayan (JP ) rode the wave brilliantly, asking for her resignation. To get out of it, Indira decided to strangle the fundamental rights of the people. Authoritarian leaders often blame the Opposition for their own wrongdoings. Indira did exactly that. For the past 43 years, the Congress has been propagating that JP asked the police and the Army to disobey Indira’s orders. And rather successfully. However, JP had asked the force to disobey unconstitutional orders. How is it wrong to appeal to the law enforcement agencies to abide by the law of the land? Even Rahul Gandhi can say it if he feels Modi is misusing the police. Just before the Emergency, JP addressed a huge gathering at the Ramlila Maidan, where he famously said, “ Abidcate the throne, here come the people).” In this rally, JP, according to a myth spread by Congress cheerleaders, appealed to the people to capsise the government. But he was no Bal Thackeray or Akbaruddin Owaisi. JP had stressed that Indira had no moral right to stay on as PM, and that she should resign. There was another conspiracy theory spread by Indira supporters. That JP was a ""CIA agent"" and an international plot was being hatched to destabilise Indira. This theory was so hilarious, it did not resonate among the citizenry, and does not deserve more than two lines in this piece either. In fact, there was international pressure on Indira, but to lift the Emergency. JP is also often accused to legitimising the RSS. First of all, it was Ram Manohar Lohia, who tried to bring together all anti-Congress parties in 1967. That was the need of the hour. Just like today, where the only way the BJP stands challenged is if the Opposition parties unite. During the Emergency, Indira jailed her opponents and that proximity lead to a culmination — the Janata Party. Had the Opposition leaders not come together, people would have had to tolerate the excesses of Indira and Sanjay Gandhi for a few more years. The RSS received genuine legitimacy during the Rajiv Gandhi years. In 1984, the BJP managed only two seats in the general elections. The lifeline, however, to gain mileage was the reversal of Shah Bano judgment, which led to the Ram Janmabhoomi agitation. By allowing to conduct Shilanyas, Rajiv Gandhi helped them further. After that, there was no looking back for the BJP. The Congress, therefore, can be blamed for the rise of the BJP. The only way the Congress can claim to fight fascism is to first openly admit its past mistakes. In fact, socialists and Marxist communists should also wear their resistance against the Emergency as a badge of honour. But, staying true to democracy, the BJP has even hijacked their agenda. The steady decline of the two is responsible for it. Low on confidence, they even carry their own achievements as a burden today. This entire situation is worrisome. There is no dearth of common citizens who believe in democracy. Why should we expect only political parties to fight authoritarianism? Not a single party in India has the moral right. Deification of a leader has superseded the ideology of the party. Yesterday it was ""Indira is India""; today, it is ""Har Har Modi"". Mass sterilisations took a huge toll on the poor Muslims, OBCs and Dalits during Indira’s regime. Cow terrorism is persecuting the Muslims during Modi’s. Dalits are being harassed even today. Political opponents have not been picked up and jailed en-mass so far, like it happened during the Indira's Emergency, but selected activists have been charged with being Naxals for standing up to suppression of dissent. The credibility of the judiciary has taken a hit,there are accusations of media being censored and a section of it is already crawling. The middle class has remained consistently indifferent. There is no end to the debate between ""your"" Emergency and ""my"" emergency. The need of the hour is to oppose the draconian idea behind the Emergency, irrespective of whether it is declared or undeclared.",2018-06-29,"Modi,Congress,Emergency,BJP",Why BJP succeeded in hijacking the anti-Emergency struggle,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bjp-emergency-congress-modi-rss-indira-gandhi-jayaprakash-narayan/story/1/25179.html
314,Joyeeta Bhattacharjee,"China-Bangladesh relations have undergone dramatic transformation from a formerly adversarial relationship to an enduring strategic partnership. During the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971, China supported Pakistan. Post-liberation of Bangladesh, China even vetoed that country’s entry into the United Nations. Since then, the bilateral relationship has undergone significant transformation. Today, Bangladesh considers China an all-weather friend and trusted ally. During Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Dhaka in 2016, the two countries established a strategic partnership. China and Bangladesh diplomatic relations were established in January 1976, just a few months after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of Bangladesh’s freedom movement and the country’s first Prime Minister. In August 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed in a military coup. The military dictatorship that succeeded Mujibur Rahman is credited with enhancing Bangladesh’s ties with China. In 1977, military dictator General Ziaur Rahman visited China, the first visit by any Bangladeshi head of state to China. The visit gave major impetus to the relationship and it has grown steadily. There has been a consistency in Bangladesh regarding its policy towards China. In 1991, democracy was restored in Bangladesh and democratic governments have backed the relationship. The democratically elected leaders have been visiting China regularly. The current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited China in June 2014. There are various facets in Sino-Bangladesh relations. The two countries share defence, economic, political and people-to-people ties. Defence ties between the two countries is considered a major strength of the relationship. China is the only country with which Bangladesh signed a defense agreement. China is the biggest arms supplier to Bangladesh. Bangladesh defense forces are equipped with Chinese arms including tanks, missile launchers, fighter aircraft and several weapons systems. Recently, Bangladesh purchased two Ming class submarines from China. Besides, China provides training to officers of the Bangladesh army. Bangladesh’s dependence on Chinese arms has made the army a major supporter of the defence relationship. It is worth noting after liberation, the Bangladesh Army had inducted repatriated officers of Pakistan army who were familiar with Chinese arms. Because of this familiarity with Chinese arms, Bangladesh army preferred sourcing weapons from China. The influence of the Cold War also cannot be ignored. Mujibur Rahman was considered pro-Soviet because of his closeness to India despite India and the Soviet Union supporting Bangladesh in its liberation from Pakistan. China and Bangladesh have reconciled with the past and the relationship has grown in every sector. Economic ties are an important aspect of bilateral relations. China is Bangladesh’s biggest trading partner with bilateral trade worth $10 billion dollars. However, the trade balance favours China with the trade gap between China and Bangladesh worth $9 billion dollars. Bangladesh pressed for concessions to reduce the deficit and China obliged giving duty-free access to Bangladeshi products. However, despite these concessions by China there is no visible change in the deficit. China is also investing in Bangladesh mainly in the area of manufacturing. Development cooperation forms an important part of the bilateral relationship. China is a major development partner of Bangladesh in infrastructure. China is building bridges, roads, railway tracks, airport, and power plants. Chinese developmental assistance mostly comes as lines of credits. During President Jinping’s visit in 2016, China promised to give $24 billion dollars in economic assistance to Bangladesh primarily as lines of credit for twenty four projects. These development partnership initiatives have helped China burnish its image in Bangladesh. Through the development partnership, China is able to portray itself as a friend seeking the wellbeing of the people and progress of the country. This image of China contributed toward its popularity in Bangladesh. China has wisely capitalised its popularity in gaining political advantage by convincing Bangladesh to back its entry into South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation as an observer and convinced Dhaka to join the Belt Road Initiative (BRI). In addition to these initiatives, Beijing is providing scholarships to students to study in China and encouraging Bangladeshis to learn Chinese. A Chinese language centre was established in Bangladesh University of professionals, run by the Bangladesh army, to learn the Chinese language. Furthermore, today, there is flight connectivity between Beijing and Dhaka via Kunming in Yunnan. A crucial reason for the growth of Sino-Bangladesh relations is due to a national consensus in Bangladesh. China has skilfully created a perception in Bangladesh that it is politically neutral and non-interfering by refraining from commenting about Bangladesh’s internal issues in public. Bangladesh claims that economic considerations are the crux of this relationship. For Bangladesh, Chinese investments are lucrative, as it needs them for developing of its infrastructure. Bangladesh is aiming to become a developed nation by 2040 and to achieve that target the country needs to develop its infrastructure and boost economic productivity. China has been generous in providing financial support for Dhaka’s development projects. China’s main interest is in Bangladesh’s 160 million strong market. Besides, Bangladesh is a good outsourcing destination for its manufacturing industries because of the cheap labour Bangladesh offers. Again, ports in Bangladesh are an important motivation for China because it offers a lucrative alternative route to reduce its dependence on the Straits of Malacca for the supply of its energy. Given Bangladesh’s geographical proximity to China’s Yunnan Province, its ports can be easily accessed for the supply of energy resources. Nevertheless, there is an India factor for the bonhomie between China and Bangladesh. There is a large section in Bangladesh supporting stronger ties with China to counterbalance India. For China, developing a relationship gives it a presence in a major country in South Asia, which is India’s backyard. Bangladesh could work as a bridge to access the Indian markets for its products. Again, Bangladesh’ strategic location, especially, close proximity to Siliguri Corridor, a narrow strip of land connecting India’s northeast region to the rest of the country, is also a motivating factor. Indian security analysts suggest that China might leverage its relationship with Bangladesh to watch India closely in the event major hostilities breakout between China and India over their disputed border. Although analysts in Bangladesh observed such assumptions are far-fetched, the country, instead wants to maintain good relations with both India and China. Recently, Prime Minister of Bangladesh said that India should not be worried about the country’s relationship with China. While China-Bangladesh relationship is generally warm, there is evidence suggesting Bangladesh might not be subservient to the Chinese diktats. Bangladesh not agreeing to the Chinese conditions on the construction of the Sonadia deep-sea port in 2014 can be taken as an example.

315,Sanjaya Baru,"Rumour has it that Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency rule in June 1975 after being told by Cuban supremo Fidel Castro that she was the next target of a  , following the killing of Chile’s Salvador Allende.  Convinced that her own life was in danger and that the aim was to destabilise India, it is argued, Mrs Gandhi declared a   that placed all political opposition behind bars and clamped dictatorial rule, including constraints on Constitutional freedoms.  It is also rumoured that among the many factors that contributed to Mrs Gandhi’s decision to lift Emergency rule was advice to that effect from the newly elected President of the United States, Jimmy Carter. In short, Castro’s advice encouraged Mrs Gandhi to impose Emergency — Carter’s advice encouraged her to lift it. Surely, there would have been many, many other factors at play, but there is no doubt that it was a highly personalised decision that had few takers, even within her inner circle of aides and advisors. This is best captured by one of her closest and longstanding aides, her information advisor HY Sharada Prasad’s curious observation that the Emergency was ""Indira Gandhi’s coup against her own prime ministership"". That Castro and Carter played a role in her personal decision draws attention to an interesting dimension of the Emergency — its location in the Cold War era. There is no denying that Mrs Gandhi took India into the so-called ""Soviet Camp"", of the Cold War era, with the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation that her foreign minister and the Soviet foreign minister signed in 1971. By the late 1960s, and certainly after 1971, Indian foreign policy moved away from the traditional Nehruvian non-alignment stance to a more explicit pro-Soviet stance. The Emergency, in a sense, was the apogee of that shift. It was no coincidence that many ""pro-US"" political leaders were arrested during the Emergency — but the very pro-Soviet Communist Party of India (CPI) was spared. In short, apart from all the domestic political factors that would have contributed to the imposition of the Emergency, the Cold War was clearly an important external factor. Again, it may not be a coincidence that after the   was formed under the leadership of Morarji Desai, the-then US president promptly visited India, in January 1978, being the last US president to visit India in his first term until the visit of president Barack Obama in 2010.  The Janata government’s external affairs minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee spoke of India now pursuing “genuine non-alignment” — as opposed to Indira Gandhi’s ""leftward non-alignment"". Something interesting happened when Mrs Gandhi was in the Opposition, in 1977-1980, and before she returned to power in 1980. She made critical references to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in private and let it be known in Moscow that she disapproved of the invasion. Back in office in 1980, she told visiting Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, ""India is against all categories of interference which have affected the sovereignty, progress, prosperity, and nonalignment of the people of Afghanistan."" Mrs Gandhi clearly realised that India should in fact stay away from Cold War alliances and return to the pursuit of India’s own national interest. In recognition of this switch, US President Ronald Reagan greeted her in Washington DC with the  :  “In searching for words to describe the focus of your visit to Washington this week, I came upon a statement that you had made in Delhi when Roy Jenkins visited in 1980. And at that time, you said, ""The great need in the world today is to so define national interest that it makes for greater harmony, greater equality and justice, and greater stability in the world."" Well, that is more than an eloquent description of enlightened national interest. It can also serve to describe the foundation of the relationship between the United States and India, a relationship we seek to reaffirm this week. A strengthening of that relationship, based on better understanding, is particularly important at this time.” If indeed one important personal motivation for the imposition of the Emergency by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was her own personal fear for her life — that she could become one more Third World victim of the Cold War — then this fear, along with genuine misgivings about the Soviet action in Afghanistan, may have helped restore balance to Indian foreign policy. Scholars have suggested various dividing lines between ""Nehruvian"" and ""Post-Nehruvian"" foreign policy. The Emergency period could well have been the turning point.",2018-06-27,"US,Janata party government,Indira Gandhi,Emergency",The Emergency - Turning point for Nehruvian 'non-aligned' India,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/emergency-indira-gandhi-assassination-jimmy-carter-soviet-us-janata-party-government-us-sanjaya-baru/story/1/25138.html
316,Deeksha Goel,"While visits by heads of states and governments are not new to the diplomatic corridors of Delhi, the visit of  has grabbed a lot of eyeballs. The reason being the hanging fate of India’s joint military base at the Assumption Island. While the discussions do not seem to have materialised as far as the Assumption Island is concerned, the larger ambit of India-Seychelles ties has only grown in stature. Prime Minister Narendra Modi as part of his Indian Ocean sojourn visited the island nation of Seychelles in March 2015. As an outcome of the delegation-level talks led by PM Modi and the then president of Seychelles, James Michel, both governments reached an agreement to enhance infrastructural facilities at the Assumption Island. A coastal surveillance radar system was installed by the Indian government in 2016.   The agreement was then revised and ratified by both India and Seychelles in January 2018. However, it was then declared dead by the opposition parties of Seychelles. Unlike India, the opposition forms a majority in Seychelles and thus the deal did not meet its fate. Assumption Island is located in the outer group of the 115 islands that make up the boundary of Seychelles, lying north of Madagascar. A joint military build-up would have been in the region’s larger geo-strategic interest and in countering the growing menace of piracy off the Mozambique coast, which is also the most important channel for trade destined for and from the Indian Ocean. However, disappointments did not plague the visit and enough warmth could be seen among the two premiers.   Following the review of the wide-ranging cooperation between the countries on issues of defence and strategic partnership, PM Modi announced a $100 million line of credit for the government of Seychelles. This credit being extended by the Indian establishment could be used by the Seychelles government to enhance its military and naval capacity by using it for the purchase of defence equipment from India. A   was also handed over by PM Modi to the visiting president. The Dornier aircraft is a second-of-its-kind machine to be gifted by the Indian establishment to help Seychelles in monitoring its 1.3 million sq km of Exclusive Economic Zone. The machine is a state-of-the-art aircraft which has the ability to detect any movements on the surface of the sea with enough capacity to apprise the operators of the size of the fleet moving on the surface. In some cases, the aircraft has also been able to decipher ship-to-ship transmissions. 
 
 Addressing the  earlier this month in Singapore PM Modi had reiterated his commitment to build economic and military capabilities of India’s friends and partners to ensure the collective security of the region. The military and naval assistance being rendered to Seychelles is in furtherance to the Indian government’s efforts to ensure free, open and inclusive Indian Ocean Region which has been recapitulated in its policy of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR). By engaging all stakeholders and littoral nations of the region, the Indian government is trying to promote safe and inclusive growth across the waters of the ocean. At the same time, the government is also cautious of China’s presence at  . China is alleged to have been building a ""string of pearls"" around the Indian peninsula to beat the  in case of India’s growing leadership and influence in the region. Much like the ambit of this bilateral relationship, the assistance extended by the Indian government to strengthen Seychelles’ defence capabilities too was wide-ranging. Capacity building was not restricted to technical and infrastructure fronts only, but also included an agreement on the technical training of both civilian and defence personnel of Seychelles to increase its human development capacity. Indian specialists will also be sent on deputation to render their assistance and expertise in the successful implementation of Seychelles’ National Development Projects.    Historian, diplomat and professor  had said: ""The future of India will undoubtedly be decided on the sea. It is indissolubly connected with developments in the Indian Ocean."" The present scenario building up around the shores of the ocean is proving his words to be true. The future of the entire region is being decided by the ripples of the ocean and the Indian government is leaving no stone unturned in ensuring that the tides are nothing but favourable.      ",2018-06-27,"Modi,China,Indian Ocean,India-seychelles ties",On India-Seychelles ties and an 'island of assumption' over a naval base project,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-seychelles-ties-indian-ocean-modi-china-pakistan-assumption-island-project-hambantota-gwadar-sagar/story/1/25143.html
317,Ashok Swain,"On June 12, 2018, Governor's rule was imposed once again in Jammu and Kashmir after the collapse of the PDP-BJP coalition government. Governor's rule is not uncommon in J&K. Even present governor NN Vohra has had to run the state twice in the past. What is unprecedented are the popular protests going on since 2015 due to the disillusionment of the Valley's youth with the unexpected post-election alliance between the PDP with the BJP. Popular protests in the Valley have become more widespread and violent particularly after the killing of young and charismatic Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in the summer of 2016. With this round of Governor's rule, security operations might get more coordinated and intense, but that is less likely to bring back normalcy to the Valley. No sincere negotiation process with the separatist forces of the state is underway. At the same time India's relationship with Pakistan has reached one of its lowest points. Moreover, BJP's aggressive attempt at mobilising the Hindus in Jammu has divided the state like never before. Overall, due to Modi government's failed policies, India seems to have completely lost its plot in Kashmir. Kashmir has remained India's headache since 1947. The trouble in the Valley is not new. Since 1947, there have been political unrests at regular intervals. However, despite a number of serious political and security miscalculations, the previous governments in Delhi had managed to keep the Kashmir issue a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan. There have been attempts by various world powers in the past to mediate in the conflict. Pakistan has always been lobbying for outside powers to get involved in the issue to dilute India's strategic domination. The smart use of the Tibet card by Delhi had also forced Pakistan's ""iron brother"" China to stay out of India-Pakistan rivalry over Kashmir. But India's seven decades of successful effort to keep Kashmir out of global power politics seems to have collapsed in recent months. The Kashmir issue is fast getting internationalised. And only the strategic and diplomatic blunders of the Narendra Modi government are responsible for it. Just five days before the promulgation of Governor's rule in Kashmir on June 14, 2018, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released its first-ever report on Kashmir. Though the report highlights human rights abuse by both India and Pakistan, it has been particularly harsh against India by criticising its security forces for inflicting mass-civilian killings and atrocities to control rising popular protests. Accusing Pakistan of suppressing peaceful dissent in its controlled territory, the report claims that the Indian security forces on the other hand, have killed 145 civilians from July 2016 to March 2018. The report also highlights the use of pellet-firing shotguns and human shields by Indian forces. Not only OHCHR chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein has released the report, he is also asking Human Right Council to form a   ""to conduct a comprehensive independent international investigation into allegations of human rights violations in Kashmir"". It might not be possible for the OHCHR to initiate an inquiry but the recommendation itself puts India in the category of international outcastes like Burundi, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria. The OHCHR report is a serious setback to India's strategy of keeping Kashmir as a bilateral issue. The report has strongly challenged India's long-held position and if the OHCHR manages to form a commission of inquiry, Kashmir will formally graduate to be an international issue. As expected from Modi government, India came out all guns blazing and   against India, and described the eeport as ""fallacious, tendentious and motivated"". But this reaction is in no way going to stop Pakistan from reiterating its demand for an international probe into human rights violations in Kashmir. The OHCHR report has emboldened Pakistan and revived the hope of Kashmiri activists and diaspora to pursue their campaign with greater vigour. Instead of rhetorically lashing out at the report, India could have pointed at its methodological deficiencies as it draws its findings from ""remote monitoring"" and at the same time would have given a response befitting a respected member of international community by expressing its willingness to look into allegations made in the report. But, Modi government's foreign policy is more focused on spectacles than on substance. On the same day, the Governor's rule was imposed in Kashmir, the Chinese ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui openly   between China, India and Pakistan under the aegis of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation to solve bilateral issues between India and Pakistan, including Kashmir. Since the Doklam standoff, China has dropped its hesitance in openly interfering in Kashmir. At the height of Doklam crisis, even China had threatened India with the   to support Pakistan. Though, the Donald Trump administration has been quite vague over its reaction to the Chinese envoy's recent offer to be a party to the Kashmir issue, it has already expressed its readiness to   in April 2017. Considering the unpredictability of the Trump administration, it will be foolhardy to remain confident about US supporting India's position on Kashmir. The Modi government should read the warning from the   of the CIA under the Trump administration, which describes Hindu right groups such as Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad as  . While US' position has become very unpredictable, Pakistan, with overt support from China and covert support from Russia, is much stronger diplomatically vis-à-vis the Kashmir issue. In this context, unless the Modi government starts a comprehensive peace process with Pakistan to bring normalcy to the Valley and stops its partisan politics of mobilisation of Hindus in Jammu, it will not be possible for India to arrest the rapid drift of the Kashmir issue to the international stage.",2018-06-27,"Narendra Modi,Zeid ra'ad al-hussein,Un report on kashmir,Kashmir crisis",How Modi government is ensuring Kashmir becomes an international issue,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kashmir-crisis-un-report-on-kashmir-zeid-raad-al-hussein-china-pakistan-relations-doklam-standoff/story/1/25135.html
318,Minhaz Merchant,"The full force of the Emergency, declared by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on June 25/26, 1975, struck me one day at dawn. Two CID men in safari suits rang our doorbell. Ushered in, after showing their official identification cards, they told my bemused parents that they had come to interrogate me. I was still a student but had begun writing articles for  and other newspapers, including the New York-based  . One particular piece might have drawn the ire of the  . Woken up and bleary-eyed, I explained to the two CID officers in plain clothes that they were wasting their time. They told me they had received a tip-off about my articles and asked me to be careful what I would write in future. “People are being jailed for writing against the Emergency,” they warned me before leaving. Over 1,00,000 people were in fact jailed. Among them were Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Jayaprakash Narayan, LK Advani and a young Arun Jaitley. Also jailed were those whose names will strike a bell in today’s Opposition — HD Deve Gowda, Lalu Prasad Yadav and MK Stalin. The Emergency is justified today in certain quarters as being the natural outcome of the political turbulence of mid-1970s. Many students deliberating on careers at the time were drawn to journalism, social and public sectors so that they could fight the anti-democratic forces that had unleashed the draconian Emergency. It was a defining moment in India’s short history, just 28 years after Independence.  was launched months after the Emergency was proclaimed. For those who see a semblance of the Emergency in today’s polarised times, a reality check is necessary. During the Emergency, the Constitution was suspended, the Supreme Court superseded and personal liberties based on the principle of  subverted. To provide a sense of how draconian the Emergency was,  wrote this in August  2017: “Over 40 years after the Supreme Court’s darkest hour when it said citizens have no right to life and liberty during the Emergency period, a nine-judge Bench condemned the decision in the infamous ADM Jabalpur case, better known as the   case, as ‘seriously flawed’. Of the five judges on that Bench, only Justice H R Khanna had dissented with the majority opinion of then Chief Justice of India AN Ray and Justices MH Beg, YV Chandrachud and PN Bhagwati. Justice Khanna’s dissent cost him the chief justiceship. He was superseded by Justice Beg, following which Justice Khanna resigned. Now, for the first time in the Supreme Court’s history, a nine-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar, officially condemned the Supreme Court’s majority opinion in the   case. The judgment authored by Justice DY Chandrachud, who incidentally is the son of Justice YV Chandrachud, ‘expressly overruled’ the 1976 majority judgment and removed a long-pending taint on the Court’s history as a people’s champion.” Those who compare the intolerance of today with the Emergency are either ignorant or biased. Journalists and activists mock Prime Minister Narendra Modi daily. Websites are full of stories on cow vigilantism, Dalit lynchings and other crimes, attributing them to the policies of the Modi government. And that is as it should be: it is how free media in a democracy functions. Freedom of speech, crushed under the Emergency, has never been stronger. The Modi government has been slow to condemn many incidents of egregious violence against Dalits, Muslims and others. Some are fake news. Some are not. In most cases though, they are met with silence from the government. It is left to a BJP MP or MLA to provide a loose canon justification. But none of this portends a draconian state, simply a clueless state. Obviously, in 2018 we must set the bar high. Till 1975-77, the two Emergency years, there had never been a non-Congress government. In the 30 years between 1947 and 1977, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi had been prime ministers for a collective 28 years. India knew no worthwhile Opposition. The government in the only Communist-ruled state, Kerala, had been dismissed in 1959 and President’s rule was imposed. (Mrs Gandhi was Congress president then – Nehru had sown the seed of dynastic politics.) What lessons can the Modi government learn from the Emergency that tore Indian democracy into shreds 43 years ago this day? First, while our democratic institutions and civil society are too strong today to let it happen again, they must be further strengthened, not weakened. A high bar demands that governance must be more transparent. The   and CICs has long been kept in abeyance. That damages the government’s credibility, casts aspersions on its intent, and undermines the institutions of democracy. Second, the judiciary must be less opaque. It is today   with the government over the memorandum of procedure (MoP). When trust between two key pillars of a democracy – the Executive and the Judiciary – erodes, democracy is weakened. Third, inclusive governance must be a priority. Polarisation for votes has long been a Congress project. It collared the minority vote bank in the 1980s before regional parties got into the act and usurped a part of that vote bank. The BJP has learnt from the Congress. LK Advani’s rath yatras from 1990 onwards (many of which a young Narendra Modi organised) polarised Hindu votes, allowing the BJP to form the first full-term non-Congress government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1999 (the 1998-99 BJP-led government was shortlived).  As India becomes more prosperous, as poverty levels fall, religious polarisation will offer diminishing returns. Millennials have a different set of aspirations from their parents. They want jobs. They are religious but not dogmatic. The BJP must reinvent itself or it will soon be seen as a party of grumpy old men, full of grievances and self-pity. The RSS, too, must reform. Glorifying India’s past is fine. But we live in the present and must mould the future. Hold symposia on Indic culture by all means. But also hold symposia on space research, electric vehicles, artificial intelligence and the exciting new discoveries in life sciences that could dramatically alter human lives in the next two decades. The Emergency of 1975-77 happened because democracy was hijacked by the dynastic arrogance of Indira Gandhi. Sycophants like Dev Kant Barooah, who was the party president at that time, declared “India is Indira, Indira is India”. Modi must avoid such flattery from within his ranks. He is a self-declared  . His second term, if he gets it, will decide the course India takes for the next decade. The 43rd anniversary of the Emergency should not be an opportunity to just score political points over the Congress, but reflect on how the BJP government can return to first principles: less government, more governance.",2018-06-25,"BJP,Congress,Indira Gandhi,Emergency",Here's why Emergency won't ever happen again,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/1975-emergency-indira-gandhi-june-25-black-day-of-democracy-freedom-of-speech-narendra-modi-bjp/story/1/25098.html
319,Yashee,"Senior BJP leader Lal Singh of Jammu recently issued a warning in public interest. Journalists, , should “draw a line”, or “be prepared to meet the fate” of Shujaat Bukhari, the editor of newspaper  , who was gunned down in Srinagar on June 14.    
 
 On June 25,    BJP Jammu and Kashmir president Ravindra Raina as saying that no action would be taken against Singh for his statements. No other leader from the party has so far condemned Singh. The J&K BJP, thus, seems officially okay with one of its leaders threatening journalists on a public forum. However, Singh’s statements are not just improper, they are arguably illegal. If his party is failing in its duty, why is the state machinery silent? Jammu and Kashmir is under Governor’s rule, which is in effect the Centre’s government. Why have the prime minister or home minister not reprimanded him? Incidentally, the J&K police have said that Bukhari was killed by terrorists acting on instructions from Pakistan, because he was trying to promote peace in the Valley. So does Lal Singh want journalists to toe Pakistan’s line and not work towards soothing conflict in Kashmir? Or does he have some other information about the murder? In the latter case, the BJP leader should share it with the police, or they should interrogate him, as the Kashmir Editors Guild has rightly . Singh has accused Kashmiri journalists of “creating an erroneous atmosphere”. “Kashmiri journalists have created an erroneous atmosphere and I would like to ask them to draw a line…You want to live like what happened to Basharat (Shujaat Bukhari)…Take care of yourselves and draw a line so that the brotherhood is not broken and it is maintained so that progress and development is ensured,” he said on June 22. This, in unambiguous terms, is a threat.   defines criminal intimidation as threatening a person with harm to make them do something, “or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do”.   Reporting and writing about the happenings around them is a journalist’s job. The Constitution guarantees them the freedom of speech and expression. Singh has a personal grouse against mediapersons – he has been  , after he was forced to resign as the state forests minister over his role in defending the Kathua gangrape and murder accused. His recent statement, if not outright illegal, is in every way condemnable. Yet, on the day the BJP was issuing statements over the dark, dark days of the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, not one word was heard from them on the attack on press freedom by one of their own partymen.    Why this reticence, by a party full of eloquent leaders, and which cares about the freedom of the media, as evident from BJP president Amit Shah’s tweets on the Emergency? 
 
 In fact, only on June 23, Shah in Jammu had  from Congress president Rahul Gandhi over statements on Kashmir made by party leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Saifuddin Soz, and asked that Gandhi act against the two.   The BJP, thus, cares about the press. It also understands the concept of collective responsibility, and believes that the head of the party is responsible for what its members say and do. In this light, the party’s – and the government’s – silence over Singh becomes truly alarming. This is not the first time that Singh’s conduct has been less than ideal. He was among the leading voices in support of the Kathua rape accused and demanding a CBI probe into the case. During his tenure as the forests minister, he had promised to “retrieve forest land”, which the Muslim Gujjar Bakarwal tribes was a ploy to evict them. In 2016, he had  , reminding them of the killings of Muslims in Jammu after Partition. More recently, his brother was arrested for calling  . The BJP cannot possibly be blind to all this. It is not acting against Singh because it does not want to. Is this the BJP’s version of a muscular, 56-inch chested party? Where bullying and threatening opponents is fair game, and decency in public discourse is unnecessary, easily dispensable? Having called off its alliance with the PDP in J&K, the BJP is now likely to go to town with its “tough” line against separatists and militants, using it as a convenient cover for communal polarisation and minority bashing ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.     In the process, it is normalising hate, making violence a part of everyday discourse. However, the bigger worry is how top leaders seem to be conflating the party with the government. The BJP is one political party, guided by ideology, driven by electoral concerns. The government is of the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the head of the government, and upholding law and order throughout the country is, at the end of the day, his responsibility. During the Gujarat riots of 2002, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had asked Modi, then the CM of the state, to observe his “ ” (duty of governance) without discriminating between people on the basis of caste, creed or religion. Someone needs to give that message to the prime minister again. Sadly, no one in his party seems willing, or capable, of doing the job.         ",2018-06-25,"Jammu and Kashmir,BJP,Chaudhary Lal Singh,Freedom of Press",Why hasn't BJP condemned Lal Singh for warning journalists of 'Shujaat-like incident'?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bjp-leader-threatens-journalists-chaudhary-lal-singh-jammu-shujaat-bukhari-kathua-gangrape-and-murder-amit-shah-narendra-modi/story/1/25106.html
320,Saif Ullah Khan,"Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has raised the demand for reservation of seats for Dalits in minority-run institutions, such as Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI). Speaking  in Chipramau, Kannauj, on June 24, Yogi said, “  (One question should be raised to all those who are saying that Dalits are being humiliated… when would they ask for reservation for our Dalit brothers in Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia)... if an institution like Banaras Hindu University can give Dalit quota, why can't minority-run institutions like Aligarh Muslim University?"" The UP CM went on to target Congress president Rahul Gandhi, saying he remembers temples only during elections. Adityanath also accused Gandhi and his party of “demoralising the Indian Army”. Raising the issue of the minority status of AMU and JMI and clubbing it with Dalit reservation seems to be a clever ploy by Adityanath to counter recent political reversals. The coming together of OBC, Dalits and Muslim votes, with the SP, the BSP and the RLD joining hands, has   in Uttar Pradesh. While earlier the party lost the prestigious Phulpur and Gorakhpur seats to the SP, the united opposition also won the recently concluded Kairana and Noorpur by-polls. Creating a rift in the opposition unity, thus, is imperative for the BJP. Any attempt by the opposition parties to rally behind these institutions will also help the saffron party in labelling them “anti-Dalit”.  While the minority status of AMU has been debated since the   using them to create a rift between communities, especially in the run-up to elections, is a recent trend.   Even earlier, during the campaign for the May 28 by-polls to Kairana and Noorpur, a  when members of Hindu Yuva Vahini-ABVP led a violent protest in AMU over the presence of Mohammad Ali Jinnah's portrait. Instead of condemning the violence on campus, Adityanath (who incidentally is also the founder of Hindu Yuva Vahini) jumped into the fray, and promised an inquiry over the presence of the portrait. What was glossed over was the fact that the portrait had been in AMU since 1938, as the AMU Students’ Union had conferred the rare honour of a lifetime membership on Jinnah. The underlying message behind the row was clear — since Jinnah divided the country, he does not deserve to be honoured, and those who do so are anti-nationals. Instead of addressing the demands of non-payment of dues to sugarcane farmers, the UP CM was more than happy to rake up this 80-year-old issue. However, having found no takers for the Jinnah controversy, and losing out to the Opposition alliance on both the seats, Adityanath now seems to have come up with another strategy to counter the Opposition.  The combination of OBC, Dalits and Muslims votes in UP has created a formidable voter bloc that is threatening the BJP’s chances for 2019.  The only way to counter this is a repeat of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, where the BJP got   riding on the Modi wave and the subsequent consolidation of Hindu votes. This combination was so potent that regional parties like the BSP, with a core voter base of Dalits, scored zero.  As a result, the BJP was able to sweep Uttar Pradesh, where the party won 73(71+2 seats of alliance partner) out of 80 seats. This took BJP’s overall individual tally in the Lok Sabha to 282. Singling out minority institutions and labelling them as those that don’t provide reservation to Dalits serves two purposes for Adityanath. On one hand, the UP CM would hope to please his right-wing support base that believes that all that the previous governments have done is minority appeasement, with Muslims the biggest beneficiaries of the state's largesse. On the other, it goes with the BJP strategy of poaching Dalit votes from Mayawati's BSP. With rising incidents of crime against Dalits already alienating the community from the ruling party, the BJP hopes to use this issue to create a rift in the “secular” Opposition. The game-plan to pit Dalits against the minorities is part of the saffron strategy to counter the coming together of Opposition parties in the name of secularism.  The BJP hopes to counter this “secularism” by labelling it as antagonistic to Hindus. The party would also hope to use this as an antidote to Mandal politics, something that has been the reason for its defeat in states like Bihar, since this secular bloc includes parties like the SP, the BSP and the RJD, with dedicated caste-based voters.   This is not the first time that the UP CM has taken on the “secular” forces. In a speech made on November 14, 2017,  , “I believe that the word secular is the biggest lie since Independence. Those that have given birth to this lie and those that use it should apologise to the people and this country. No system can be secular. Political system can be sect-neutral.”            The coming together of the Opposition parties under the umbrella of secularism is the biggest thorn in the BJP’s side. The party believes it will not be able to repeat its 2014 Lok Sabha performance in the wake of this consolidation. The only way out for the party is to go in for an aggressive Dalit outreach. At a recent high-level meeting of the party, it was decided that senior party leaders would visit Dalit homes to counter this growing alienation within the community. The raking up of the minority status of AMU and JMI is another opportunity for the ruling party to reach out to the Dalit community and undo some of the harm that incidents like  ,   and violence by cow vigilantes have done. The last thing that the party needs is for this Opposition alliance to be replicated in other states.   The party also plans to make inroads in states like West Bengal, where it has emerged as the principal opposition party. The BJP has already been peddling the narrative that chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s administration indulges in minority appeasement, something that goes well with its right-wing narrative. The recent decision of the BJP to  in Jammu and Kashmir has also given the party a free hand to go about minority bashing, especially with the Lok Sabha polls less than a year away. Already, there have been statements from the BJP quarters about how the Mehbooba Mufti government neglected the people of Jammu and Ladakh to pander to her own vote bank. This will also be peddled aggressively in the run-up to the General Elections, to undo the damage that the party feels has been caused by its alliance with a party its supporters view as pro-separatist. These are not just random statements of a sitting chief minister. There is a method to the madness. The ruling party knows that if it has any chance to win the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, it will have to divide the opposition parties that have come together to defeat it. And what better way to do that than to indulge in minority bashing, create chinks in opposition unity, add a dash of Pakistan, and claim that the Opposition does not care for the Army.    ",2018-06-25,"Opposition unity,Yogi Aditayanth,Dalits,AMU",Jinnah portrait ruckus to demand for Dalit quota in AMU and Jamia: Adityanath has a new strategy,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/yogi-adityanath-aligarh-muslim-university-jamia-millia-islamia-dalit-reservation-bjp-uttar-pradesh-opposition-unity/story/1/25108.html
321,Kiran Tare,"A fortnight after BJP president Amit Shah called him on at his residence in Mumbai, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray seems to be reluctant to bridge the gap between the two parties. Reiterating his stand that the Shiv Sena will go alone in the next election, Thackeray announced Shrinivas Vanga as the party’s candidate in the Palghar Lok Sabha constituency. Interestingly, Vanga had lost the by-election on May 31 to BJP’s Rajendra Gavit. On the Shiv Sena’s 52nd foundation day on June 19, Thackeray assigned a task to the party workers to go door to door and check whether several schemes being run by the Union as well as the state government have really reached to their beneficiaries. “They [BJP] are running a campaign ‘Sampark for Samarthan’. You run a ‘Satyashodhan Abhiyan’ (fact finding campaign) to verify whether their claims on development are correct,” Thackeray said. Thackeray also pointed towards a whispering campaign that suggests that the Lok Sabha elections will be held in December this year, and not in April-May next year. He appealed the party workers to brace for the election. “Next chief minister will be from the Shiv Sena.” He announced that his party will oppose Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet project bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad as well as the Mumbai-Vadodara express highway as both the project will benefit Gujarat more than Maharashtra. No one goes from Mumbai to Ahmedabad for work but a lot of people will come to Mumbai through this route. The BJP has conspired to turn Mumbai into a suburb of Gujarat,” Thackeray alleged. An insider from Shiv Sena told me that Thackeray might get into an agreement with BJP in Lok Sabha elections but he will definitely go solo in state Assembly elections due in September 2019. “Most of the MPs want an alliance with BJP for Lok Sabha polls so that they can survive against the united opposition,” he said. He argues that BJP will benefit in a multi corner fight as it happened in Palghar where BJP registered a narrow victory against candidates of Shiv Sena, Bahujan Vikas Aghadi and Congress. “If we keep the alliance intact we could easily repeat the feat of 2014 in the state.” Republican Party of India president and Union minister of state for social justice Ramdas Athawale claims that the Shiv Sena cannot have its chief minister if it goes alone. Political observers point that the Shiv Sena is weak in two major regions of the state, Vidarbha and western Maharashtra which contribute 130 out of 288 Assembly seats. It had won 30 seats in the region of Mumbai, Thane and Konkan. Even if it repeats its performance in this belt and add some seats in Marathwada and north Maharashtra but fails to shine in Vidarbha and western Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena could not reach beyond 70 seats. In this case, the Shiv Sena will have to play second fiddle to whichever the single-largest party, in case it wants to join the government.

322,Praveen Shekhar,"The people of Delhi finally heaved a sigh of relief as chief minister  on June 20. The government machinery had come to a standstill following the sit-in protest at Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s office for nine days by Kejriwal and three of his cabinet ministers. Kejriwal, along with deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, public works department minister Satyendar Jain and development minister Gopal Rai, camped out at Raj Niwas, saying they would not leave the L-G's office until their demands were met. Their demands included a direction to IAS officers working in the Delhi administration to end their “strike”, action against officers who have struck work for “four months” and approval to AAP government’s proposal for doorstep delivery of ration to the poor. To add to the stand-off, the BJP too went on a strike while the Congress was busy with demonstrations against Kejriwal’s dharna. India has rarely seen a situation in which both a government and its Opposition go on protest just to oppose each other. Kejriwal is still maintining that the IAS officers were protesting at the behest of the L-G on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Attacking the L-G, Arvind Kejwial said, “With one phone call from the L-G, the officers attended the meetings.” But the truth is that when the IAS Association had held a press briefing and kept their demands, the only option before Arvind Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party was to somehow break this deadlock. Kejriwal assured Delhi bureaucrats that he will ensure the “safety and security” and dignity of all officers, to which the IAS Association had responded positively. Now, the question that comes to everyone’s mind is — why did Arvind Kejriwal sit on a dharna and his colleagues go on fast? Had Kejriwal wanted, he could have ended the deadlock and found a way much before. The onus to end the stalemate by holding talks with IAS officers was obviously on the CM of the state. Had he done so, he could have bridged the trust deficit between the IAS officers and the government. But one should not forget that Kejriwal is an astute politician. Time and again he has shown his ability to accurately assess situations and turn them into his advantage. With his strike, Kejriwal tried to hit many targets with one stone. He deftly garnered people’s sympathy, reaped support of other political parties and more importantly to galvanised a nationwide ""movement"" for AAP politics. To gain people’s sympathy, Kejriwal alleged that the prime minister is creating hindrance in Delhi government’s administrative work, that IAS officers have been on strike on PM’s direction through the L-G, and that he and his colleagues were protesting on behalf of the people of Delhi. Although this was far from the truth, he was reiterating it again and again. For many days, Delhi and Kejriwal became the subject of public discourse and in media. The impact of the darna was such that he succeeded in getting the support of chief ministers of four states —  West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu, Karnataka CM HD Kumaraswamy and Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan. Many political parties spoke in favour of Kejriwal. But had he resolved the issue without creating much fuss, this situation would not have arisen. Without doubt, Kejriwal and his partymen would be a happier lot now that their hidden agenda has been fulfilled. Also, discussions over failure of the AAP government in Delhi have taken a backseat for sometime. However, those who expected clean politics from Kejriwal and considered him a man of high ideals have been let down once again.  ",2018-06-22,"Delhi,BJP government,Aap-l-g tussle,Arvind Kejriwal",Why Delhi feels let down by Arvind Kejriwal,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/arvind-kejriwal-aap-lg-tussle-bjp-government-delhi-sit-in-protest-ias-officers-on-strike/story/1/25048.html
323,Karan Dhar,"For more than quarter of a century, the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been on edge. This year, the situation is no different. While the BJP’s sudden withdrawal from the coalition government may have taken many by surprise, the writing of its demise had long been etched on the wall. It would be fair to say that security forces, the J&K police in particular, has lost considerable ground to militants in the last two years. The state of affairs is so dire that instead of protecting civilians, the job of the police personnel has been relegated to holding on to their weapons and keeping themselves alive. Incidents of rifle snatching have gone up in recent months and scores of men in uniform have paid the price of trying to foil such attempts. Although Governor’s Rule may give our security forces a proverbial ""free hand"" in flushing out terrorists, the ensuing political vacuum, along with a non-existent policy, may pull the state back to square one. Before BJP supporters celebrate the party’s decision to pull out of an alliance with the PDP in J&K, it must be put on record that the party’s general secretary Ram Madhav, who, on June 19, blamed rising radicalisation and terrorism in Kashmir as one of the reasons for ending the alliance, had only last year claimed  in the Valley. The answer to snapping ties with an ideologically opposite alliance partner may lie in the growing disenchantment of its core voter base in Jammu. Besides, playing hardball in Kashmir is likely to further strengthen our Prime Minister’s rumoured 56-inch chest and boost his prospects in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The undoing of the BJP-PDP alliance, also dubbed as 'north and south pole' for their divergent views on key issues, is likely to cast a shadow on the political future of the Valley. While the BJP still has some time left to woo its core voter base in Jammu, it is the PDP which may find it difficult to impress its core constituency in South Kashmir. Despite its healing touch policy – under which it quashed FIRs against stone pelters and talked the Centre into announcing a Ramzan ceasefire – the party may be skewered for just tying up with the BJP. Moreover, Governor’s Rule, in all likelihood, would be extended for an indefinite period. If the state machinery was not able to hold by-elections in Anantnag for over two years, then no administration in its present state would dare to go for polls, at least for the next one year. With Mehbooba Mufti gone, Pakistan has lost a friendly ear in the government of Kashmir. Rawalpindi will make every effort to pulverise the Line of Control (LoC) in the Jammu region. A long-term solution to the problems of border residents has to be found. Sporadic shelling along the LoC has displaced over 1 lakh people in the last couple of months. Not to mention, scores of jawans who are killed day in and day out in unprovoked firing from across the border. Clearly, a 'surgical strike' hasn’t helped much in this regard. Even as the majority of us were a little taken aback by this alliance break-up, recent inputs by security agencies warning of a major terror strike during the upcoming Amarnath Yatra gave some inkling of an imminent decisive move by the Centre. Last year,  after a bus bearing a Gujarat registration number was ambushed by terrorists near Anantnag. The smooth conduct of the annual pilgrimage would feature at the top of the central government’s to-do list in Kashmir now. Though the opening of a 4-lane highway may help security forces in steering pilgrims away from South Kashmir’s congested towns which have become a hotbed of radicalism, providing security cover to each and every vehicle will remain a challenge. While the unrest in Kashmir, which has become an annual fixture in the summers, hardly affects apple growers, it is the tourism industry that bears the brunt all the time. On a recent trip to Pahalgam, a roadside salesman who was trying to sell a waistcoat said that I could pay him anything I wanted - the man said he hadn’t made a penny for days on end. The BJP-led Centre may do well by bringing some relief to people who are dependent on tourism.  A majority of them do see their future with India. A complete overhaul of the current policy which rewards separatists by offering plum jobs to their kin in the state government has to be done away with as early as possible. Kashmiris have waited for nearly three decades for an elusive ""normalcy"" to return. The government should take it upon itself to empower those people who want to live under the Constitution. We've seen the army  under the Sadbhavana Mission. More such outreach programs are needed to give voice to those who get silenced by the radical fringe. A long-term Governor’s Rule is very likely. The BJP should take this as an opportunity and shun the status quo which has always resulted in dire consequences for those who have favoured India. India’s Kashmir policy has been a blunder of epic proportions. No government has shown the desire to resolve, much less acknowledge it. Solving this mess may take decades but it is important that we make a start. Quick fixes or crisis management will hardly help anyone, let alone the Indian state. What the Centre really needs is a vision and action plan to take this forward. We have had enough of interlocutor-run talks which invariably lead to dead ends. It is time we get serious about Kashmir.",2018-06-20,"Rajnath Singh,Narendra Modi,Mehbooba Mufti,PDP",Governor’s rule in J&K: How Centre should make amends in Kashmir,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kashmir-jammu-bjp-pdp-mehbooba-mufti-narendra-modi-rajnath-singh/story/1/25005.html
324,Sushant Sareen,"Notwithstanding their ideological pretensions, there was nothing unholy or unnatural about the PDP-BJP alliance in Jammu and Kashmir.And regardless of the spin the two parties put both while getting into bed together, and after their break-up, it was a purely political deal for political purposes, just like any other such deal anywhere else in the country — Karnataka comes to mind immediately. On paper at least, there was logic in the coalition. First, the math thrown up by the state election meant that short of going in for another election, this was the only workable coalition. Second, the fact that PDP predominantly represented the Valley and BJP Jammu region meant that their constituencies didn’t overlap, and to that extent they were complementary to each other, at least insofar as J&K was concerned. Finally, the fractured and regionally split mandate meant that this coalition promised all regions representation in the state government. But while the math and logic commended the coalition, the chemistry militated against it. In the end, it was negative chemistry and the fact that the BJP’s national political interests conflicted with its obsession for being part of the J&K government that led to the break-up. Forget the nationalist gloss that the BJP is putting on its decision, the bottom line is that the coalition wasn’t working on the ground. While the PDP that failed to bring around its constituency to support the coalition, the BJP’s core constituency also sulked over the compromise with what it saw as a soft separatist party. After a three-year-long roller-coaster cohabitation, the coalition had indeed become untenable — politically, it was damaging both parties which felt that continuing with the alliance would only bring diminishing returns; the governance was feckless and administration was dysfunctional; the security situation was deteriorating by the day and the government was unable to arrest the slide; ideologically, the incongruity of the alliance was becoming increasingly unmanageable. The talk of imposing the Governor’s rule had been in the air for months. To be fair to both parties, at least at the top leadership level, efforts were made to cut some slack for the partners on controversial issues — among other things, withdrawing cases against stone-pelters, the position taken by the government on the Article 35A issue, and of course, the Ramzan ceasefire. The failure of the ceasefire, not just in terms of the attacks that took place but also in terms of the inability of the PDP to initiate a political reconciliation process of any sort, seemed to be the last straw for the alliance. A big part of the problem was that the PDP was unable to end its “soft on separatists” politics. In fact, in her press conference after the BJP withdrew from the coalition, Mehbooba Mufti alluded to all that her party had done to provide relief and even succour to the separatist/terrorist gang. The PDP’s continuing flirtation with the separatists and terrorists was proving to be very damaging for the BJP in rest of India, robbing it of one of its self-arrogated USPs of being tough on national security. With the alliance now broken, both parties will play to their galleries — the PDP has already started singing the tune of how it had tried to protect the people from a heavy-handed crackdown, while the BJP is blowing its trumpet on how the government will now go hell for leather after the terrorists. The problem, however, is that the political flight path in the state remains riven with uncertainty. The BJP seems muddled about the roadmap for the future. The party’s point-man on Kashmir has declared that “in order to bring situation under control, we have decided that is it time... for a spell of the Governor’s rule. After the situation is restored, we will consider what to do in the future…” Sounds good in theory but the situation is unlikely to be “restored” or “stabilised” in weeks or months, and may even take a few years. Going in for a fresh mandate isn’t possible in the foreseeable future. After all, if it wasn’t possible to hold a by-election in the Lok Sabha constituency vacated by the chief minister, then holding state-wide elections seems inconceivable any time soon. Even if by some miracle the situation evolves in a way that allows for elections to be held in the next few months, it will only mean going back to where we started when the Governor’s rule was imposed. This is because without first dismantling the ecosystem that nurtures and sustains separatism and terrorism — cleansing the administration, weeding out subversives and agent provocateurs, demolishing the funding networks of separatists, detoxifying the educational institutions, all of which will take a lot of doing — restoring the political process will tantamount to repeating the entire sordid cycle once again. But a prolonged Governor’s, or President’s rule, will bring with it its own problems. Once the initial euphoria over the end of an increasingly dysfunctional, corrupt and unpopular government is over, discontent with the bureaucratic dispensation will invariably start to set in. At that stage, there will no longer be the buffer of a political leadership to take the flak for non-delivery of services and non-redressal of grievances. The entire ire will be directed on New Delhi. We would also do well to remember that restoring the political process in 1996 after a long spell on Central rule, has often been touted as a signal achievement, something we have used often to our advantage in international forums. The Indian state must use the opportunity that the political crisis has offered to fix the many things that are broken in the state. More importantly, once the situation is retrieved, we shouldn’t make the mistake of lifting our eye off the ball and letting things slide again. Finally, all parties must eschew the temptation of playing silly political games of the sorts played in the 1980s which pushed things over the edge.

325,Pooja Shali,"The Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) decision to   of the three-year-old alliance with People's Democratic Party (PDP) in Jammu and Kashmir caught everyone unawares, including senior BJP ministers in the state. The party high command kept its cards close to its chest right till the last moment. So, when 15 J&K BJP representatives arrived on the morning of June 19 in Delhi, all they could tell the media was that the meeting had been called solely to discuss ""organisational structure ahead of 2019 parliamentary elections"". The leaders were, however, sceptical of the urgent summon, especially considering the fact that BJP president Amit Shah was scheduled to visit Jammu on June 23. Since ""no clear agenda"" was set for the meeting on June 19, the BJP representatives were not particularly apprehensive. Surprisingly, even NSA Ajit Doval's unusual visit to Amit Shah also did not cause any stir about might follow. Former deputy CM Kavinder Gupta went on record to say that while prevailing tensions in the state will be discussed in the meeting, the alliance will stay for now. Quite clearly most leaders remained in the dark about the decision till it was announced. Only Ravinder Raina, state BJP chief, claimed the agenda of the meeting was to ensure the next chief minister will be from BJP and the party's plan to contest alone in 2019. He evaded questions on whether BJP will continue with PDP and maintained that party's decision will be final. By late afternoon, the agenda of the meeting became clear - end alliance with the PDP. What happened at the meeting? According to the leaders present at the meeting that took place at the BJP headquarters, the J&K leaders reached the party office by 11.40am and were asked to wait for a while till senior leaders arrived. Their wait lasted for approximately half hour. Senior party leader Ram Madhav entered the hall and seated himself among his party colleagues. Madhav then informed party leaders that after long deliberations, the party had decided it was best to end the alliance. Madhav cited security issues and state interests as reasons why the alliance with PDP was untenable. He then enquired if any leader disagreed with the decision and even paused for interjections. Given Madhav's stature in the party and his hold on the party's politics in the state, no objections were obviously raised. It was then that Shah joined the meeting and greeted party leaders. The ministers and general secretaries announced unanimous support to Madhav and Shah and their decision to sever ties with the PDP. The BJP has 25 MLAs in J&K. Madhav is reported to have even asked a senior leader if November would be best suited for fresh elections. Since Governor's Rule usually lasts from three to six months, elections could be held around November. The state leaders were asked about party's preparations in the state given that elections are now inevitable. State leaders have requested for a few days to get back to the central leadership with a concrete answer. The BJP is likely to start preparing for elections right away. When party leaders returned to the J&K House, Kavinder Gupta told reporters: ""Central leadership took the final decision. Governor's Rule is the best option. We will emerge stronger."" Despite not being consulted over the move, BJP representatives have largely welcomed the break-up. The BJP plans to now propel a strong nationalist image and brand itself as a party which refuses to bow down to other parties and is willing to pull out of the government when nation's sovereignty is in danger. The BJP lost massive ground in Jammu in the last few months. It was becoming difficult for the party to defend itself on issues of illegal foreign settlements, border tensions and indiscriminate killings in border towns. The alienation being felt by the people in the Jammu and Ladakh regions had reached a tipping point. The party now hopes to gain the lost ground. It will be interesting to see if this pullout from the government proves to be a masterstroke for the BJP.

326,Ashok Upadhyay,"After the   in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday (June 19), former chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah spoke to the media after calling on governor NN Vohra. He demanded early elections in the state.   While the Congress has clearly stated that it will not support the PDP, after governor Vohra, concluding his consultations with all major political parties in the state, forwarded his report to the president of India for imposition of governor’s rule under Section 92 of the Constitution of J&K. On Wednesday, president Ram Nath Kovind approved the imposition of governor's rule. However, it is not  a long- term solution. The governor can also dissolve the House and call for fresh polls. But how conducive is the situation to hold elections in the state? In April last year, eight people were killed in firing by security forces in election-day violence that marred the by-poll for Srinagar Lok Sabha seat. The voter turnout was an all-time low of 7.14 per cent. A month later, mere 2 per cent turnout was witnessed in the re-polling held in 38 polling stations. It was the lowest percentage in the state’s history. No votes were polled in Khansahib Assembly segment while only three votes were cast in Budgam segment. The overall polling percentage for the seat had to be revised to 7.13 per cent from 7.14 per cent. National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah defeated the PDP candidate, Nazir Khan, by a margin of over 10,700 votes. While Abdullah polled around 48,554 votes, Khan got 37,779 votes. By no yardstick this can be called a proper election. Even in 2014 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections, voting in this constituency was around 26 percentage. On September 24, 2002, the day terrorists attacked the Akshardham temple in Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir in the midst of the second phase of the four-phased Assembly elections. Even then, the turnout was about 41 per cent on that day. Indian political parties and the Ministry of External Affairs have repeatedly held up high voter turnouts in the state since 1996 as a vote of confidence in New Delhi. The Srinagar by-election, however, painted a very pale picture of the conduction election in the Valley. The case of Anantnag Lok Sabha seat was the worst. Mehbooba Mufti vacated this seat in June 2016 to become the chief minister. In the 2017 by-election, her brother Tassaduq Hussain contested the election as the PDP candidate. The by-election was cancelled a day before polling due to violence. With the law and order situation on a downward spiral, the EC has not been able to hold the by-poll till date. With that the by-poll in Anantnag has been delayed for the longest time in the country since 1996. With less than a year left for the next general elections, there is every possibility of it continuing to stay vacant until then. Prior to 1996, when the current rule on filling a vacancy within six months came into effect, there were few examples of long delays in conducting polls in violence-affected areas. In early 2018, the EC decided to take stock of the situation depending on if the state holds panachayat elections and how peacefully they fare. However, with the state unable to conduct elections to local bodies till date, the possibility of holding the by-poll grew dim. As late as on April 17, 2018, governor Vohra came out with a third reminder to then chief minister Mehbooba Mufti for holding elections to the urban local bodies and panchayats in state, which have been pending for eight and two years respectively. The panchayat elections were last held in the state in April-May 2011 while urban local bodies elections were last held in January 2005. These examples clearly suggest that the situation in the state at present is not conducive for a free and fair election.  ",2018-06-20,"NN Vohra,Amit Shah,Mehbooba Mufti,BJP-PDP break-up",BJP-PDP break-up: Is Kashmir ready for fresh elections?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bjp-pdp-break-up-mehbooba-mufti-amit-shah-rajnath-singh-ram-nath-kovind-nn-vohra-omar-abdullah/story/1/25000.html
327,Rajeev Sharma,"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and   loves to stage dharnas or sit-ins at the drop of a hat, quite often taking his political pyrotechnics to ludicrous levels. But the problem is that his second and current tenure as Delhi chief minister coincides with a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government at the Centre, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi whose political conduct is based on the same principle: Offence is the best defence. The result is daily confrontations and acrimonious spats between   and BJP-led central government with people of Delhi ending up as sole victims. The latest in the long list of these standoffs is the weeklong sit-in by Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia and ministers Satyendar Jain and Gopal Rai in the waiting room of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal's house demanding that IAS officers end their ""strike"" and approve doorstep ration delivery scheme of his government. Incidentally, the IAS officers' association held a press conference on Sunday (June 17) and denied being on strike and also refuted AAP's claim that they are biased towards the Centre. Things came to a boil on Sunday evening when thousands of AAP supporters attempted to take a procession to the prime minister's residence but were stopped by the Delhi Police on the ground that prior permission had not been sought for the march. As a result of the stalemate, central Delhi remained in a state of lockdown for hours and Delhi Metro authorities shut down five stations on the advice of the police, inconveniencing thousands of commuters. But the significant aspect about this march was that it was joined by hundreds of CPM cadres. CPM leader Sitaram Yechury tweeted thus ahead of the march: 
 
 This brings us to an important political aspect of this developing story: More and more Opposition parties have waded into the ongoing political standoff in support of Kejriwal, who seems to have become the latest rallying point for Opposition parties which are not fighting shy of displaying their unity against the monolith of BJP after a string of victories in recent by-elections in many states. Kejriwal has found support from east and south as four chief ministers - West Bengal's Mamata Banerjee, Andhra Pradesh's N Chandrababu Naidu, Karnataka's HD Kumaraswamy and Kerala's Pinarayi Vijayan - have lent open support to him. First, they tried to meet Kejriwal at his sit-in site at the L-G's residence on June 16 but were ""denied"" permission. The four chief ministers then scored a valuable brownie point by trooping to Kejriwal's residence and met his wife Sunita and conveyed their solid support to Kejriwal's fight against the Modi government. On June 17, they took up the matter with PM Modi at a NITI Aayog meeting. The ongoing AAP-BJP tiff is no longer a Delhi-centric news and has acquired national dimensions as the BJP and the rest of the Opposition prepare for the next general elections due by April 2019. The development has several important repercussions all major stakeholders. India's newest political party which has been ruling Delhi for the last 40 months has been forced to bear the brunt of brutal central government powers led by the BJP by way of raids on the premises of the party, ministers and office-bearers. The period has slapping of many criminal cases against them by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and repeated undermining of the democratically elected AAP government through the office of the L-G. But the present episode shows that finally Kejriwal has managed to tilt the political scales in his favour as he secured support from four chief ministers, each of whom is an important leader of the ruling party in his or her state. This will embolden AAP further and the Modi government will be prolonging the standoff at its own peril. The standoff has come at a time when Delhi has been in the grip of a severe pollution crisis and just when the residents of Delhi needed a government that tackles this public health hazard in double quick time they found that the chief minister, the deputy chief minister and two ministers, including health minister Satyendra Jain, are staging a dharna in the air-conditioned waiting room of the L-G House. An equally important point to be mentioned in this context is that of the 15 years on the trot Sheila Dikshit served as Delhi chief minister. From December 1998 to December 2013, she spent nearly six of her initial years when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government was ruling the Centre. During this period no such drama of daily confrontations with the Centre took place. Perhaps that was because Vajpayee was a large-hearted liberal prime minister and Sheila Dikshit knew the art of surviving like the tongue survives between two sets of teeth. Kejriwal has miserably failed in learning this art. The conduct of the Modi government has been dubious in dealing with non-BJP governments in different states. The Centre under Modi has repeatedly used the office of the governor and the L-G for obstructing the work of elected governments particularly in places like Delhi and Puducherry. This kind of conduct goes contrary to amicable Centre-state relations and in fact compels various Opposition parties to join ranks to take on the BJP. This is precisely what has happened this time. Never before during the past 40-month-long AAP rule the Opposition regional satraps had come to the rescue of AAP as they have done this time. This is a warning shot for the Modi government which it can ignore at its own peril. It's time for PM Modi to make an immediate and positive intervention. The much-talked about Opposition unity, which has worked wonders of late, is a mirage in the context of Delhi. The reason is that the Congress has not only stayed away from the efforts of the four chief ministers to bat for Kejriwal's cause but has also taken a belligerent stand against AAP with former chief minister Sheila Dikshit and Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken attacking Kejriwal for his protest. This is because the Congress is fancying chances of its electoral victory and appears confident that the people of Delhi will reject both the warring parties in the next election. It's not for nothing that Congress president Rahul Gandhi did not invite Kejriwal or any AAP leader for his iftaar party last week. This stance of the Congress should send cheers in the BJP camp.",2018-06-18,"Narendra Modi,Rahul Gandhi,Opposition unity,Arvind Kejriwal",Why Kejriwal getting support of 4 non-BJP chief ministers should worry Modi,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-protest-arvind-kejriwal-opposition-unity-rahul-gandhi-narendra-modi-ias-officers-on-strike/story/1/24950.html
328,Srijana Mitra Das,"A day before Eid, four men were killed by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. The death of one –  , editor-in-chief of the daily   – was met with an outpouring of grief, particularly and understandably, from his fellow journalists.  But the death of his two security officers, killed when terrorists fired on Bukhari’s vehicle just outside his newspaper office in Srinagar – went relatively un-mourned by the same. The outpouring of grief for Bukhari was massive. In comparison, the condolences for the security officers were relatively few and far between. The same was the case for army rifleman Aurangzeb, abducted reportedly by Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists while on his way home for Eid – among other gifts,   – tortured brutally over hours, then shot dead, his face and head left in bits by their bullets Aurangzeb was 25. When he joined the army as a fresh-faced young lad hailing from a rural Poonch family, one with an illustrious record – his father, Mohd Haneef, had been a sepoy in the J&K Light Infantry, his other sons serving the Indian Army – Aurangzeb’s face was very round. An ID card shows him as a young boy, with a short mop of thick black hair, and a face that looked like he had been fed rice, kanti and kheer by the hands of a loving, doting mother. Slowly, Aurangzeb’s face changed. It grew leaner, his cheekbones sharply defined, his hair longer, his eyes sparkling with confidence, with skills, with living life. His father has the same eyes. But Aurangzeb’s father’s eyes aren’t smiling now. They are full of suffering, of pain, the man, dressed in a thin grey shalwar-kameez, standing still, yet seeming blown away. Like within him, there was nothing, just a raging storm. A storm that takes over everything inside you. It twists and turns and pulls and pushes your heart till you are sure this has broken and flown away in a billion little bits. The sort of storm that makes you fall over and howl. Despite this, Aurangzeb’s father didn’t weep. Instead, he promised to send more of his sons to the Indian Army. ""If we don’t fight to defend our nation, who will?"" he  It’s a great question. Not just because of its ethical power but its clarity, its honesty in this age of polished falsehoods. That we live in a time of twisting truths and crushing lies was in full evidence in some of the reactions apparently condemning Shujaat Bukhari’s death. Many of these were deeply genuine. How could these not be for a human being, a journalist, an editor, just an unarmed man riding in a vehicle in his town – such a strange town, full of aching, breaking wooden buildings, ringed with mighty hills, a town a pale sun rises on but never fully warms – had been killed by a gang of vicious, violent cowards? But some of these reactions were more than heartfelt. Very swiftly, a little ""liberal lynch mob"" formed and went for one of Bukhari’s recent critics in a manner that can adequately be described as ""armchair-caveman"". On the very evening he was killed, a ""liberal-arty"" mob tried to gang up against Anand Ranganathan, a right-wing commentator who’d raised objections to Bukhari’s purported views (on limits to the freedom of expression over religion) at a recent Delhi event. Bukhari had responded strongly but civilly over Twitter and the matter rested there. Till Bukhari was killed a few days later. ""Are you happy now"", snarled some of his mourners then, inexplicably but savagely at Ranganathan. ""Shujaat is dead and your words helped murder him!"" ""You are responsible for his death"", some screeched online. ""And then, he died,"" others moaned, in some sort of stale-cheese imitation of a mawkish newspaper headline once given to a terrorist hung by the Indian state. ""Hope you're happy Anand Ranganathan to smear someone when he wasn't even there to defend himself. You are sick and a shame on journalism."" 
 
 
 
 Others were still shorter on subtlety: ""Paid trolls like Anand Ranganathan, who have zero journalistic experience, have no business sitting on a high horse, pinning agendas on journalists & editors who do actual fucking reporting. And face bullets."" Clearly, irony had also died. Or it was very, very sick, resembling what Pankaj Mishra, in his recent   essay  , quotes Arthur Koestler on, ""The deterioration of the intelligentsia…is as much a symptom of disease as the corruption of the ruling class…"" Nowhere could the ‘deterioration of the intelligentsia’ be plainer. Here was a 'liberal' (presumably they’d not disagree with this classification) 'intelligentsia', trying to name and shame someone for expressing his views on Bukhari’s reported views. Since when did that become a crime? And since when did the hoodlums of the Hizb, the louts of the Lashkar, become so sophisticated as to drop the rocks or rifles in their hands and hear people debate at conferences, to draw up their hit-lists accordingly? Since never. It’s not that the ""liberal lynch mob"" didn’t know this. But grieving over Bukhari thus – and attacking a random commentator alongside – gave an opportunity to do something else. Make this about themselves. Some of the tweets that attacked Ranganathan do attest to the deep frustration with the right-wing the (that oxymoronic term) ""left-liberal"" in India feels. The frustration is not because of any deep-rooted commitment to real secularism, for most of these liberals happily align with the Congress that has been responsible for being in power – and duty – during the 1984 riots against Sikhs, the Hashimpura massacre, the decades of brutal human rights violations, twisted torture, the choking suppression of civil freedoms in Kashmir. No, this isn’t about sticking up for any ideals. This is about sticking up for a comfort zone, which the 2014 elections jolted many Indian ""liberal"" sofas so far out of. There is no denying the Hindu right wing’s idea of ""intellectuals"" can leave you falling over laughing in ironic pain. But often, the two-facedness of the ‘secular’ liberal does exactly the same. This was another such bitter occasion. The swift transition of the outpouring of grief, to the virtual assaulting of a passing-by commentator – ostensibly over 'Shujaat, my good friend', whom I just met in Delhi/Lisbon/the Republic of Khan Market – showed it all. My friend Shujaat, who was a brave journalist.  Like me – I too am a brave journalist.  I too am under grave threat.  I too have been saying this constantly, telling everyone I meet about how my freedom of expression has been quashed over the last four years. I have written in every newspaper, foreign and desi, about how I am being totally suppressed in Delhi. I am on Twitter 24x7 talking about how my right to speak is curtailed. I even get death threats while posting my vacay pictures on Instagram. And all this goes on, despite me telling everyone every single day of how many death threats I got today. 'Just like Shujaat.' This papier-mache circus — and that's what truly pops up when 'the story' appears in the seventh paragraph of a media star’s story about 'the story', which is not 'the story' but herself — is why Bukhari’s brutal, horrifying death became the chattering, clattering media event it did. And this is why Aurangzeb’s death — no less horrifying; the young soldier was filmed in a video just before he was shot, where his captors shoot questions about his unit, his role in killing their compadre, called, in the best style of the street hoodlum, ""Tiger Saleem"", a video where his eyes look straight into the camera, strangely calm, his face saint-like, him looking slightly dazedly at his hand, broken in an encounter some time back (perhaps sometimes, it still hurt) — received relative radio silence. The response from Kashmir has been the predictable paradox, half-sullen silence, half-traumatised shock. But while thousands have posted their reactions online, the comparative quiet from elite 'íntellectual' circles is quite marked.  Because, come on, what was Aurangzeb but a  ? Yes, he made the supreme sacrifice – but isn’t that what soldiers – and PSOs, like Bukhaari’s – are   to do? They’re the porters of nation-building, its workers, its chowkidars. They’re not English-speaking intellectual types. They’re not People Like Us. They don’t go shopping in Khan Market for blueberries and blue cheese. They don’t wear white linen against which their copies of   gleam. They don’t get invited to conferences abroad or air their views on TV every night. No one   them their views, for that matter. We want ‘dialogue’ with the brutes who kill them, but we don’t want to know what   views are. We only hear their names once they are killed – and swiftly forget these to talk about our own again. The shameful treatment accorded to Aurangzeb by some thus was displayed once more in the reaction to the   announced by the Indian government. 'Tragic'. 'Appalling'. 'Shocking', came the cries. 'Again, innocent civilians waving their little ISIS flags, only trying to lynch the army to gain their fundamental rights, will get brutally mowed down by our big, bad, bullying forces.' Indeed. But I, for one, am relieved the ceasefire is done. And that, at least, while the liberals, the intellectuals and the valiantly well-dressed defenders of the freedom of speech and the free press will speak on, his unit will try to avenge rifleman Aurangzeb. Whose face was once rounded with the rice a loving mother fed him. Whose eyes were exactly like his father's – but those are full of suffering, and agonising pride, today.",2018-06-18,"Liberals,Ramzan ceasefire,Jammu and Kashmir,Shujaat  bukhari",No one killed Aurangzeb — Fewer tears for Kashmir's slain soldier shows 'liberal' lack of empathy,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/shujaat-bukhari-j-and-k-ramzan-ceasefire-who-killed-aurangzeb-liberals/story/1/24968.html
329,Anand Kochukudy,"The sit-in of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Cabinet colleagues at the office of the lieutenant-general (L-G) completes a week today (June 18). Last Monday, after a resolution demanding full statehood got adopted in the Vidhan Sabha, Kejriwal and his colleagues met L-G Anil Baijal at his office seeking his intervention in the alleged strike by IAS officers and have stayed put since. While Kejriwal is not new to such agitations and sit-ins, the latest crisis has been precipitated on account of an alleged physical assault of Delhi's chief secretary Anshu Prakash by a couple of Aam Aadmi Party(AAP) MLAs in the presence of Kejriwal. While that matter is sub-judice and looks like an open-and-shut case as the   and a   of the chief minister's adviser under section 364 (to a magistrate) corroborates the version of Prakash, the fact that Kejriwal didn't offer an apology to his chief secretary made things worse. In fact, the AAP has been claiming that it's a false case. It was followed by the three associations of IAS officers passing   to have only written communication with the political executive until Kejriwal tendered an apology. They also followed it up with more resolutions like observing five minutes' silence at the beginning of lunch hour every day and not visiting the camp offices or residences of members of the political executive. On Sunday (June 17), the IAS Association held an unprecedented press conference to deny the charges of going on strike as the AAP claimed and contended that they worked as usual. The chief minister held out an olive branch on Sunday evening when he tweeted an appeal to the IAS officers to get back to work with full vigour promising them safety and security. 
 
 What can be concluded is that the chief minister failed miserably in taking his bureaucracy along and instilling confidence in them after the alleged manhandling of the chief secretary and this was an avoidable confrontation — unless there are ulterior motives involved. When Kejriwal claimed the bureaucrats have been instigated by the central government to carry on with their symbolic strike, he sought to make this a political battle. While this sit-in doesn't seem to have much public support — especially among the middle class — that hasn't deterred the AAP from going ahead with it. With his credibility taking a massive hit following his apology to Arun Jaitley and others in multiple defamation suits, Kejriwal seems to be gambling on the appeal of agitation politics to recapture public imagination. Although it is true that the BJP government at the Centre has made life tough for the AAP government in Delhi, it was the setbacks in courts that have left the Delhi government in a state of crisis. On May 21, 2015, within three months of the Kejriwal government assuming charge, the central government issued a notification which effectively made L-G the exclusive authority on transfers and postings of bureaucrats. This was followed by a hue and cry and a slew of petitions by AAP in the high court. However, the Delhi HC in August 2016 delivered a verdict which once again dealt a blow to Kejriwal. The Delhi High Court held that state was only a Union Territory and that the chief minister and Cabinet couldn't take policy decisions — even on matters where the legislative Assembly has the power to make laws — without the concurrence of the L-G. The Delhi government was left in the unenviable position of having the authority to legislate, without the authority to execute these laws (Without L-G's consent). ""On a reading of Article 239 and Article 239AA of the Constitution together with the provisions of the government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 and the Transaction of Business of the Government of NCT of Delhi Rules, 1993, it becomes manifest that Delhi continues to be a Union Territory even after the Constitution (69th Amendment) Act, 1991 inserting Article 239AA making special provisions with respect to Delhi,"" the HC verdict read. This HC order also held that the multiple inquiry commissions Kejriwal commissioned were illegal. That was another blow as the one-man inquiry committee of Gopal Subramanian — constituted to probe the DDCA scam involving Arun Jaitley — had also to be disbanded. This inquiry commission was Kejriwal's deterrent and the ace he held against Arun Jaitley's defamation suit. The verdict in turn led to a meek apology when it became clear that he would risk going to jail otherwise. The HC order was challenged in the Supreme Court and the verdict by a Constitution bench was reserved in December 2017, following the culmination of the trial. This protest, at a time the verdict in the Constitution Bench challenge is awaited (following the summer break), smacks of desperation or is clearly aimed at gaining political capital. Despite his legitimate grouse against the central government for making life tough for him, the ball is actually in the court of the Supreme Court now. And this sit-in at the L-G's office has very little to do with either the central government or the courts. A section of intellectuals has already come out in unison backing the AAP protest. It got further mileage when   led by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee expressed their solidarity and sought a meeting with Kejriwal on June 16. The press conference held by the chief ministers in the national capital helped Kejriwal's protest gain legitimacy among the wider public and grab eyeballs across the nation. The question everyone's been asking is why Congress hasn't backed Kejriwal. Some people lay the blame on Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ajay Maken's door even as they sought to inculpate Rahul Gandhi for ignoring the larger picture. The question is why is Opposition unity always predicated on Congress' accommodation? By the way, people have short memories. Does anyone recall how a magnanimous Congress propped up newbie AAP in 2013 when they fell short of majority? Would any other party be magnanimous enough to offer such an unconditional support to an abusive ally? As for the present situation, it is completely the doing of Kejriwal that a mere apology could solve. Why should anyone else stick up for the AAP to defend them on this self-inflicted crisis? Congress has many faults but it doesn't have to get subsumed by the regional parties and take the fight to straight to the BJP as some people tend to believe. There is a bigger question the liberal intelligentsia backing AAP has to answer. What did Kejriwal mean when he stated on the floor of the legislative Assembly that he   if Delhi was granted full statehood before 2019? That certainly didn't seem like rhetoric. And what happened to Opposition unity then?",2018-06-18,"Anil Baijal,Lieutenant Governor,Aap protest,Arvind Kejriwal",Why the crisis in Delhi is of Arvind Kejriwal's own making,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/arvind-kejriwal-aap-protest-lieutenant-governor-anil-baijal-bjp-aap-ias-officers-on-strike/story/1/24965.html
330,Priyanka Kakkar,"Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s sit-in protest at lieutenant governor Anil Baijal’s residence has given us a peek into what a possible mahagatbandhan for the 2019 elections could look like. Over the last four days, parties from across the country have expressed their solidarity with the Aam Aadmi Party and have hit out at the BJP for its attack on India’s democratic, federal foundation. On this issue, the two national parties, the Congress and the BJP have been isolated by an evolving coalition being forged by a young, fresh leadership of smaller parties. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee was the first to tweet on June 14, demanding that the elected CM of Delhi must get his due respect. This was followed by the Left parties expressing their strong opposition to the L-G’s unconstitutional actions, with senior CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat joining a group of protesting AAP leaders at Raj Ghat yesterday. 
 
Sitaram Yechury tweeted lashing out at the Centre for obstructing the constitutional discharge of duties of the state government. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to the prime minister, urging his personal intervention to ensure the Delhi government’s work can proceed without hindrance. Former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha and rebel BJP MP Shatrugan Sinha have both attacked the prime minister for creating this unfortunate situation in the national capital. The reaction of the Left parties and the TMC was not surprising, considering the strong personal equation Kejriwal enjoys with leaders of the two parties. The statement issued by Kamal Haasan in solidarity with the AAP is a sign that the Haasan-Kejriwal bonhomie seen at the launch of the Tamil Nadu politician’s new party recently was not a flash in the pan. Those tracking parliamentary proceedings have noticed the coordination between these parties on the floor of the House over the past few years. What has stirred intrigue, however, is the vociferous and spirited support coming from the next generation of the erstwhile third front experiments — Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, Rashtriya Lok Dal’s Jayant Chaudhary and Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Tejashwi Yadav. This is the first time these three parties, which are currently seen as some of the Congress’ biggest potential allies in the battle for 2019, have voiced their support for the AAP. In fact, Tejashwi Yadav and Jayant Chaudhary went beyond giving issue-based support and endorsed Kejriwal’s model of governance. With such an outpouring of support from across the country, the Congress remains the only major non-NDA party to refrain from standing with the AAP against the BJP government’s high-handedness and undemocratic action. To his credit, Rahul Gandhi has maintained his silence on the matter, unlike Delhi Congress leader Ajay Maken. In the wake of a national consensus in favour of Kejriwal’s fight for Delhi’s democratic rights, Maken’s continued attacks on the AAP place the Congress’ Delhi unit, firmly in the BJP’s corner. Succumbing to Maken’s blackmail and tantrums, Rahul Gandhi appears to have made a critical mistake in the run-up to the to the 2019 elections. Gandhi’s refusal to speak up for the legitimate rights of the people of Delhi has led to the shaping up of an alternate mahagatbandhan. The Congress’s failure to build bridges with a major anti-BJP party has jeopardised its aspiration to be the fulcrum for the united Opposition. Regional players have signalled that they will not be toeing the Congress line when it comes to building the potential alliance. Non-Congress, non-NDA parties have come to realise that the AAP is too strong a force in the Punjab-Haryana-Delhi region to be made a pariah. The Congress’ closeted support to the BJP against Kejriwal is a reminder to regional leaders of the Congress’ demonstrated ability to collude with the BJP to ensure a two-party system wherever possible. In an interview with NDTV this week, Tejashwi Yadav was asked who will be the prime minister if a United Opposition is to go past the half-way mark in 2019. The Bihar leader responded by saying that all parties which are potential allies in the mahagatbandhan have leaders capable of becoming prime minister. This was clearly a message to the Congress to not expect the leadership on a platter. After being reduced to its lowest ever Lok Sabha tally of 44 in 2014, the Congress is no more seen as the natural leader by regional parties. If the Congress is sincere about leading a national coalition, it needs to show it has the maturity and foresight needed to build alliances. The Delhi crisis was an opportune moment for the party to demonstrate it has what it takes to build a consensus. However, by siding with the BJP, it has only found itself isolated, surrounded by like-minded regional players who appear to be more ideologically committed to the idea of a BJP-free India than India’s grand old party.",2018-06-15,"Anil Baijal,Mahagatbandhan,Aap protest,Arvind Kejriwal",How Arvind Kejriwal's protest has 'cobbled up' an alternative mahagatbandhan for 2019 general elections,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/arvind-kejriwal-aap-opposition-mahagatbandhan-anil-baijal-lok-sabha-2019-polls-bjp-modi-government/story/1/24910.html
331,Brahma Chellaney,"With the Singapore summit yielding only a joint statement, US President Donald Trump has bet on what he called a “very special bond” and “terrific relationship” with North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un to secure a real nuclear deal. It is worth remembering, however, that Trump has said similar things about several other foreign leaders, only to ignore their interests or turn on them later. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, for example, is still licking his wounds. As Trump’s announcement to suspend US war games with South Korea underscored, he is seeking to narrowly advance American interests, including saving money. However, he has correctly described as “very provocative” the US-led war games, which, with live-fire drills, simulate every spring a full-scale invasion of North Korea. US critics are upset that he has lifted the pretence that these war games are routine “military exercises” and defensive in nature. When Trump last August threatened to rain “fire and fury like the world has never seen” on North Korea, his critics at home accused him of leading the US to war. But today, after he became the first sitting American president to meet a North Korean leader, they are charging him with moving too quickly to peace. The removal of the threat of war on the Korean Peninsula has come as a relief in East Asia and beyond. Trump is right that, at this stage, fundamentally changing the US-North Korea relationship matters more than denuclearisation. If the West encourages Kim’s efforts to modernise the North Korean economy, it will help moderate his regime’s behaviour. Economic engagement can achieve a lot more than economic sanctions, which counterproductively accelerated North Korea’s nuclear and missile advances. Trump has acknowledged the huge gamble he has taken on North Korea by telling reporters, “I may be wrong. I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, 'Hey, I was wrong.’” He then paused and, with refreshing candour, said, “I don’t know that I’ll ever admit that, but I’ll find some kind of an excuse.” Kim may have emerged as the summit’s clear winner merely because the world’s most powerful leader met him virtually as an equal. But critics are wrong in claiming that Trump made “big concessions” in exchange for securing indefinable commitments from Kim. The only concession Trump made — suspension of war games as a gesture of good faith — is easily reversible if negotiations do not yield progress toward denuclearisation. Progress, however, will be slow to come. Trump himself said before the summit that his meeting with Kim would mark just the beginning of a process. In fact, the joint statement implicitly links denuclearisation to “mutual confidence building,” thus setting in motion a complex, long process of bargaining, deal-making and, if all goes well, denuclearising. No less important is the joint statement’s reference to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, not just North Korea. This goal, in effect, means a nuclear-weapons-free zone, whose creation demands not just North Korea’s denuclearisation but also important concessions by the US and South Korea (and also by the other two nuclear powers in the region, China and Russia). Yet this key outcome is being glossed over in the American debate. A nuclear-weapons-free zone can emerge only if South Korea steps out of the US nuclear umbrella and the US, China and Russia formally commit not to introduce, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. Such a scenario will leave Japan as the sole country in Asia under the US nuclear umbrella. There can be no nuke-free Korean Peninsula if South Korea refuses to leave the nuclear umbrella. One concern is that, as part of a deal, North Korea might seek to retain the short- and medium-range portion of its nuclear arsenal while dismantling its long-range nuclear capability that threatens America. Japan, in particular, is worried that, just as the US has put up with Pakistan’s sub-regionally confined nuclear arsenal, Washington could tolerate a similar North Korean capability as long as it does not threaten America. This scenario is no longer implausible, especially with the Trump administration saying goodbye to the “Libya model” and seeking instead to apply the “South Africa model” to North Korea. The administration’s early brinkmanship almost derailed the Singapore summit when Trump and his national security adviser spoke about the Libya model, suggesting that Kim follow a path that ultimately led to Muammar Gaddafi’s gruesome end. But now, recognising North Korean resistance to intrusive international inspections, US officials say their role model is white apartheid-era, South Africa. Before transiting to black majority rule, South Africa secretly dismantled its six nuclear weapons, destroying all major documents relating to them but stashing weapons-grade enriched uranium. It then opened its sites to international inspection. Such voluntary denuclearisation without international monitoring could allow Kim to keep sub-regionally confined capability. In any event, denuclearisation will be a long-drawn-out process. Nuclear weapons are the only assets North Korea can leverage to end its international pariah status. Kim is unlikely to give up his “crown jewels” without US security guarantees that go beyond symbolic steps. Nor will he unilaterally disarm without reciprocal steps by South Korea and America. If he gives up long-range capability but retains other atomic assets, North Korea will be like Pakistan on the global nuclear map.

332,Sushant Sareen,"The killing of Shujaat Bukhari, Editor-in-Chief of  , has unleashed a flood of emotional outpourings among the tribe of scribes. While it is never easy for journalists to write objectively when someone from their  is assassinated, and a bit of hyperbole is quite natural in extolling the virtues of the person killed, pushing personal, political, professional and ideological agendas on the back of an unconscionable murder doesn’t do any service to the memory of the slain journalist — even less so when their hysterics are the result of half-truths and incomplete facts. I cannot say Shujaat was a friend, but we ran into each other many times and had our share of run-ins at seminars and conferences, both in India and abroad. Despite our serious disagreements and differences, it goes to Shujaat’s credit that he never became disagreeable simply because we didn’t agree with each other. Unlike most other journalists who are extremely prickly when their style of journalism is questioned, Shujaat was someone who wouldn’t make an issue of it. He would try to explain where he was coming from — but wouldn’t press the issue, much less try to convert his interlocutor to accept what he was saying. Perhaps we sometimes do become unfair and insensitive towards journalists reporting from conflict zones. The fact is, we simply don’t face the sort of professional and personal pressures that confront people located on a ground zero of conflict. While it is quite easy for us to theorise and pontificate on the problems with reportage from a virtual war zone, the practical reality of reporting from such an area is something else. Reporters who parachute into a conflict area don’t have it easy — but even they don’t face the sort of difficulties faced by journalists who live the conflict. However, there is a flip side to this argument, about people reporting from ground zero and those analysing developments from a comfortable distance. The latter do not suffer the exigencies of navigating through the minefield of a dirty war, one in which no one is sure who is the enemy and who is the friend; they can therefore think of ""problems"" and ""solutions"" which those in the thick of things don’t have the luxury of thinking out. Tragic as Shujaat’s death is, its implications will be far-reaching. The first is, of course, that his brutal murder is a sign, if one was needed, that the situation in Kashmir is continuing to deteriorate. Any temporary truce or calm is just that. Worse is still to come. Cocky confidence and spin doctoring by government spokespersons, coupled with the hubris of politicians that the security forces are well-placed and well-equipped to prevent the situation spiraling out of control, is either willful deception — or worse, delusion. There is a new wave of terrorism sweeping Kashmir. It comprises not just well-trained jihadist terrorists supported and sponsored by Pakistan, but also young Kashmiri boys and men who, after a fashion or trend, have decided to join the ranks of militants. While one part of this terrorism is directed from across the border, another part of it is chaotic, diffused, almost gang-land-type violence in which a band of guys take it upon themselves to ""make their bones"" and establish themselves as men of consequence. The fact that Shujaat’s assassins would have studied his routine, and managed to carry out their grisly task in a high-security zone, were savvy enough to pick the right time — iftaar — to strike (it is a time when the Ramzan fast is broken and there is a tendency to relax) suggests a level of planning and execution that needs to be taken seriously. But whether this brutal killing was carried out by guided terrorists for some strategic objective or messaging, or by some random bunch ""making their bones"", is still not entirely clear. The ceasefire, both inside Kashmir and along the Line of Control, has been a miserable failure. The ceasefire ploy was a roll of dice — not a well-thought-out and well-planned initiative to kick-start a reconciliation process. It was almost as though the government (both state and central) had reached the end of their imagination and decided to do something, anything, to break the logjam. But what they have ended up doing is releasing all the pressure that was built by the security forces after paying a heavy price in men and material. People on the ground claim that the ""ceasefire"" played into the hands of the terrorists and ended up empowering them. The third implication is that the middle ground in Kashmir is shrinking at an alarming rate. It is going to become increasingly difficult for journalists to report freely from the terrorism-affected state. In a sense, we are slipping back to the early 1990s when newspapers used to publish advertisements of people disassociating from the Indian state and newsmen clarified their positions, lest they be targeted. Shujaat’s killing is a sign that, in some ways, things are even worse than what they were in the 1990s. In all the blood that was spilled during the 1990s and early 2000s, journalists were, by and large, left unmolested. They faced enormous pressures from both terrorists and the security forces, but apart from one or two cases, the journalist community lived to tell the tale. This could be changing with Shujaat’s killing. Middle-of-the-road journalism could start becoming a thing of the past. Worse, anyone who tries to bring a semblance of normalcy in Kashmir could become fair game. In other words, the message — no one is safe anymore. For journalists, the danger is increasing also because unlike the 1990s, when everyone wanted to be on their right side in order to get their message out in the public domain, today, technology has made journalists redundant insofar as narrative-building or messaging is concerned. The ungoverned spaces on the internet have enabled terrorists to communicate virtually in real time and without the messenger (in the old days, the media organisation) editing or watering down their message. This means that the restraint shown in the past — even if you disagreed with a media outfit or journalist, you did nothing, lest it turned the rest of the media tribe against you — no longer applies. The media is now a soft target which gets maximum bang for a terrorist's buck, without now having to suffer the damage caused by a hostile media. The danger is even greater for journalists who go beyond the professional call of duty and dabble in peace-making by playing mediator or even messenger. In the case of Shujaat, there are some reports that he might have been targeted because he was trying to play mediator and push ahead with a nebulous peace process. If so, then his activities clearly riled some people who had no use for any peace process. Kashmir today is on the edge of the abyss, once again. Militancy is making a comeback and it isn’t limited to just local youth joining terrorist ranks. Older groups active in the 1990s and early 2000s are reviving. The choice before the government in Srinagar and New Delhi is that they can end their ambivalence and prevarication and do everything necessary to break the ecosystem that supports terrorism and separatism in Kashmir. Or, they can keep fiddling around, skirting the tough issues, let the situation deteriorate to a point that the water crosses their head and then take the tough decisions which they're avoiding today. The only problem with the latter option is that the government will have to exert far more later than they will have to now. But the way the Indian political system works, we won't act indeed until our head is under water.  ",2018-06-15,"Journalist killed,Militancy in kashmir,Kashmir,Shujaat  bukhari",Shujaat Bukhari's killing shows Kashmiri journalists may not live to tell their tale,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/shujaat-bukhari-kashmir-assassination-kashmiri-journalists-bjp-pdp-militancy-burhan-wani/story/1/24912.html
333,Pathikrit Sanyal,"While the right-wing group called Hindu Sena (Hindu Army) was busy   Donald Trump’s 72nd birthday in New Delhi — with a “havan”, cake and selfies alongside a larger-than-life poster of the US President — two other notorious Hindu-right groups, the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), have been classified as ""militant religious organisations"" by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), a civilian foreign intelligence service of the United States federal government. According to a new   in  , as per latest updates made to the “World Factbook”, an annual encyclopaedic publication of the CIA that “  information on the history, people, government, economy, energy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues for 267 world entities,” the two organisations have been named as ""militant religious outfits"" under the tag “Political pressure groups and leaders”. They are not the only ones, however, that have received such earnest recognition. The All Parties Hurriyat Conference led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq in Kashmir has been labelled as a “separatist group”. The former Rajya Sabha MP Moulana Mehmood Madani-led Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind has been labelled as a “religious organisation”. And the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has been tagged as a “nationalist organisation”. And while the RSS’s categorisation can be debated (extensively), the Bajrang Dal and the VHP being called “militant” is a welcome step in identifying the menace hardline right-wing groups like them create in India. Of course, neither of them is particularly happy about this classification. Speaking to  , Manoj Verma, the national convenor of the Bajrang Dal said: “This came to our notice a few days ago. We are consulting experts and seeking legal advice to counter this.” Another Bajrang Dal leader added: “Why would any intelligence agency cite our organisations as being ‘militant’. Who gave them the right? We have international branches as well but we’ve never troubled anyone. We are nationalists. We will see what can be done to get this right.” Their indignation, however, is bluntly contradicted by their actions. Barely 48 hours ago, on June 12, members of the VHP   a 10x11 foot steel gate installed at the western entrance of the Taj Mahal by the Archaeological Survey of India, claiming it allegedly blocked access to the Siddheshwar Mahadev temple. Both the VHP and the Bajrang Dal often spout toxic anti-Muslim rhetoric and have been known to legitimise the “Love Jihad” bogey — where Muslim men supposedly conspire to seduce, marry and convert Hindu women to strengthen their numbers in India. The VHP, according to   employs a network of spies who work as restaurant employees across Western UP whose sole purpose is apparently to keep an eye out for “suspicious” (read interreligious) couples. The Bajrang Dal, in fact, even organised an   to secretly train its workers and members to use arms; to ""protect"" Hindus, of course. Odd, for a group that claims it is not “militant”. The VHP’s militancy has been a core feature of its ideology. One has only to see what VHP leader Pravin Togadia   in the wake of the BJP’s victory in the 2002 post-riot elections in Gujarat: “All Hindutva opponents will get the death sentence, and we will leave this to the people to carry out.” And while this is not the first time a non-Indian government organisation has similarly classified such groups — the Bajrang Dal has apparently been previously described as “ ” by the US State Department’s annual reports on International Religious Freedom because of assaults on religious minorities — this move by the CIA is a welcome reminder to a government that turns a blind eye towards such groups and the violence they perpetrate in the name of Hindutva. It is only fitting that just two days after former CIA Director   called Donald Trump ""unstable, erratic and thin-skinned,"" groups that have   the US President’s Islamophobic tendencies have been brought to their own reckoning, at least in the eyes of the world outside India’s borders.",2018-06-14,"Militant groups,Bajrang Dal,Vishwa Hindu Parishad,CIA","CIA calls Bajrang Dal and VHP 'militant religious organisations', but who's listening?",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/cia-world-factbook-bajrang-dal-vishwa-hindu-parishad-rss-hindutva-militant-outfits/story/1/24874.html
334,Mayuresh Ganapatye,"This year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) correctly predicted the arrival of the monsoon in Mumbai. But the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) didn't seem to be ready for the rains despite its tall claims about how Mumbaikars won't be at the receiving end of any kind of flood-like situation. The municipal body also went on to claim that it has identified more than 200 flooding spots across the city and worked on 120. But all these statistics, tall claims — along with the hopes of Mumbaikars — were shattered as soon as the first showers hit the city. While reporting on the BMC’s monsoon preparedness, I happened to visit the top four flooding spots in Mumbai. This time, the BJP has installed large machines which will help it fetch water from these areas. One such spot is Dadar's Hindmata. Here, the BMC has installed three to four high-power pump machines. The municipal body has also tried to guard the area and its own claims by starting a flood control room at Hindmata. But every one of their plans got washed away with the first few spells of showers alone as the entire vicinity started filling up after just 30 minutes of rains. The plight of Mumbaikars residing in Sion’s Gandhi Market was no different. Flooding in the area affects Mumbaikars in one of the worst ways possible since it completely blocks the highway connecting Mumbai to Navi Mumbai — a route taken by lakhs of commuters Another area in Sion that faced the blow of monsoon and the BMC’s claims was near the famous Gurukripa Restaurant. Geographically, these spots fall under the “low-lying areas of Mumbai”. But the BMC can't get away with the fact that there has been absolutely no improvement in controlling the floods except in parts of the Elphinstone Road area. Despite its blatant lies about monsoon preparedness, the BMC claims that the reason behind the frequent incidents of flooding is Mumbai's Geographical location — the municipal body claims that it is a coastal city and thus prone to flooding. But the BMC conveniently refrains from addressing the different tactics employed by these cities to tackle flooding. Despite thousands of crores of public money being spent on desiliting nullas, repairing roads and cleaning drainage, why does flooding occur year after year? If Mumbaikars (who are the actual taxpayers) question the BMC about where their money is going, what is wrong? What do we do with the BMC's claims? In September 2017, Elphinstone Road had become the talk of the town after the  , who lost his life after falling into an open manhole. Therefore, this year, the BMC urged all its ward officials to ensure that the manholes are covered. However, a three-year-old boy lost his life after slipping into an open drain in Mumbai's Cheeta Camp area. So, who is responsible for his death? I declare to the BMC that it should urge Mumbaikars to pay for their own deaths for that's what citizens have been doing in the name of paying taxes. The BMC undoubtedly needs better technology and planning. More importantly, it needs to care about the people of Mumbai. How can bullet trains, underground Metros, monorails and hyperloop transport services be a priority for the BMC and the government when they fail to provide basic civic amenities to Mumbaikars? The holders of plum positions are collecting taxes from the civic society members and selling them suffering and death in return. The BMC can develop this city if only it values the lives of its people. Without this, citizens will continue paying for their own demise!",2018-06-14,"Mumbai Floods,Mumbai,BMC",Should Mumbaikars stop paying BMC for their death?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mumbaikars-killed-bmc-death-by-manholes-india-flooding-mumbai/story/1/24873.html
335,Shantanu Mukharji,"Dhaka is steadily hotting up with hectic political activities as the  draw nearer. Elections will be held either end of this year or early next year. The main Opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which was lying dormant and dysfunctional till late, has suddenly embarked upon a flurry of belligerent political activities and appears to be getting direction from some powerful lobby belonging to the hostile quarters against the prime minister. The BNP was in political hibernation until recently as its party supremo, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, is in prison and believed to have suffred a mild stroke recently rendering her politically irrelevant in the context of election campaigning. As is common knowledge, Khaleda Zia is facing serious graft charges and continues to be prosecuted, notwithstanding the fact that her party has engaged a high-profile British lawyer to contest the case on her behalf. What appears significant, however, is the BNP's overtures to India for support and “guidance”. The BNP is still undecided if it would at all contest the elections or not. To woo India, the BNP sent a three-member delegation to India last week under the leadership of former commerce minister,  Amir Khosru M Chowdhury, and two other senior party functionaries. During their New Delhi stay, they held long parleys with several think tanks, including the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), Observer Research Foundation (ORF) and Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF). The visiting BNP team vehemently criticised the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government for their alleged role in exterminating their political adversaries in the name of nabbing drug traffickers who are involved in smuggling of drugs from across the border, especially from Myanmar, drawing all-round condemnation from various human rights groups. The BNP delegation also tried to highlight the alleged corruption cases involving Hasina and her cohorts on various counts. Their tenor, during the interactions, was not bereft of any assertions and instead, was business like and to the point. Essentially, they wanted India to hold BNP’s hand, extending support to it during the elections. Going by the theory of elimination, it can be safely assumed that Pakistan will extend all-out support to the BNP, its long-time friend, using every possible means to subvert Hasina and her regime. However, the Indian experts pointedly told the BNP delegation about their party's opportunistic politics — when out of power, it tries to warm up to India but once in power, it openly supports anti-India and pro-Pakistani forces, alarmingly harbouring multiple Indian insurgents belonging to the Northeast. Now, in a desperate bid to come back to power, the BNP hinged on several promises in an apparent bid to elicit support. Yet, judging by the party’s past performance vis-a-vis India, the promises did not cut much ice during the interactions. Back in Dhaka, ongoing encounters and cross-firing incidents are giving much ammunition to the BNP amid credible reports that if the Hasina government does not release Khaleda Zia before Eid, that is in a couple of days, the BNP would resort to a massive agitation subsequently galvanising a mass movement. But if she is out of prison, Khaleda Zia is expected to use all her charisma leading the movement from the front. Once in the electoral fray, the BNP will prove to be a formidable Opposition causing serious challenge to the government in power. Therefore, Hasina needs to tread with caution to deal with the latest developments and any minor lapse of judgement or calculation, might cause a dent. One must always remember that the BNP, while in power, had the right wing anti-India and pro-Pakistan Islamic fundamentalist party (the Jamaat-e-Islami) as its ally and partner in governance which had helped the latter to consolidate its grassroots cadres, abetting radical forces to foment terror as seen in the deadly cases in the past two years. Meanwhile, recent reports trickling in about the killings of a couple of liberals indicate that the extremist forces may have bounced back and resorted to a renewed killing spree targeting liberals and minority communities. This can prove catastrophic if the BNP is out on the streets, especially from the electoral point of view. For the Awami League government, to be confident on part is alright, but overconfidence in dealing with the critical issues could prove costly.",2018-06-14,"India,Awami League,Bnp,Bangladesh elections",How the election heat in neighbouring Bangladesh is seeping into India,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bangladesh-general-election-bnp-awami-league-khaleda-zia-sheikh-hasina-india-pakistan/story/1/24868.html
336,Zeeshan Ali,"Thousands thronged to pay tribute to Razan al-Najjar, 20, as her mortal remains were buried. She was an intrepid medic who was shot dead by Israeli forces while she was trying to save lives. She ran towards the Gaza fence, undaunted, to help an injured protester when bullets from Israeli snipers pierced her flesh. Even as an identifiable healthcare professional and non-combatant, she was fatally shot. According to Norman Finkelstein, a noted political scientist, she was assassinated again in  . Reporter Herbert Buchsbaum distorted her earlier interviews, turning her devotion to aid the wounded and be a shield into “avowal of a terrorist cause”. What beguiles intellect and even plain empathy was further was her refusal to accept imprisonment being equated with waging a war. At least 121 Palestinians have been killed and 10,000 others injured by Israeli troops, as protests continued along the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Notwithstanding sporadic inflections of aggression, there has been relative mundanity since the 2014 crisis. But the escalations have crossed the red line this time. On May 14, the current bout of protests and violence witnessed 60 bodies being felled by the Israeli bullets. More than 40,000 people have congregated to protest the transposition of the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a city at the epicentre of the Palestine-Israel conflict. The Great Return March, as it was monikered, was aimed to draw attention to the 11-year blockade of Gaza by Israel. It was supposed to be the epilogue of the seven-week long demonstration at the Gaza Strip border fence. Palestinians commemorate May 15 as the Nakba day or the day of Catastrophe. The day marks the exodus of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israel war. The Nakba has its genesis in the Arab-Israeli war which began on May 15, 1948. A day earlier, Israel had declared Independence as Mandate Palestine and with it the British Control of Palestine came to an end. Most of the Arabs inhabiting the area became foreign to their own lands and were expelled by Israeli forces. Several thousands were displaced again by the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Today, some five million Palestinians inhabit pockets of Jordan, the Gaza Strip, West Bank, Syria, Lebanon, and East Jerusalem as registered UN refugees. Israel says its actions are necessary to defend its borders, accusing Hamas of encouraging thousands of Palestinians to break through the border and attack Israelis. Unlike previous occasions like Operation Protective Edge in 2014, it does not have the pretext of rockets being fired by Hamas on this occasion. Even if a few people transgressed and crossed the fence, they could have been apprehended non-violently and returned. Several countries have condemned the Israeli havoc that has been wreaked on defenceless civilians and Israel is facing growing international calls for an independent investigation into live firing during the civilian protests. However, it has not being adequately decried or demonised by popular media channels. Last week, the United States voted against a Kuwait-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution exhorting the protection of Palestinian civilians. It was favoured by ten countries, including Russia and France. The Kuwait-sponsored draft called for an expeditious stop on “the use of any excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force” by Israeli. It also condemned the firing of rockets from the Gaza Strip at Israeli civilian areas. The Islamic Jihad and Hamas groups have since taken responsibility for such aggression as retaliation to Israeli offensive. US had created a huge hue and cry over the omission of Hamas’ name in the draft. Washington DC characteristically drafted its own counter resolution demanding that Hamas and other Palestinian groups to cease provocation while being absolutely quiet on Israeli use of force on Palestinian civilians. Embarrassingly for US, the only country to vote in favour of its resolution was US itself, with 11 countries including Britain abstaining from the vote and three rejecting it downright. The seat of General Assembly will be the next arena for debate. Interestingly, the 193-member body does not suffer from the tyrannies of veto power like the Security Council. Approximately 7,50,000 Palestinians displaced in the protests, including the descendents of the originally displaced families, have claimed the right to return to their home which they were forced to abdicate. Currently, their houses are located inside Israeli land. None of the displaced persons were allowed to return to the their homes or communities and the subsequent war of 1967 only bolstered the ranks of homeless refugees. Palestinian refugees’ right to return to their homes is well established in international law. The UN General Assembly Resolution 194 (III) Of December 1948 with UNSC Res 242 and 338 have been regularly evidenced as the basis for such inalienable rights. The rights outlined in these resolutions are inextricably espoused in international covenants on human rights and refugee law. Since 1948, Israel does not recognise Palestinian refugees’ right to return. It is argued that if Israel agreed to repatriation of Palestinian refugees then it would have to relinquish the land that it seized during the1948 War. If they are allowed to return to their homes, the Jewish population of the area would become the minority. Thus, the Israeli stance stems from the fear of turning Israel into a bi-national state with a Jewish minority. The United States has acted like a complaisant ally to Israel but has refrained from officially taking a stand against the Right of Return of Palestinians. However, US officials, much like Nikki Haley (current US Ambassador to UN) have pushed Palestinians to demit the right of return and turned the discourse into a political rhetoric than a humanitarian appeal. In December, US President Donald Trump infuriated Palestinians by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The US Embassy was moved there from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May as the inevitable and natural development and has been noted for a possible cause for escalation of demonstrations by leaders like French president Emmanuel Macron. The conflagration on the border fence at Gaza is much more than a security defence. It is blatant genocide and unapologetic massacre of civilians. The juxtaposed broadcasts of Israeli and US officials celebrating the embassy opening in Jerusalem with 40,000 Palestinians embroiled in a virulent protest at the Gaza put the suffering of others into a new paradigm. According to noted political scientist and Israeli scholar, Baruch Kimmerling, “Gaza is the largest concentration camp ever to exist”.The Israeli blockade is active in the north and the east; Mediterranean waters lie to the west and are devoid of ports. Finally, Egypt blocks the south where it is fighting its own battle against extremists in Sinai. The rubble and ruins of the 2014 crisis are yet to be rehabilitated. Meanwhile, Palestinians do not even have a currency to transact in. US have slashed its contribution for UNWRA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees and their descendants. Nearly one million people are dependent on UNRWA for survival in Gaza. Nearly 50 percent workforce suffers the burden of unemployment. The gradual and seemingly more uninflammatory and palatable version of “Auschwitz”, where the Israeli blockade has not only imprisoned the native Palestinians but where Israel is tightening its vice-like grip to a choking point. Nearly two million Gazans, with more than half of them children, consume water that is reportedly 97 per cent contaminated. This unseen violence of penury and deprivation has already made the Gaza strip unlivable and unsurvivable. The ever increasing population is circumscribed in continuously diminishing space with plummeting living index, including water et al. The only option for survival is to scratch, claw and haul oneself out of the concentration camp. It's not befuddling to assume many would risk death by scampering for an escape from the incarceration. No one would have denied the same sacrosanct right to life and survival to the prisoners at Auschwitz or Dachau. Not even the most militant of Zionists or even Benjamin Netanyahu himself would dare make such a claim. On the contrary, Israel is not even flapping an eyelid at the prospect of being pulled into the International Criminal Court on accounts of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity with several of the top brass, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vehemently standing in defense of its inhuman perpetrations. They assert the country’s right to defend its borders and territorial integrity as per the operation of international law. Megalomaniacal and mephistophelean dictators always pander to others of their own ilk. The mollycoddling of the empowered by the ones with still more power feeds off the disempowered. The unstatesman-like showmen of the US, Israel, Russia and even India have more in common than there geographical incongruity or culture diversity would suggest. Unfortunately, the popular wisdom seems to be succumbing to such idiosyncratic explanations and systematic political idiom. Often the dangers of oppression by the gun-toting phalanx do not warrant from the perceived actions of the body of people across the fence but from the impassioned exhortation by the body of people behind it. The most nefarious though is the body of people on the sides either defending it or minting media currency by debating it as a spectacle. The abovementioned pieces of reckless and unethical journalistic coverage and even popular infractions need to be scrutinised and stamped out. Media and the general onlookers need to hold the guilty accountable and bring them to light of justice and fairness. The past two-and-half decades of peaceful negotiations and diplomacy has prevented an all out war but has provided disproportionate suffering and loss of life to the Palestinians. However, with disunited leadership of West Bank and Gaza, the Arabian countries seem to be more amenable to a solution which would be detrimental to Palestinian aspirations and struggle. For Saudi Arabia and co., Iran seems to be a greater worry than the horrors in Palestine. With America as the interlocutor under the guidance of Donald Trump the signs may become ripe for a third Intifada. The battered bodies of Palestinians may resurrect with the spirit of revolt even though it may terminate with a bloody end. The seemingly interminable ordeal in Gaza has these episodic spikes. It turns a few heads and puts few more fingers to the keyboard, including mine. Words are spouted and rebukes are launched. When the dust settles the bodies (or whatever is left of them) are buried and the war just goes on. Debate and spiel about the legitimate quantum of force and the international political law when ensconcing Gaza is an outrage to the fundamental and oft pronounced and promoted Universal human rights of millions of Gazans! If the international community is serious about conflict resolution and establishing lasting peace or even some form of détente, it must recognise the Palestinians’ unassailable right of return and punish the perpetrators of such inhuman hostilities and massacre.

337,Romita Datta,"Three ministers lost their posts and three heavyweight ministers were stripped off their portfolios recently. The reason: they were not active enough to help Mamata Banerjee have an Opposition-free three-tier panchayat. Whereas ministers, who fulfiled her expectations, were awarded additional responsibilities in terms of additional departments. This has been more or less the custom and convention of Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet. The ministers shown the boot were James Kujur, in-charge of the tribal welfare department, and Chudamoni Mahato, handling the backward classes welfare department. Mahato, from Gopiballavpur constituency in Jhargram, was held responsible for helping the saffron party increase its vote share in tribal areas. The BJP, for the first time, increased its vote share in Jhargram to 42 per cent as against 48 per cent of the Trinamool Congress. For the first time, the party wrested village council seats in west Midnapore and Purulia, an area which had erstwhile been the committed vote-bank of the Left before Trinamool won the support and sympathy of the tribals in 2011. It needs no guessing how the change happened. The Maoist movement in Lalgarh, the camaraderie between the Trinamool Congress leaders and the people, who were the frontal face of the movement — all were factors that helped Trinamool change the tide. To ensure the change was permanent and everlasting, Banerjee got into the root problem as to why the Left lost and consequently, the Maoists gained confidence of the tribals. She showered the backward areas with social welfare schemes and subsidised ration. Things went well for the first term, but what Banerjee failed to understand was that change is the only constant in life. It was not just enough for the tribals to be fed. They wanted work, employment, accessibility to the doles the government promised and, above all, the dignity of living. “While we toiled to get the benefits of housing, toilet, water and other facilities, our leaders amassed wealth and property,” said Dinu Soren of Jhargram. While discontent brewed among the tribals against their leaders, the party in power remained oblivious to their demands. Banerjee was rattled as to why her policies failed in the tribal belt, despite having toured Jangalmahal areas so extensively. She, in the end, failed to understand the tribals. So now, the easiest way to find a way out of the problem was to find a scapegoat. And she found one in Chudamoni Mahato, the minister in charge of the backward classes welfare department. Mahato, being close to Mukul Roy, the Trinamool Congress rebel who joined the BJP last November, perfectly fitted the bill. Rumours of sabotage were in the air, and it was convenient for the ruling party to circulate the rumours rather than accept its mistakes. The same thing happened with Kujur from Alipurduar, another area which was beginning to show saffron shoots. Kujur was minister of tribal welfare, so naturally, he became the obvious target for the growing grievances of the tribals against the distribution of doles and welfare largesse. A large section of tribals of the Jalpaiguri-Alipurduar area in 2014 had supported the BJP and having observed the trend, the Trinamool Congress was sitting on it, hoping this too shall pass by winning over a section of the Adivasis with power, position and obviously money. This made the divide wider, far more obvious, resulting in the growth of the BJP in the areas. Banerjee has now kept the tribal welfare department with her, and given the backward classes welfare department to Rajiv Banerjee. It’s a demotion for him, a punishment for allowing an independent candidate win a zilla parishad seat. Meanwhile, two veteran Trinamool Congress leaders have lost their prestigious departments. Panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee and Kolkata mayor Sovon Chatterjee, who held three departments under him, were blamed for being inactive during the panchayat polls.

338,Harsha Kakar,"Mehbooba Mufti has throughout her tenure attempted to be an optimist, at times even utopian. She has regularly called for the youth to shun violence, has announced that guns and stones are not an answer, sought to lodge FIRs against the army for retaliating against stone pelters and even forgiven those indulging in violence. All in the belief that Kashmiri youth would respond to her requests of curtailing violence and the valley would rise to its earlier pristine glory. Her soft approach has been contrary to the hard one adopted by the centre and security forces. Simultaneously, she had requested for a  , especially during the period of Ramzan. The government responded with NICO (Non-initiation of Combat Operations) and once implemented, she appealed to Pakistan and militant groups to follow suit. As expected, none responded. The LeT officially rebutted her offer. She has attempted to appease masses by appealing as a state against the removal of Article 35A, supported the Valley by ordering a state crime branch probe into the  on religious grounds and has even been regularly requesting the Hurriyat to join peace talks. All her actions seem to be revolving around the valley. She has tended to ignore other parts of the state, seeking to bring peace to the Valley. Her comments appear to present a picture that she has the interests of the Valley and its youth in her heart. Her calls for talks with Pakistan have been ignored by the centre as the government continues to blame Pakistan for fermenting violence in the valley. She has at times blamed Pakistan for the casualties along the borders, while at times she has adopted the Hurriyat line of talks to resolve Kashmir. Her regular demands for initiating talks with Pak have even had her dubbed as an anti-national. Her basic fault remains in her belief that violence would reduce if security forces limit their actions. It is this belief which has pushed her into seeking a ceasefire. NICO has resulted in the army stopping cordon and search operations, launching operations against local militants in built up areas unless attacked, thus reducing stone pelting. Since no local militants were slain, there were no burials, hence lesser would join militancy. However, all this is a temporary measure. Local militants would soon display their colours and compel the army to relaunch operations. It is time she and her government accept ground realities and act, failing which militancy, which has reduced in tempo would rebound. The reality, especially as it concerns the valley is lack of political outreach. While she has been making her appeals, her political outreach essential to win the trust of the population, has been missing. Most of her elected MLAs have rarely ventured into their constituencies to spread her word, solely fearing security concerns. Thus, governance and alongside it, her calls for shunning violence, have had almost no impact across the region. She has simultaneously made no effort to reduce the influence of the Hurriyat, which allegedly controls violence in the Valley based on their hawala funds and direct instructions from Pakistan. They have ignored her appeals and even refused to respond to her. When   raised his voice against the Hurriyat, the video of which went viral, she should have exploited the same politically, which she failed to do, allowing the Hurriyat to regain the initiative by releasing the second video, in which he apologised for his outburst. It was only Jatinder Singh of the BJP, who exploited it. Her utopian belief may have worked had the Valley not been radicalised, violence paid for by hawala funds and the youth had opportunities to release their pent-up energy in other spheres. Her blaming and accusing security forces for excessive force, by lodging FIRs has only angered the nation, though may appease the locals. The reality is that security forces are in the region for a purpose. They neither seek to target locals nor operate against them. When challenged or threated they would respond. Their task is to target militants, locals or Pak launched. In the process, those seeking to distract them, leading to own casualties, would become casualties. She is aware of the multiple social media groups, created and supported by anti-national elements, which incite the public to move into encounter sites, desiring forces retaliate. It is these casualties, either of local militants or stone-pelters killed, which breed more militants. She has refused to accept that it is glorification of eliminated militants which has led to more youth joining militant ranks. The chants during the burial, firing of small arms and large crowds, with words of praise by over ground workers and Hurriyat representatives, incite the crowds and draws in recruits into militancy. This has been proved by the recent study conducted by her own police. Logically, she should have stopped family burials for eliminated local militants, but it would impact vote banks, as also initially lead to more violence, hence has been continued. The BJP-PDP combine in Jammu and Kashmir, is possibly a government of convenience as both parties represent different vastly different regions of the state. While the PDP has maximum seats from the Valley, the BJP has them from Jammu. Both are desperately seeking to hold onto their vote banks and hence have failed to come together to find common ground in the state. Even the surrender policy is held up due to variations in view. In the bargain, both regions have suffered and neither has trusted the coalition. It is to her credit that despite all shortcomings of the coalition, they have held together. She has held the fort and attempted to appease the population during the uprising post the elimination of Burhan Wani. Any other weak-hearted chief minister would have resigned, to gain public sympathy, but she held forth. The government at the Centre has been providing every assistance in every manner, yet on ground, visible change is missing. There is still time. Outreach by the government, positive development, limiting the influence of the Hurriyat and renewed investigation by the NIA and ED, could change the structure in the Valley. She can herald this change, but then must climb down from her utopian heights and take the bull by the horns. If she does not act, this combination may not return in the next elections.  ",2018-06-13,"Hurriyat,Ramzan ceasefire,Kashmir,Mehbooba Mufti",Has Mehbooba Mufti’s outreach yielded any positive results in Kashmir?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mehbooba-mufti-kashmir-ceasefire-violation-ramzan-loc-pakistan-hurriyat/story/1/24843.html
339,Amarnath K Menon,"Telangana is literally leaving no stone unturned, even soil too, in wooing the state’s farmers. Going way beyond handing out the cash grant — Rs 4,000 an acre for each farming season — as investment support under the novel Rythu Bandhu scheme, the state is enlarging the area to be provided the critical input of water. “We are doing wonders in irrigation and scripting history having provided water to 13.57 lakh acres in the just concluded yasangi (rabi) season,” exults the Irrigation minister T Harish Rao, adding, “Ensuring water availability to the last acre is our objective.” He says the scientific management of water resources has increased the irrigation facility. “Normally one TMCft of water will meet the needs of 8,000 acres. By introducing the on-and-off technology we checked wastage to ensure optimal utilisation and increase crop production significantly.” In fact, water released through the Nagarjunasagar Left Bank Canal was used to irrigate 11,796 acres with one TMCft of water to make it the most intensively irrigated area ever in the state. However, the highest acreage (13,021 acres) per one TMCft was achieved in the areas irrigated by Nizamsagar. In the erstwhile undivided Andhra Pradesh, the maximum area irrigated was only 7,000 acres with one TMCft establishing that Telangana has been able to use water optimally. The TRS government has provided new irrigation facility to 10,00,000 acres in four years while the earlier Congress government could provide water to only 5.70 lakh acres in its 10-year rule between 2004 and 2014, claims Harish Rao. Since inception, Telangana has strived to achieve the best state in irrigation tag. The ongoing Mission Kakatiya which has helped revive water bodies and the gigantic Kaleshwaram project are poised to be the game changers in irrigation for the state. “CM K Chandrashekar Rao’s vision for a green Telangana, coupled with the untiring efforts of the irrigation department, has shown the country how available water resources can be effectively utilised,” said Harish Rao at a seminar on ""Four years of progress in state and management of water from irrigation projects"" in Hyderabad on June 7. Water management practices adopted and popularised by the state irrigation department have helped farmers to enhance crop yield from 40 to 45 bags an acre to the 50–55 bags an acre range. With the twin goal of utilising its entire share of 954 TMCft of Godavari waters and securing its share from the Krishna river, the state is optimistic about completing irrigation projects on time and modernising old ones. It is already seeking Rs 675 crore under the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Projects (DRIP) scheme to rehabilitate 34 dams, as well as the financial support of the central government under its incentive scheme to modernise 28 irrigation utilities. The usually divergent weather forecasters concur on Telangana receiving more than its normal share of the monsoon rains this year, enabling greater storage in watersheds and plentiful for farmers. The TRS is not banking on this alone. The CM is planning to embark on a rythu yatra after Independence Day to select villages to interact with farmers to impress upon them that his government is truly Rythu Bandhu (farmer’s friend). KCR has already launched several pro-farmer initiatives including the Rs 5 lakh free life insurance scheme, in association with the Life Insurance Corporation of India, covering 58,00,000 farmers. Describing it as “the single greatest thing I have done in my life”, KCR pointed out “the life of a farmer is like playing a game of snakes and ladders. Many risks have to be overcome and we have the challenge to ensure that farmers emerge as winners.” (Courtesy of  )",2018-06-11,"Assembly polls 2019,Telangana,TRS,K chandrashekar rao","Ahead of 2019 Assembly polls, how K Chandrashekar Rao plans to woo farmers in Telangana",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/k-chandrashekar-rao-trs-telangana-assembly-polls-2019/story/1/24786.html
340,Rajeev Dhavan,"The issue of “migrants” and “citizenship"" is a matter of concern for the Northeastern states who fear flooding of immigrants from India’s neighbours: Bangladesh and Myanmar. Having resolved Indian citizenship on the basis of birth (jus soli), descent (jus sanguinis), naturalisation (jus naturalis) or registration, the Constitution and the Citizenship Act 1955 dealt with the then vexed issue of Pakistani migrants in the aftermath of Partition. In 1985, as a consequence of the Bangladesh war and the Assam Accord, Citizenship Act got a new provision (Section 6A) whereby those who were ordinarily resident on January 1, 1966, and on the electoral roll for the 1967 elections were deemed citizens. Those who came between January 1, 1966 and March 25, 1971 would need to have their status determined by tribunals under the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act 1983. In the Sonowal case (2005-07) this procedure, which was peculiar to Assam, was abolished. In 2005, 88,770 cases were pending and 12,848 migrants were declared illegal. The Governor’s report showed an excessive influx of Bangladeshis playing on the xenophobia of the Northeast states. Indian citizenship laws came to be more relaxed in favour of Overseas Citizens of India (OCI’s) from 2004 to 2015. In 2003 and 2005, a kind of dual citizenship was offered to OCI’s in 16 countries excluding, Pakistan and Bangladesh. India was claiming links with all ""Indians"" abroad as part of a Greater India policy. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 tried to extend this process in ways that were not above reproach and with and consequences which threatened to undermine the Bill’s future. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill of 2016 proposed to make particular minorities who entered into India without valid travel documents or whose documents had expired to become eligible to apply for citizenship. They could not apply under the registration provisions (Section 5) or the naturalisation provisions which required a 12-year residency (Section 6). As a step back, OCI’s could lose their status if they acted contrary to the Citizenship Act or any other law giving the government a pick and choose power. The technique used by the Bill of 2016 peculiarly granted legal migration status to “minority communities, namely Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.” The meaning is clear in the sub-texts. The central government would exempt these “minorities” from the provisions of the Foreigners Act 1946 and Passport Act of 1920. Importantly, these five minorities do not have to be persecuted “refugees”. They just have to show that they belong to these minorities. Although the mantle stretches to Buddhists, Christians and Parsis, that is simply a front — an attempt to make a symbolic statement about the Muslim countries on India’s borders and to stand up for Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists. Certainly, the Afghan Sikhs have had a problem getting citizenship. But, in the main, this is a Hindutva programme in which India (as a de facto Hindu state) is playing the role of protector of the Hindus in the neighbourhood states and, through OCI, worldwide. In case Muslims or others fall under the OCI category, under the Bill of 2016 they can be removed. There is a dual target. The first is against the States of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh — all Muslim states. The indictment is that these states do not treat minorities well. Coming as it does from a possible parliamentary statute, this indictment is heavy. Of course, this could lead to the counter-argument that India does not treat its minorities well either. But as far as these states are concerned the other persecuted minorities are ignored such as the Ahmadiyyas or Bohras in Pakistan. If Iran were to be included, what about the Bahais? If China were included, Buddhists would be included as a minority as, indeed, the Muslim Uighurs. But India does not want to play the diplomatic odds with either Iran or China. The former is a supplier of oil; and the latter too powerful. Indeed, when the Chinese delegation came to India, care was taken to curtail Uighur protests. If anyone deserves protection, it is surely the Muslim Rohingyas from the Rakhine State in Myanmar. In 1982, the Myanmar citizenship law was pointedly racist to exclude the Muslim Rohingyas. After the 2012 riots and murders around Sittwe, the Rohingyas suffer acute persecution. But, at present, the BJP led government does not care about the Muslims and has taken a stance in the Supreme Court of India which is viciously negative. Suu Kyi’s NLD is unlikely to protect Rohingyas. The second aspect of the Bill is the window dressing of adding Christians and Parsis. This government does not really care about the Christians and surmises that the Parsis can take care of themselves. The upshot is necessarily communal. Why was this policy declared in the first place? To indict the Muslim neighbours and wear ""Hindu Rashtra"" on India’s sleeve by projecting Sikhs and Buddhist as Hindus. This pro Hindu stance is traceable to BJP’s election manifesto to be renewed, no doubt, in 2019. BJP’s coalition partner, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), sees this in a different way. If the Bill goes through, Hindus will not have to prove their credentials unlike Muslims. The AGP resists this a Hindu invasion — as, indeed, does Meghalaya threatening a breaking of ties. The citizenship process should be more efficient and humane; but this Bill is ill-conceived, communal and ill-advised.  ",2018-06-11,"Muslim,Bangladesh,Pakistan,Northeast","Why the Citizenship Bill 2016 is ill-conceived, communal and ill-advised",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/citizenship-bill-2016-assam-northeast-pakistan-bangladesh-muslim/story/1/24784.html
341,Saroj Giri,"Today there is a new Maoism, a new "" "" in town. Like a new species, terrible and grotesque, as though borne out of eating plastic. With strange new organs and weird desires, new letter-writing skills and novel intentions. The hidden underground is now hypervisible, leaving its telltale signs everywhere. It works through the ""link"". The ""Maoist link"" is in abundant supply. Everyone, from the Congress to the Left to whoever is ""anti-national"", are mere shadows, mere cover for the hidden underground. Dalit radicals are very condescendingly reduced to being mere ""conduits"". This is the ""Maoist 2.0"", a new species in town, a new product launched. It leaves nothing untouched — except the core of the pure nationalist who now discovers yet another ""plot"" in town, eating up the Hindu nation (provisionally called India) from within. It stretches from Pulwama to Bastar. The Nazis saw the Jewish-Bolshevik hidden plot destabilising the ""great German nation"". Here is a jihadi-Maoist plot to destabilise the nation. Ah, but the Dalit angle is the spanner in the wheels. , with 200-year-old memories of Dalits rejecting the Peshwa's embryonic Hindu nation, prevents the ease with which the Maoists could be clubbed with the jihadis. With Dalits, there is no way the Pakistan angle can be brought into the picture: the ""plot"" loses steam. Just notice how   on the entire episode have been sidelined, even though he is a Union minister in the present government. What ecosystem is producing this Maoist 2.0? Since quite some time now, the ""conscience of the nation"" has ruled over us, degrading the sanctity of the so-called ""rule of law"". This conscience no longer needed the law, particularly when it would consummate itself in the wee hours of the dawn, when a life would be secretly snuffed out. The ""deep state"", with shady-shadowy intelligence agencies fighting the ghost of a Hemant Karkare, upheld this conscience, inscribing it perforce on society. They worked in utter sync, pre-2014. Soon it turned out that this conscience is nothing but what the trolls say and want. The deep state is like a mafioso with a mandate from the 'masses' who are today nothing but trolls, the new ""janta janardhan"". If you are not following the trolls, then you are not connected to the conscience of the nation. Then you are elitist, you are dictatorial, you are dynastic, you are ""foreign"". Prime Minister Modi understands this very well. He embodies this truth. Trolls and the deep state, IT cells and the ATS — they work in perfect harmony, be it under the Congress or the BJP government. Journalism judges the conscience and mood of the nation from trolls. Those TV anchors must go out of their way  . They must act as the arm of the deep state, an extension of the police and the official mouthpiece of the Army. The police ""doing its work"" is synonymous with the law — the courts of law being just an irritant. Police are bouncers of the Hindu nation. ""Evidence"" is what the police says evidence is. If the police shoots, as in  , then the protestors (now branded as ""left-liberals"" or ""JNU-Pak agents"") must have deserved it — no, not even ""must have"", but ""surely deserved"" it, were ""asking for it"". In fact, they always deserve it. They need not do anything to deserve it. By just existing, by just breathing and walking and living, they are already guilty. No case is required against them. They must be eliminated. Since they would anyways do something heinous against the nation, it would obviously be foolish to wait till they act and destroy our nation! So, the  , only to be later acquitted by the court as innocent, cannot make us feel bad for having being unjust towards him — for we were only acting to prevent disaster! Prevention is better than cure — ain't it? Recall here the nightmarish perfect world in   (2002) where murderers would be caught before they could kill, and the innocent would never live in fear. We must, as the highest ethical act, in fact, duty to the nation, foist a case on ""them"". The ""fake letter"" must be   produced. If one exists in reality, fine; if it does not, then it must be produced. From 'R' to 'M', 'M' to 'R', or 'Q' to 'P', we need a letter, fake or otherwise. It might be technically fake, but it will be really and truly fake only to the traitors, whose heart does not beat for the nation! Nothing less than the reported story of the plotted assassination of the prime minister is being peddled in ""the letter"". One would imagine that the public prosecutor Ujjwala Pawar would produce it in the court to demand maximum punishment to the plotters in order to save our dear prime minister. But no — she only leaks it to the famous ""godi media"", but  . Such disregard for the life of the prime minister! Finally, in the run-up to 2019, the ""deep state plus troll plus godi media"" is going to be hitched onto Amit Shah’s electoral machine — that is why there is so much effort to put those like Jignesh Mevani and the Bhim Army in the dock.

342,Nikhil Wagle,"Uddhav Thackeray must indeed be a happy man today. BJP president Amit Shah’s visit to his residence, Matoshree, has become a political football. For the past four years, whether it was privately or publicly, the BJP spared no opportunity to insult him. During election time, there was mud-slinging from both sides. But in the light of the BJP’s by-poll debacle, the equation appears to have changed. The BJP needs the support of the allies more than the allies need the Modi-Shah duo. And thus, Amit Shah has pirouetted to the ""coalition dharma"" strategy yet again. He plans to meet all top leaders of the NDA. The BJP may have won the Palghar Lok Sabha by-poll in Maharashtra, but the Shiv Sena was quite indomitable having put up a valiant fight. Considering that this was a traditional BJP seat and the Shiv Sena was fighting this election for first time in 25 years, its performance was admirable. The Shiv Sena got more than 2.5 lakh votes while the BJP won by a narrow margin of 30,000 votes. In the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP’s margin of victory here was more than 1.5 lakhs. Uddhav Thackeray drew attention to this during the post-poll press conference and once again announced the Shiv Sena’s resolve to fight all future elections, independently. It was against this background that Amit Shah sought Uddhav’s audience. As expected, Uddhav Thackeray obliged the BJP president. However, Uddhav set the terms for the meeting. Today, the BJP is floundering and, therefore, desperate about its alliance with the Shiv Sena. So much so that senior leader Nitin Gadkari even publicly acknowledged this. Prior to the Matoshree visit, Amit Shah made an announcement during a TV interview that both parties would fight future elections together. The Shiv Sena though refused to comment on it. Uddhav demanded a one-on-one meeting with Shah and the BJP agreed. The tête-à-tête was arranged at Matoshree. The state BJP president was not invited. Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis did accompany Amit Shah to Matoshree but was asked to abnegate from attending the meeting. Both Shah and Thackeray did not address the media after their meeting. But sources within the BJP informed journalists that the outcome of the meeting was extremely positive. The Sena refused to confirm. Uddhav Thackeray is in an enviable position today. On the one hand, the BJP is beseeching him for an alliance for future elections and on the other, Sharad Pawar has invited him to join the Opposition alliance. The Sena stands to benefit either way with the proverbial "" . Before arriving at any final decision, Uddhav has to iron out the differences within his party. A group of senior Sena ministers and MPs, approbates the alliance with the BJP while grassroots leaders are against it. The Sena has been performing a double role in this alliance for the past four years. It is implicit in the alliance at the Mantralaya, but on the ground, it works as an Opposition party. Maharashtra has seen the BJP and Sena leaders in a head-on tussle in various constituencies. Shiv Sainiks are fed up of this situation. If Uddhav decides to march to his own beat and go alone, it will hurt both the parties. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP and Sena together won 42 seats. Today, in the absence of any wave, it is difficult to repeat this performance. Division of votes between the two parties, will directly benefit the Congress-NCP combine. It is this electoral arithmetic that Amit Shah is trying to drive home, with Uddhav. Will Uddhav accept Sharad Pawar’s invitation? That would prove very difficult for a party, which has survived all its life on the anti-Congress plank. It will not be an easy task for Uddhav to convince his voters and workers about such an alliance. It is bound to hurt Sena’s base and consequently, the BJP is bound to exploit it. Their agenda of Hindutva is yet another obstacle. And Amit Shah is more than aware of this. According to Sena insiders, Uddhav will wait till the Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. If the BJP loses these states, the NDA allies will definitely have an upper hand. As per surveys, it will be difficult for the BJP to get a majority in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll. Modi’s popularity is on a steady decline. In such a situation, Uddhav and his party can play a critical role. Uddhav always wanted to play the ""big brother"" to the BJP, just like his father Bal Thackeray once did. But Narendra Modi-Amit Shah simply did not give him that opportunity after the 2014 elections. Now is his chance to strike back. For now, it will be ""wait and watch"" for Uddhav Thackeray. Presently, he is busy savouring the situation, but will definitely try to demand his pound of flesh from the BJP in the near future. Definitely, ""Achhe Din"" for Shiv Sena!",2018-06-09,"Maharashtra,Amit Shah,Uddhav Thackeray,Shiv sena-bjp",Will Uddhav Thackeray patch up with the BJP?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/shiv-sena-bjp-alliance-amit-shah-uddhav-thackeray-matoshree-meeting-maharashtra-lok-sabha-2019-polls/story/1/24757.html
343,Panini Anand,"Former President Pranab Mukherjee’s June 7 visit to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) headquarters in Nagpur has brought in several gifts for the Sangh and the BJP. While many have tried to explain away the momentous visit by saying that Mukherjee has personal ties with Mohan Bhagwat, and, as President, had even broken protocol to receive the RSS chief, that is only a tiny part of the story.   The news of Mukherjee’s accepting the RSS invite was met with immediate outrage, not just from his own party, the Congress, but from other political parties as well as experts and activists. The former President was repeatedly advised to stay away from the event and Congress leader Sharmistha, who warned him that his speech would be forgotten, but pictures of him with RSS leaders would haunt Mukherjee forever.   However, one needs to understand why the RSS, in a carefully crafted move, chose to reach out to Mukherjee. The first and obvious benefit of the step was the unprecedented publicity the event, the Tritiya Varsha Sangh Shiksha Varg, received. Usually a side news item, the event this year dominated prime time slots, and was telecast live on most major news channels. The curiosity of seeing Mukherjee in the RSS’s courtyard kept people glued to their TV screens, and the entire nation watched as swayamsevaks went through their moves and marches, after which their president Mohan Bhagwat took the stage. Conscious of his larger audience, Bhagwat, though he did speak of the Hindu rashtra, kept his speech controlled, and tried to present a more accommodative picture of the Sangh. The RSS chief’s statements of unity in diversity, of all Indians, irrespective of religion and caste, being the children of Bharat Mata and sharing a common ancestry, are sure to strike a chord with moderate Hindus too. The Sangh has realised that the emotive issues of Jinnah are fading in front of the real questions of ganna and to win over voters, it needs to present a more tolerant face. Thus, both the BJP and the RSS have set out on outreach drives. Bhagwat’s address with former president and Congress-man Pranab Mukherjee on stage was nothing less than the opening speech of the RSS’s battle for 2019, and it has managed to use Mukherjee rather well to refurbish its image. The second largest beneficiary of June 7’s event has been the BJP. The saffron party well knows that it is in no position to repeat its 2014 General Elections performance in 2019. Sources say that the BJP is likely to change its candidates in 150 constituencies. It fears defeat on 80 of the seats it currently holds in the Parliament. However, it is hoping to win 50 new berths, some of which are in Odisha and Bengal. In this scenario, a tall leader from Bengal, Pranab da, speaking from the RSS stage, is likely to fetch rich dividends for the BJP in the state. The party will leave no stone unturned in linking Pranab’s invitation and speech to Bengali pride and milking it electorally. For Odisha, it is being heard that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to contest the 2019 polls from Puri. If both these moves work, the BJP will be sitting pretty indeed. According to sources, Amit Shah is hoping to win 22 seats from Bengal. Apart from this, Mukherjee’s presence at the RSS event has also helped the BJP’s ongoing mission of appropriating Congress leaders. Gandhi’s spectacles have become the symbol of Modi sarkar schemes, the government is literally moving boulders for Sardar Patel’s statue. The PM himself has appeared hard at work to get an Ambedkar memorial constructed and to highlight the Congress’s “ill treatment” of the Dalit leader. The BJP also keeps inviting family members of Subhas Chandra Bose and Lal Bahadur Shastri to its events, in order to chip away at the Congress’s claims on these icons and present the Congress as just one family’s party.   Mukherjee’s presence at the RSS stage is also both a warning and a way forward for Congress old-timers. Ever since the event, the Sangh and the BJP have been singing paeans in Mukherjee’s praise, which sends out a distinct message to dissatisfied veterans within the Congress. Several Congress heavyweights have already joined the BJP. On social media platforms, however, the dirty tricks of morphing images and twisting statements have already begun. The photos doing the rounds present a true picture of neither Mukherjee’s presence, nor his message. How the former President’s image will suffer because of these remains to be seen. The biggest benefit for the RSS, however, is that the Congress, which has accused it of numberous charges, from saffron terror to Mahatma Gandhi’s murder, now faces a Vibhishan in its own home. In the past, Congress president Rahul Gandhi has termed the RSS and the BJP “fascists” and “enemies of democracy”. This stance is difficult to reconcile with a senior Congress leader sharing the RSS stage. Another crucial fact is that the BJP and the RSS want the Congress to stay mired in the traps they set for it. At a time when the Opposition should be taking the government to task over its performance, the Congress is struggling with its own differences and discrepancies. The Sangh and the BJP, thus, are clearly setting the agenda and pulling the strings here. The Opposition is merely tripping over them.",2018-06-08,"Congress,BJP,RSS,Pranab Mukherjee","Pranab Mukherjee at RSS event: Much to cheer for BJP, Sangh",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pranab-mukherjee-rss-bjp-congress-nagpur/story/1/24741.html
344,Kiran Tare,"The BJP’s defeat in the Bhandara-Gondiya Lok Sabha bypoll is a warning bell for chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who was the main campaigner there. His first defeat in the Vidarbha region since he took over the reins in October 2014 indicates that the BJP is slowly losing ground in its stronghold. Fadnavis managed to retain the Palghar Lok Sabha seat for the BJP using his political manoeuvring. However, his slight overconfidence cost the party Bhandara-Gondiya. The bypoll was a referendum on former MP Nana Patole’s allegation of arrogance against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Fadnavis. Patole was the first BJP MP who had resigned taking on the party’s top leadership. He had publicly complained that Modi humiliated him at a meeting of MPs. He had criticised Fadnavis for not considering his colleagues’ opinion while taking important decisions such as loan waiver to the farmers. He had said that farmers were finding it difficult to avail benefits of the loan waiver scheme because of its complex nature. The defeat is a setback for the BJP, which has legislators in five out of six Assembly segments in Bhandara-Gondiya. It failed to take lead in any of the five segments. In a smart move, the NCP, which bagged the seat in alliance with the Congress, fielded former three-time BJP MLA Madhukar Kukde against the BJP’s Hemant Patle. Kukde registered a comfortable victory with a margin of 47,899 votes in the constituency dominated by the Kunbi community. Like Palghar Fadnavis was the BJP’s main campaigner in Bhandara-Gondiya. He had planned the party’s poll strategy and its execution. Except for one rally by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, the focus of the campaign was Fadnavis only. He had appealed to the voters to teach a lesson to Patole for backstabbing the BJP. Insiders in the BJP say that the party could not put a strong third candidate who could have made a dent in the Congress-NCP votes. They say infighting is also a reason for the loss. All the five BJP MLAs in Bhandara-Gondiya looked at the bypoll as an opportunity to settle their score with Fadnavis for neglecting them. Most of the 44 BJP MLAs from Vidarbha look at Gadkari as their leader. They had openly vouched for Gadkari as CM after the party came to power. “Devendraji still does not have cordial relations with them. Bhandara-Gondiya is a reflection of trust deficit,” a BJP insider said. Fadnavis blamed water scarcity in Bhandara-Gondiya for the loss. “There is a drought-like situation for the first time in 35 years. It affected the voters’ turnout and led to our defeat,” he said. In 2014, the BJP-Shiv Sena had won all 11 Lok Sabha seats in Vidarbha. The BJP alone won 44 Assembly seats. In 2019, as the Shiv Sena will fight alone and the Congress and the NCP will have a joint front, the BJP might find it difficult to repeat the 2014 feat. Fadnavis needs a strong backing from Vidarbha to become CM again.

345,Zoheb Hasan,"No region in recent times has acquired as much speculation and engrossment as the Middle East (technically it includes Afghanistan, West Asia and Egypt). However, my viewpoint hovers around West Asia, which is the world's principal energy hub and holds almost 60 per cent of the planet's known oil and gas reserves. Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the region has invited pharaonic attention as events which unfolded after it continue to have a spell on the region, in Islamic world and on Muslim psyche. The US' invasion of Iraq in 2003 on a spurious assumption that the then leader Saddam Hussein possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) stifled the nation like never before. The attack came at a time when the country was still recovering from the inhumane sanctions imposed on it by Uncle Sam in the aftermath of the First Gulf War (1990-91) and threw the country into a quagmire with sectarian conflict tearing the country apart. Many more people died in Iraq following the invasion than due to any other factor ever before. Since the sectarian conflict in Iraq primarily involved Shias and Sunnis, it invited interference from regional heavyweights - Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran. Significantly, the American invasion helped Iran (a country which US considers to be a perpetual threat to peace and stability in West Asia) gain a foothold in strife-torn Iraq because of Shia brotherhood and carred its influence to adjoining Syria where again the ruling disposition is Alawite or Nusayri, a minority Shia sub-sect considered heretic by mainstream Muslims — Sunni and Shia alike. Iran has horned itself strong in the ongoing Yemeni civil war where it is charged with providing financial and logistical support to the Shia Houthi rebels. The Houthi or Zaidiya'a are again a Shia sub-sect, which incidentally has beliefs more in conformity with the Sunnis than the mainstream Ith'na Ashari or the Twelver Shia. That the Persian or Iranian influence gaining credence in large swathes of the Arabic speaking region naturally invited the displeasure of region's economic powerhouse - Saudi Arabia, which shares a bitter and hostile relationship with the Ayatollah-dominated Iran since the revolution of 1979. While some overtures in cooling off the tensions were made during the reign of King Abdullah (2005-15) and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, none of them materialised and the distrust now is greater than ever. Some years back, eloquent Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir accused Iran of adopting dubious ways to gain access to the Arab world's internal matters and also said that Iran's constitutional charter calls for exporting its ""Islamic Revolution"" outside also. It must also be noted that the Arabs and Persians have a disdain for each other since the pre-Islamic era. The fillip to the successful Arab occupation of Persia was provided in the Battle of Qadisiyah (636AD) led by Sa'ad Ibn Abi Waqqas, a companion of Prophet Muhammad, and the final subjugation of the mighty Sassanid Persian empire undertaken by the second Caliph Umar Ibn Al Khattab in 642 AD. But the Persians never accepted Arab customs and way of life and their language though they did adopt the Arabic script with some modifications of their own. To this day the Iranians take excessive pride in their culture and history and have retained many customs and traditions from the Sassanid Empire making them a part of the Shia faith. The demographic divide is essential in understanding things better in the region. West Asia comprises 14 countries — Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates or UAE, Turkey, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Of these Iran, Iraq and Bahrain are strong Shia majority states and a large Shia population is also found in the oil-rich eastern Al Hasa region of Saudi Arabia adjacent to the Persian Gulf. Shias exercise a disproportionate influence in Lebanon (through armed militia Hezbollah) and Syria where Alawite Bashar al-Assad is back in business. They are also locked in a bitter struggle with Saudi Arabia-backed forces in Yemen. The Sunni Arab states are divided with Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain forming an axis against Qatar while Kuwait, Jordan and Turkey shielding it. Oman where the little known Ibadhi sect of Islam predominates has remained sympathetic to Qatar and shares a ""more than normal"" relationship with Iran much to the chagrin of Saudi Arabia. Yet, the latter overlooks it because Oman is also a member of the Saudi-led alliance against terrorism, which excludes Iran and is willing to play a mediator in Yemen with which it shares the border. Omani monarch, Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, remains the longest serving leader in the Arab and Muslim world. Against this backdrop, Saudi Arabia lobbied hard to make ensure it becomes the first country US President Donald Trump visits after taking office and inking a $150-billion arms deal ostensibly to contain the growing Iranian influence. Under the new de facto ruler Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, or MBS, the kingdom has pursued a more aggressive proactive policy to keep Saudi influence paramount and there are reports of him cosying up to Israel - the Arab world's arch nemesis to cut Iran to size. The recent abjuration of the nuclear deal with Iran by the Trump administration is the first step in this direction. A military solution or attack on Iran, however, seems a distant possibility with Trump having made it clear that US would not undertake any military involvement in West Asia lest it puts a drain on American economy. Apart from this, barring Saudi Arabia and the UAE, all other Arab states and Turkey favour a dialogue with Iran. With Iraq now out of the picture and reconciliatory talks with North Korea looking a possibility in the much anticipated Kim-Trump meet, the US is free to check the last remnant of its so called ""Axis of Evil"" — Iran. Weariness is visible also on the Saudi economy because of its involvement in the Syrian and Yemeni conflicts and has rendered the Gulf Cooperation Council or the GCC — the organisation of six oil rich Arab Gulf states - redundant as of now by threatening Qatar, which is the richest state in the region and is endearing itself strongly to the Muslim world through its television news network — Al Jazeera and has long supported the Ikhwan or the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, whose popularly elected leader Mohammed Morsi was ousted in a Saudi engineered military coup. The hostilities among the Arab states and the Iran factor have emboldened Israel to pursue an ever ruthless policy vis-a-vis the Palestinians. The situation has been   to relocate US embassy to Jerusalem. The Saudi Arabian establishment as of today has totally abandoned the Palestinian cause, a complete U-turn since the days of King Faisal. Added to this is the bickering inside the royal family due to the intimidating actions of Mohammed Bin Salman, which is threatening to implode the House of Saud. In fact, Mohammed Bin Salman, Shaikh Mohammed Bin Zayed, emir of Abu Dhabi, and Shaikh Tamim Bin Khalifa Al Thani, the emir of Qatar are over ambitious and eager to expand their footprint in the region. Not surprisingly, Sheikh Sabah of Kuwait and Sultan Qaboos of Oman, the surviving old guard in the GCC, have distanced themselves from the internal bickering, calling for restraint. As of now, the US influence is dwindling in the region in relation to managing the affairs to its advantage so Trump is cosying (more than any other US President in recent times) up to Israel while new players like Russia are increasingly showing assertiveness. This assertiveness has forced a thinking in sheikhdom to do business with them. After all, Mohammad Bin Zayed recently took a two-day visit to Moscow while Qatar is in talks to buy the advance S-400 aircraft from Russia much to Saudi Arabia's displeasure.

346,Yashee,"The probe into Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon violence occurring in January this year took a surprising turn on June 6, with the police  Dalit and left wing activists, and booking them under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The  Rona Wilson, activist and JNU alumnus, activist Rana Jacob, Sudhir Dhawale, a Dalit activist and office-bearer of the Elgar Parishad, held on December 31, just before the Battle of Bhima Koregaon anniversary this time, activists Shoma Sen and Mahesh Raut, and lawyer Surendra Gadling, from Delhi, Mumbai and Nagpur, have led to protests, with many claiming these to be unfair victimisation.    
 
 
 
 People have also pointed out that the stringent action against the activists is in stark contrast to the way the two saffron leaders booked for the violence, Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote, have been treated – while Ekbote is  in both the cases registered against him, Bhide “guruji” has not been arrested, with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis   to his innocence. With the arrests, the case, initially seen as a clash between Dalits and upper castes over an event polarising in itself – the Bhima Koregaon anniversary celebrates the defeat of the Peshwas by a British battalion aided by Dalits sepoys – has now been framed in a very different binary: was the violence the work of the extreme Left, or the extreme Right? Also, will the BJP, in power at both the Centre and in Maharashtra and often accused of going soft on right wing violence, be able to ensure a fair probe and trial? The activists have been arrested after the Pune police allegedly recovered a letter from Rona Wilson’s laptop, written,  , by one “Comrade M, who we believe is a senior member of CPI-Maoist's central committee.” as saying: “The letter said the one riot fatality should be exploited and more such events should be held at places governed by BJP. It said sympathisers in London, Sweden and US backed the movement, and asked for new passwords to be sent out to the group to plan future course of action.” The BJP has been quick to seize on this, and has gone to town blaming, rather strangely,  for the violence. Charges of an international conspiracy by left wing extremists to “exploit” deaths in India are very serious, and cannot be allowed to float around vaguely. The police must probe them thoroughly and take them to a logical conclusion. However, equally serious are charges of a right-wing that is reportedly being   by the state, drunk on notions of caste and religious superiority, out to re-organise Indian society according to the world order it believes in, where Dalits are seen as the children of lesser gods.   Unfortunately, evidence of this ideology at play, and the state’s turning an indulgent eye to it, are not too difficult to find. June 8 will mark one year of the Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Ravan’s imprisonment, in jail over the Rajput-Dalit clash in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur. ‘Ravan’ had the non-bailable National Securities Act slapped against him  the Allahabad high court granted him bail in November. The Rajputs booked over the clashes are out on bail. A similar script has been at play in   where the accused are ideologically on the side of the ruling party – Pehlu Khan killed by gau rakshaks in Rajasthan, teenager Junaid Khan’s lynching near Faridabad, the murder of Mohammad Akhlaq over cow slaughter suspicions in Uttar Pradesh. While the police must probe whatever criminal activities it suspects the arrested accused of,   seem to read a lot like right wing paranoia. The police has described those arrested as “top urban Maoist operatives”. “Urban Maoist” is a term used almost exclusively, but liberally, by the Right to describe everyone it does not like – activists, media organisations, citizen protesters.    During the farmers’ protest that rocked Maharashtra in May this year, BJP MP  the agitators as urban Maoists. Filmmaker and right wing commentator Vivek Agnihotri,   in  , warns: “In the cities, an invisible naxal-intelligentsia-media-academia-NGO-activist nexus works as strategic fortification with the ultimate aim of taking over the Indian state to achieve Maoist rule.” 
 
 This aside, one of the charges against the activists arrested on June 6 is of . The legacy of the Peshwas continues to be disputed. For many marginal communities, the Peshwas appeared as supremacist Brahmins under whom Dalits, for instance, to wipe out their footprints and hang pots around their necks to collect their spit. “Raising slogans” or simply expressing discontent over certain wrongs of history – without threatening vengeance in the present – does not seem an adequate crime in modern, democratic India. What is puzzling though is another aspect. Ekbote and Bhide have both been close to the BJP. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself  , saying he came to Sangli on “guruji’s call”. The Maharashtra government in 2015  for the Padma Shri. Ekbote   a BJP corporator, has links with the RSS, and a string of criminal cases. 
 
 Yet, in the immediate aftermath of the violence in January, his  that the police had advised him to lie low, and that Ekbote would be back in Pune once the “cops gave the green signal”. On April 22, a   violence, was found dead in a well. Her family had alleged she was “  to withdraw her statement against the men who set fire to their house. Those protesting the arrest of the activists claim this is just a way to intimidate and break the spirits of those working for the Dalits and the marginalised. The Maharashtra unit of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL),  after the arrests, has said: “These arrests amount to a blatant violation of citizen’s rights to freedom of expression and voicing dissent… People are arrested and incarcerated in jail for years. They are subsequently released as the State fails to prove their case…” The Bhima Koregaon case, thus, pits two very different ideologies against each other. As of now, the ruling party appears clearly sympathetic to one. While the guilty must be punished, it is the government that also needs to acquit itself honourably.  ",2018-06-07,"Urban maoists,Maharashtra,Dalit activists arrested,Bhima Koregaon violence",'Saffron terror' or 'urban Maoism': What's behind Bhima Koregaon violence?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-dalit-activists-arrested-left-wing-urban-maoism-milind-ekbote-sambhaji-bhide-bjp-maharashtra/story/1/24720.html
347,Amit Sengupta,"On June 3, at least 5,000 people walked in silence with the body of a schoolgirl,  , in the scorching heat, amid wailing friends and relatives, with a band playing a farewell song. Some fainted on the way, quickly carried away by volunteers. At the Sahaya Annai Church at Lionstown, with her body in the coffin and flowers hiding her face, it was a solemn occasion, replete with collective tragedy and anger. Snowlin was shot dead at the Collectorate by an unknown sniper on May 22, as a mass procession of peaceful protestors moved towards the district collector’s office, to hand over a petition. A bullet entered her neck and smashed her face. That is why, the flowers in her coffin were hiding her face. Locals are convinced that many of the . Tamilarasan was the coordinator of the  . Snowlin was at the forefront of the Madha Koil protest. Maniraj was the organiser at Damodar Nagar, and Gladston coordinated the rally at Metupatti. They were all shot dead — reportedly by the snipers, on the head or chest. Alleged targeted killing was also reported in Terespuram, a fishermen’s colony. A 47-year-old woman, an anti-Sterlite leader who did not participate in the rally on May 22, was on her way to her daughter’s house in the neighbourhood.  She was shot in her head — her face was destroyed. Terespuram was not under Section 144, as was the area near the Sterlite plant and the Collectorate. So why did the cops shoot to kill her? The Tuticorin police and district administration were on tenterhooks on June 3. The entire top brass was holed up at the Collectorate. The district collector and superintendent of police, who held charge on May 22, have been transferred. The industrial hub was tense, simmering with rage and sorrow. Across the town were splashed huge posters announcing the funeral with the following message in Tamil (loosely translated): “She is dead, but we are not defeated. We will rise again, until Sterlite is forced to go.” No wonder, there was not a single cop accompanying the funeral procession. Snowlin was one of the young leaders of the mass protests, which originated in thousands from lanes, bylanes and villages, walking across miles to escape police barricades. She was one of those who led the rally onto the Tirunelveli Street, close to the Third  Mile Bridge, which is adjacent to the ""gateway"" to the collector’s office. The first killings happened here on May 22. A woman in Anna Nagar went with her daughter and son to the rally. She said that Snowlin told her moments before she was shot dead that “we have to fight for our generation and the future generations”. “She held onto my daughter as she fell, her face smeared with blood,” said the woman. Did she see who shot her? “No,” she said. Snowlin was with three of her school friends, according to those who saw her there. Her friend, Infanta, just about escaped, when a bullet, again, fired from an unknown area, perhaps from a height, by an unknown sniper, almost grazed her. Another school-going friend had her hand twisted so brutally by a cop that her hand is in a plaster cast. I saw her picture with an activist, she, smiling, despite the pain, her hand in a plaster cast. Can I take this picture, I asked? The activist refused. She said the schoolgirl does not want to share it — the cops will then file false cases against her, as it has done against hundreds of others, mostly youngsters. Days after the firing which killed 13 people, in a largely peaceful protest with women carrying their children along and packing basic food and sheets for a prolonged non-violent dharna, the death toll has gone up to 15. Terror looms large across the town and villages surrounding the Sterlite factory, which has been ordered to “permanently” shut down by the Tamil Nadu government, which defended the killings.   Even after May 22, there have been police atrocities all over the localities, young men are picked up randomly, beaten up for many  hours, detained on fake charges, and, sometimes, allowed to leave with the threat to keep their mouth shut. Around 95 people, mostly youngsters and teenagers, were picked up on May 22 morning. They were illegally detained at South Police Station and SIPCOT Police Station. They were reportedly stripped, made to sit in only their underwear, assaulted, kicked and thrashed. No food or water was given to them until May 23 evening. Many of them had their limbs swollen and were found limping. A police inspector, Hariharan, from the SIPCOT Police Station, has been named in this case, as in many other cases of illegal detention and torture, by locals. His notoriety across Tuticorin is legendary. Locals allege that “he is on the payroll of Vedanta”. He was transferred on June 2 from the SIPCOT Police Station to Madurai. At the intervention of the Tuticorin Bar Association, the principal district judge gave directions for the magistrate to visit the police station to enquire about the 95 detained persons. The police shifted all these men to the Vallanadu Shooting Range, thereby deliberately deceiving the magistrate.  Finally, when the magistrate reached the firing range, he found that 30 of them were minors/juveniles. He ordered their immediate release. Members of the Tuticorin Bar Association informed this columnist that the district judge released 366 innocent people who were falsely detained without any bail or surety after a marathon court session which stretched till late night. The entire Tuticorin town seems to be proud of the Bar Association and is full of praise for the extraordinary woman judge, V Charuhasini, who has since retired. On May 23, as hundreds gathered at the general hospital where the dead bodies were kept, the police randomly lathi-charged, used rubber and metal bullets, barged into homes, smashed cars, windows, doors and two-wheelers, and beat up  all and sundry, including mothers and sisters. This was most prevalent in Anna Nagar, which is close to the hospital on the main road, though at quite a distance from the Sterlite smelter plant. One person, Kaliappan, was killed by the police. This columnist heard several eye-witness accounts of residents in Anna Nagar. A young woman’s little children were not spared. She said, in tears, that 15 cops entered her house, threw her two-year-old daughter on a wall, and when her five-year-old brother rushed to his little sister, they stamped his chest with boots. Two of her family members, both educated, young men, were taken to the police station, their hands tied to the window, and beaten up for hours. There are scars all over their bodies now.   A young boy was targeted by cops, and asked to locate an address. As he walked along, he was taken to a police vehicle and then assaulted. “For two days the police were coming again and again, shooting rubber and metal bullets at random, breaking open doors, barging into homes and beating up people. They were searching door to door and would beat up and pick up all young men, come what may, though most of them had nothing to do with the rally,” said a young girl who works in a bank. At KVK Nagar, three young men were talking in their verandah, when the cops took them away. They assaulted them for almost 24 hours inside the police vehicle, with no medical relief, food or water. “A car was burning in the distance. So the cops said, book them in this case,” said one of them. A father sent away his young son before May 22 to another town. He came back on May 29. He was picked up while he was riding a bike. He is still in jail. Similarly, in a village close to the Sterlite factory, Meelavittan, where women are in the forefront of the peaceful movement, cops in mufti arrived at 3am in the morning on May 31 and randomly picked up three young men. One of them was going to Kuwait for a job. The women went to the district collector next day. He said they will be released in an hour. They are still in the Palayamkottai Central Prison. It is confirmed from local sources that hundreds of injured are still hiding with their injuries, refusing to come out, afraid that the police will book them. The general hospital did not register police atrocities as the reason behind the injuries in many cases. Private doctors prescribed medicines without assigning the reason behind injuries. Some of them simply mentioned: “Blunt injuries.” Several FIRs have been lodged and clubbed together against scores of ""innocents"" to ""crush the movement"", said community leaders. This pre-announced ""rally"" on May 22, with a strength ranging between 50,000 and 70,000 people, was the culmination of protracted non-violent protests for 99 days demanding the shut-down and removal of Vedanta’s Sterlite copper smelter plant in Tuticorin. People have been up against the smelter plant which produces more than 40 lakh tonnes of copper since the past two decades. There is no medical evidence to prove it, but almost the entire town is convinced that various diseases have stalked the population, including cancer, heart problems, skin and breathing diseases and 24 -hours itching due to air, water and ground-level pollution generated by the plant and the waste it disposes. The water in the villages close to the Sterlite plant is dirty yellow and undrinkable. Amid bouts of stomach and other medical problems faced by schoolchildren, even villagers are forced to buy mineral water from the market. Significantly, this columnist witnessed square white patches on the bodies of several men and women, which spreads into shapeless patches across the body. Locals call it the “Sterlite patch”. Doctors outside Tuticorin have advised patients to move out of the area. So much so, there are reports that people in other towns and villages are refusing to get their sons and daughters married here. Allegations that ""outsiders or extremists"" initiated violence has been denied by all the parties and associations here, including the Tuticorin Bar Association and merchants' associations. Prof Fathima Babu, who has led the peaceful struggle since the beginning, pointed out that the district administration had agreed in a meeting with various organisations on May 20 (in which   was absent) that the rally can be held at the SAV Ground on May 22. “The whole town was prepared to go to the Collectorate on the 100  day. However, we were concerned with the safety of the women, children and others. So, we agreed to hold the peaceful rally at the SAV Ground. However, there was massive barricading and people were stopped at their localities and villages and not even allowed to enter the ground,” she said. Thereby, the scattered crowd started moving towards the Collectorate. Significantly, both the district collector  and SP Mahendran were reportedly not in town on this crucial day of mass protests. There are unconfirmed reports that the police firing order was finally given by three deputy tehsildars with magisterial powers. Section 144 was imposed near the Sterlite plant and the Collectorate. However, except a few places, no announcement was made by the administration. The collector did not communicate with the people at all during the 99 days of protests. No warning was given on loudspeakers or otherwise. TV scrolls late at night did not help. No tear gas, water cannons or lathicharge was used. The first killings, allegedly, were by the snipers. And why did the police kill people where there was no Section 144 imposed, as in Anna Nagar and Terespuram? There is nothing normal in Tuticorin now. The wounds are deep, irreconcilable and simmering. The terror machine of the state backed by Sterlite has taken a pause, but their character is out in the open. And, yet, one thing is certain: People will not rest here until they get justice.

348,Ananth Krishnan,"Later this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to China for the second time in just over a month — for the June 9 and 10 Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in the port city of Qingdao. Besides formalising the entry of India as a full member of the China and Russia-led Eurasian security grouping, Modi will have his second bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in just over a month, following his April 28 and 29 “informal” summit in Wuhan. In one sense, the significance of Modi’s attendance at the SCO summit lies essentially just in his being there — and the symbolism of his being on stage flanked by Xi, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, and leaders of the other SCO members including Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, besides heads of state from observer countries including Iran, Afghanistan and Mongolia. This is part of PM Modi’s emphasis on “strategic autonomy” — a balancing act as he pushes closer security ties with the US, Japan and many of China’s neighbours, even as he mends fences with China. This balancing was apparent in Modi’s keenly followed keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore last week. “No other relationship of India has as many layers as our relations with China,” he said. “We are the world’s two most populous countries and among the fastest growing major economies. Our cooperation is expanding. Trade is growing. And, we have displayed maturity and wisdom in managing issues and ensuring a peaceful border.” China promptly welcomed his comments. Yet, the overall tone of his speech was far from being entirely optimistic on relations with China. In fact, Modi’s outlining of his “Indo-Pacific” vision was more than clear on India’s discomfort with China’s muscle-flexing, both militarily and economically. As Modi put it, “a common rules-based order for the region… must equally apply to all individually as well as to the global commons”. “Such an order must believe in sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as equality of all nations, irrespective of size and strength. These rules and norms should be based on the consent of all, not on the power of the few. This must be based on faith in dialogue and not dependence on force. It also means that when nations make international commitments, they must uphold them.” Given the regional focus on China’s island-building and militarisation in the disputed South China Sea, the target of his message was evident. Modi also said connectivity initiatives “must be based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, consultation, good governance, transparency, viability and sustainability” and “must empower nations, not place them under impossible debt burden.” Again, the target was apparent — China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Herein lies India’s dilemma as it continues its balancing this week at the SCO. The summit’s members are expected to strongly endorse China’s BRI. As foreign minister Wang Yi said last week, “The Qingdao summit will lay out new plans to enhance the synergy of development strategies of member states, especially promoting the construction of the Belt and Road to lift regional economic cooperation.” India is expected to be the only country in the Qingdao declaration to not endorse the BRI, as was the case at the recent SCO foreign ministers meet where the final statement awkwardly named the ministers of all countries, barring India, in the part of the statement that named the BRI. Still, India believes it stands to gain from its membership in a body that provides another platform to keep channels open and ties stable with China and Russia. The security-focused SCO is also likely to issue a declaration in Qingdao on combating terrorism, which India would welcome, particularly if fellow new member Pakistan faces some additional pressure in cracking down on terror outfits on its soil — a source of consternation not just to India but to other SCO members including China and Russia, and observers such as Afghanistan.

349,Aakash Mehrotra,"Going by the current mood, the  seems to have tolled the death knell for the BJP. The caste arithmetic of the rainbow coalition of the Opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh has once again trumped the BJP's grand old Hindutva rhetoric. If Gorakhpur and Phulpur showed the mettle of the two political frenemies, Kairana bolstered the secular script in the changing political narrative of Uttar Pradesh. Kairana was a strategic victory, it brought the Jat powerhouse of western Uttar Pradesh, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), back in action and proved the hypothesis of Jats returning to the RLD right. If the Muslim vote isn’t splitting and the Jat vote is back in RLD’s fold, well if you were BJP, you couldn’t have woken up to a worse news than this. It implies that Uttar Pradesh is gradually returning to its status quo, the caste arithmetic is back, sides aren’t switching, and that is bad news for Amit Shah. Even when I travelled to Shamli, I heard from common folks that ""Musalman aur Dalit saath hai iss baar, Jats bhi jud jayenge (Muslim and Dalits are together, Jats will also join in)"". The writing on the wall was quite clear. If it was one narrative of change and development that overshadowed all arithmetic in 2014, elections are bound to get more local in 2019. It will be an arithmetic of caste and algebra of local issues, which will set the narrative for 2019. But can this arithmetic alone trump the Modi-Shah duo, who still enjoys favourable ratings because of the unbeatable ground strength of the BJP and its reach through media and WhatsApp groups? The Opposition will need to have more than caste arithmetic to beat the BJP. Even in 2014, the regional parties were able to hold their forts despite the Modi juggernaut. Even the Congress managed to win 20 per cent votes. But the game was changed by the 10 per cent -15 per cent fence-sitters, who will again be the deciding factor in 2019. To get these fence-sitters onto their side, the Opposition parties need to provide a credible alternative. Even for a ""united Opposition"", it will not be easy to take on a political leader who has been taking every criticism head on, and who knows the pulse of the nation better than anyone in the wing.  Modi's posturing as a development man, the ""policy paralysis"" of UPA, and an unprecedented media blitzkrieg, brought in hordes of supporters, especially from the professional middle class.  Cut to 2019, this same class sees its paragon of social and economic liberalism fail, but is this class ready to shift to a medley of political ideologies, most of whom, it sees as corrupt, caste focused politicians? Or will the TINA (there is no alternative) factor set in? The public mood has altered, and the epicentre of the Opposition, the Congress party is still far from revival. All that the Opposition needs is to give the rising middle class is a credible alternative. James Carville famous dictum, that got Bill Clinton the US presidency, defines the alternative to Modi. Modi doesn’t have time to change the script, reforms cannot be ushered in now, his past policies have devastated the markets, inflation is back to haunt us, and fuel prices are artificially inflated. There is no going back. After having already gone on the defensive, can he turn aggressive and reclaim lost political territory?  The country needs answers to set things right — the Opposition, especially the Congress, has its task cut out: It needs to focus on government's delivery record with promises made, and present its own economic policy. And with the ""economy in its tailspin"", the Congress with others need to be going for Modi’s jugular. The Congress needs to present its economic agenda — the pending tax reforms, its solution to the NPA crisis of public banks, alterations to GST, and strategies to heal the manufacturing and SME sector. The Opposition needs to redraw the economic governance agenda. They   haven’t united behind alternative economic solutions that are tangible, easy to understand and capable of inspiring the millennial to vote for them. This is incredible electoral negligence for a party that aspires to take back the House. Modi has lost his credence among farmers, who anyway were never BJP’s core voter base. In order to restore faith among farmers, the Opposition needs its own script to reverse the farm crisis, it needs to move beyond the clichés of farm loan waivers, and present real, workable solutions. Regroup the farmer organisations, initiate conversations and develop an agenda to answer farm crisis. The Opposition will have to talk subtle, comprehensible and workable solutions, moving beyond plain rhetoric and Modi-bashing. India voted for development in 2014. In 2018, it sees the house in disorder, the social cohesion of the country has been trounced. The idea of secularism has been tampered with. And the Opposition is leaving no chance to call out Modi for not reining in the fringe forces, and has populated a credible hypothesis of the ruling class trying to make the fringe, mainstream. Tabassum Hassan, after winning the Kairana by-poll in Uttar Pradesh, credited her victory to the idea of secularism. For a political party with a wide outreach and smart electoral strategies, the BJP has managed to antagonise various sections of the society. First, as expected, the Muslims, then the Dalits, then the farmers. What's more, the traders are unhappy with the GST, a general gloom in the market, parents furious over paper leaks, students angry over SSC exams and a general apathy towards their demands, the working class worried about job losses. And then came the horrific crime in Jammu and Kathua that made even the middle class shed its slumber and stir. But the Opposition cannot just cash in on these disgruntlements , it has to present an alternative — the idea of an empathetic governance and a caring cabinet. In 2014, Modi positioned himself as a man of action and hope. He still seems infallible, a man who can do no wrong. He has created an image for himself as a PM who has been failed by his bureaucrats and ministers, but he is still the man with his heart in the right place. Now compare him with a team of regional leaders, out to defeat not just a man, but an idea called Modi. India, hasn’t forgotten the ""third front"" experiment and the changing prime ministers. Can it afford to go back to those days? The fight against Modi cannot be one personality versus the other. It has to be about issues that have remained unsolved. It has to be about an idea – the idea of representing the interests of different sections, of restoring diversity, of appreciation of dissent, an idea of change, a move towards a different future, which is acceptable to most, if not all Indians.",2018-06-05,"Modi,United Opposition,Kairana by-poll,Lok Sabha polls 2019",United Opposition needs more than just caste arithmetic to beat Modi in 2019,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/lok-sabha-polls-2019-kairana-bypoll-united-opposition-modi-bjp/story/1/24668.html
350,Clyde Crasto,"We all remember the “Minimum Government, Maximum  Governance” slogan, that the BJP promised in the run-up to the 2014 general elections. But the truth is far from what it had promised. A classic example of this is what the  are doing in Maharashtra. They have turned the slogan on its head to “Minimum Governance, Maximum Mind Games”. The Sena and the BJP have been allies for more than two decades in Maharashtra, and in 2014, the Shiv Sena happily surfed the ""Modi Tsunami"" and joined the NDA government at the Centre. All the while, each thought the other won because of its charisma and soon began playing ""mind games"" with each other. The Shiv Sena wanted a few ministerial berths at the Centre, but couldn't extract its pound of flesh. As a result, a lot of drama unfolded during the swearing-in. This is when the games started. During the 2014 Vidhan Sabha elections in Maharashtra, both parties decided to go separate ways to try and prove to each other who among them was the superior. But neither party got a simple majority and to form a government they needed each other again. Since there was no government in place and to hold fresh election would  have meant putting the state and its people under tremendous burden, the NCP  decided to lend unconditional outside support to the BJP to bring stability to Maharashtra. The Sena soon began to get restless realising that it will lose the negotiating power. As the hunger for power got the better of its ego, the Sena joined the BJP government. The BJP, sensing the Sena's desperation, started putting pressure on it from the word go. What followed is nothing short of a soap opera. Every day you would hear the two parties criticising each other and trying to expose each other’s wrongdoings. The Sena keeps saying two things repeatedly as an answer to why it is a part of the government — that the people in large numbers voted for them, and they are playing the role of the Opposition despite being in the government only for the betterment of the state.   This reasoning makes no sense because people voted for Sena as an individual party and not as a coalition partner. There are voters who believe in individual party stands and it betrayed the same people by turning into allies. Secondly, there is an Opposition in place. So, being a part of the government and trying to work as Opposition does not help because you are not improving governance, you are only putting obstacles in   governance. The only argument they keep giving is that the   too fought the elections separately and are now together again. Yes, they did, but the difference is, whether separate then or together now, they never maligned each other. What the BJP and the Shiv Sena did then and are doing now as well is washing their dirty linen in public. In fact, what they are actually doing is throwing more dirt on each other. The recent by-elections in Maharashtra are a proof of how unhappy people are with both Sena and BJP. After the by-poll in Palghar, where the allies contested separately, each of them tried to tell the people what they have achieved. While the BJP celebrated its victory, the Sena said it has increased its vote share. The question is — did the Sena contest the election only to prove that it can increase its vote tally? The answer is, of course, a ""no"". The Sena claimed during the election that it will win. So, such claims of a ""better performance"" are nothing but self-consolation. Interestingly, the drama continues even after the election and they are blaming each other again. The truth is they are hungry for power and playing mind games to prove that one is better than the other. And in doing so they are holding the people of Maharashtra to ransom. They have not been able to fulfil the promises they made to the voters in the run-up to the elections. There are no jobs, farmer suicides are on the rise, demonetisation has failed, fuel prices are at an all-time high and many of their ministers have serious doubts about the party leadership. It must be noted that this drama and mind games are not limited to Maharashtra cabinet alone. It is on display in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as well where they have been allies for more than two decades now. Mumbai and Mumbaikars have been suffering because of this on-going saga of one-upmanship. After all this time, the Shiv Sena says it will go alone in all future elections, come what may. The BJP is trying its best to pacify the Sena, but at its own convenience. The Sena will not walk out of the government as it claims that the people voted for it, and while saying so, it is trying to divert attention from the point that people voted for the Sena as an individual party and not as an ally. But the BJP also needs to answer one pertinent question — why is it continuing an alliance with a party that maligns it every single day? If it doesn't leave you, why don’t you can ask them to go? Well, the fact is, despite the differences, they have one thing in common which binds them together — the ""hunger for power"". So, as long as this hunger exists, the mind games too will continue.",2018-06-05,,"No love lost, why Shiv Sena and BJP are sticking it out",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/maharashtra-2019-sena-bjp-bickering-nda-devendra-fadnavis-uddhav-thackeray-ncp/story/1/24671.html
351,Rahul Noronha,"Madhya Pradesh’s most accomplished political yatri, former CM and AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh — who recently completed a gruelling 3300kms Narmada Parikrama — has embarked on yet another yatra on Thursday. Called the ""Ekta Yatra"", Digvijaya Singh’s latest initiative aims at resolving the differences between Congress leaders right down to the village level before the upcoming assembly elections. On Thursday, the Ekta Yatra was flagged off after Digvijaya Singh, along with nearly a dozen other members of a body called the ""coordination committee"" set up by PCC president Kamal Nath with Digvijaya Singh as its head, went for a darshan at the Ram Raja Temple in Orchha, Madhya Pradesh. The committee has representation from all factions of the Congress. The members of the committee travel in a bus and meet party workers and leaders at pre-selected sites, and also hold public meetings. The coordination committee has some rules too. Those aspiring for tickets are not entertained and slogans hailing a particular Congress leader are not allowed. In a bid to discourage factionalism, only slogans hailing the Congress president Rahul Gandhi and the party are allowed during the course of the yatra. The enduring theme at all pit stops is to forget all differences till the culmination of the 2018 assembly polls and to work jointly against the BJP. On Thursday, the yatra chugged out of Orchha and went to Tikamgarh where a meeting of Congress leaders was held. The yatra then proceeded to Chhatarpur where it would halt for the night. It would then cover other districts of Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand. Digvijaya Singh tweeted on Thursday saying that if all Congressmen unite, the BJP will not stand a chance in MP. How successful will the yatra be in its objectives? Well, if there is anyone who has the ability to convince political rivals within and outside the party, it is Digvijaya Singh. He is the longest-serving Congress CM in the state who managed to keep his government afloat in tumultuous times marked by changes in Congress Presidents, the exiting of his one-time mentor Arjun Singh from the Congress and challenges from the BJP. A minor miracle in Congress politics was achieved on Thursday itself when known Digvijaya Singh baiter, former MP Satyavrat Chaturvedi was present with the former at Orchha. Both spoke of the need for the party men to be united and to single-handedly focus on defeating the well-entrenched BJP. Are these mere photo ops or something deeper is in the offing, will be known in the months to come. Interestingly, certain overtures in keeping with the theme of the yatra were made in the days preceding it. Digvijaya Singh called on Jyotiraditya Scindia at his residence in Delhi. Earlier, Singh’s son, Raghogarh MLA Jai Vardhan Singh invited Scindia for dinner at the Raghogarh fort. Scindia accepted the invitation and said that he was visiting the fort after 15 years. Digvijaya Singh has been constantly reaching out to Scindia after the latter lost out to Kamal Nath in the race for PCC President, in a sequence of events which Congress insiders suggest was engineered by Digvijaya Singh. If there is one thing that rattles the BJP, it is unity in various Congress factions. It is something Congress leaders are aware of and are working towards but the nature of politics is such that keeping personal ambitions in check is not easy. The real challenge will emerge once tickets are announced and the BJP as per its plan, will try and capitalise on these differences.

352,Nikhil Wagle,"It was heartening to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi wish   on his birthday using Twitter, and acknowledging his contribution to Indian democracy. Fernandes is 88 now, bed-ridden for the past few years, and unable to comprehend the developments in Indian politics. But in his prime, he was a livewire. His role in post-independence era is indisputable, for he fought for the common citizenry for nearly five decades. Public memory is short, they say. Sadly, in Fernandes' case it is even shorter. 
 
 Fernandes was my childhood hero. I do not hesitate in saying it even today. His office, famously known as ""204, Charni Road"", or ""Donshe Chaar"" in Marathi, was right opposite my home in Girgaum in Mumbai. It was a typical Marathi middle class-area, not used to labour union offices. I don't know why George decided to set up his first office here. Probably because it was close to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation headquarters. Those days, Fernandes had mobilised a vast union of BMC class IV employees in Mumbai. I was eight or nine years old when I first saw Fernandes, and was awestruck by him. He symbolised hope. A boy from north Karnataka, worked as a hotel worker in Bombay, slept on the streets until P D'mello took him under his wings, and rose to become the most powerful union leader in the financial capital of India. He had more than 1.5 lakh municipal workers, BEST employees and taxi drivers under his control. He could shut Mumbai down with a single call. From the chief minister to the municipal commissioner, Fernandes had the might to take on everyone. He became a national figure overnight after the 1967 Lok Sabha elections. SK Patil, leader of Mumbai Congress, known to be filling party coffers since Jawaharlal Nehru's time, had a reputation of being unbeatable. George overwhelmed him in his own constituency and defeated him with the ease of handling a switch. That was the first of the many victories that earned him the reputation of being a ""giant killer"". For a man with a larger than life personality, Fernandes could even pull off an exaggeration convincingly with the public. I have met him several times, and experienced the euphoria he generated among the people. Even during the twilight of his career, in the 1990s, I have seen a packed Shivaji Park going crazy over him. It happened during a union rally. Sharad Rao and several other leaders delivered their speeches, but Fernandes couldn't be seen anywhere. After a while, he made a heroic entry, where he walked towards the stage through the crowd that went berserk. He had won the rally even before he started to speak. During his initial days in Mumbai, he earned the respect and love of the people because he was genuinely involved with people's issues, and not a façade to gain popularity. He had gone down on railway tracks to stop the trains during the 1974 railway strike. He had the fire in the belly, and people were smitten by it. He faced police torture for it, but it only intensified his fighting spirit. Fernandes, therefore, was a natural face to fight Indira Gandhi's Emergency. He was arrested for hatching the Baroda Dynamite Conspiracy, which he had organised to throw out Indira's government. When asked whether such violent means are justified to save democracy, he said, ""Anything is justified to save democracy."" He spent the entire period of Emergency in jail, and was not even released during the historic 1977 Lok Sabha elections. But he fought from jail, and won the Muzaffarpur constituency by a landslide. The fact that he could pull off such a thing despite being in jail added insult to injury for Indira Gandhi, and she hated him. He was the poster boy of Janata Party, and his chained photograph had become a household image. Fernandes reluctantly became a minister in the Janata Party cabinet. But he took charge of the ministry of industry, and took no time to leave a socialist stamp on it by banning Coke. We probably can't comprehend the importance of the decision in the liberal world, but in 1977, taking on an international giant was a bold move. That, in effect, enabled the birth of Thumbs Up in India. In VP Singh's cabinet in 1989, he marked his legacy as railways minister by introducing the historic Konkan Railway, along with the then finance minister Madhu Dandavate. I tweeted in the morning that not many remember Fernandes today. 
 
 But a user quickly responded, ""Those who travel by Kokan Railway do."" As defence minister in Vajpayee cabinet, he was equally popular among the lower ranks of the Indian Army as he responded to their needs. When the Janata Party split, Fernandes' downfall began. He backed the Morarji Desai government and defected to the rebel camp the next day, which cost him his hard earned credibility. And post Mandal, he could not find his space in India politics. He never had a devoted vote bank like Lalu Yadav. He always banked on his popularity, whether in Mumbai or, later, in Bihar. He was a Christian who rarely played the minority card. He spoke seven languages and was a true product of inclusive India. The likes of Nitish or Lalu could not afford a leader like Fernandes overshadowing them in Bihar. To sustain his relevance in national politics, he drifted towards the BJP. His relationship with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani was excellent, but the move turned out to be the last nail in the coffin of his credibility. After the 2002 riots in Gujarat, he ended up defending Narendra Modi and that was the culmination of a tragedy. It was a great fall from grace for a leader who had represented international human rights organisations in India. Unfortunately, the last few years of political hara-kiri have overshadowed his electrifying career and the essential people-centric role he played in the post-independence era. Fernandes' story is one of tragedy. Nonetheless, he certainly deserves an objective biography or a biopic. After all, Vajpayee was not the only right man caught in the wrong company.

353,Rajarshi Gupta,"Sunil Chhetri, India's football captain, is in august company. After his hat-trick against Chinese Taipei, Chhetri moved to third in the goal-scoring list for active international footballers behind  . On June 4, when India take on Kenya in the , he will become only the second Indian to play 100 internationals. For well over a decade since his international debut in 2005, Chhetri has been Indian football's poster boy. In short, Chhetri is a sporting legend in a country which hero-worships its cricket stars, accords them demigod status and swoons over their carefully cultivated personas. Chhetri, by the sheer dint of his record, should hold the same place as Virat Kohli does in the Indian sporting spectrum. Well, he should but he doesn't. For if he had, there would have been no need for one of world football's most prolific scorers to plead with his countrymen to come watch him and his mates play. 
 
 India's football captain, their highest goal-scorer made an emotional plea: ""To all of you, who have lost hope and do not have any hope in Indian football, I request you to come and watch us in the stadiums."" ""It is not fun to criticise or abuse on the internet. Come to the stadium, do it on our face, scream at us, shout at us, abuse us and who knows, one day we might change you guys. You might start cheering for us."" It was a two-minute, 20-second clip but Chhetri said enough for India's sporting fans to contemplate how they want to treat their stars. It was an impassioned plea to a generation which loves watching European football. There was plenty of chatter on social media when Real Madrid annhilated Liverpool in the Champions League final and there is always plenty of chatter when Jose Mourinho puts his foot in the mouth all too frequently. But who talks about Indian football? The Indian team is in Mumbai for a tournament that may not mean much to world football. There are no media rights, no high-profile advertisers, there is none of the charisma of big-ticket players and the high-octane game that the world has come to love. Yet, there is determination. There's a fire burning inside each of those men who are slogging it out in the oppressive heat of Mumbai. The FIFA World Cup, just days away, will capture the imagination of the entire world including India's but we will continue to ignore our own. Frankly, who cares what India, Chinese Taipei, Kenya and New Zealand do on a football pitch? Would you not much rather cherish Manchester City's crowning moment or Zinedine Zidane's sensational decision to step down as Real Madrid coach? What happens to Bale? Will Ronaldo stay back in Madrid? Oh, the burden of those thoughts could cripple you! Stop for a moment to spare a thought for Chhetri's men — they are playing for you, for every Indian. There's not much money to be made, there is no queue of endorsers and TV media rights aren't the most tempting but it is still an Indian team. And this Indian team deserves as much respect as the cricketers, shuttlers and shooters. Chhetri happens to command the Indian national football team and he is a star! A little over 2,000 people turned up to watch India take on Chinese Taipei. Where's the love? Not long after Chhetri's video went viral, Virat Kohli threw in his weight. ""I want to request everyone to go watch the Indian football team play,"" he said. After singing paeans to the Indian football team, Kohli spoke of his vision for a sporting India and urged his fans to show some compassion. ""Have compassion, think of how they are representing our nation,"" the batting superstar said. Compassion? Our footballers do not need that. They need more respect, they need more support surely but compassion? Why does it need a Kohli or a Tendulkar to come out and ask people to go watch football? So, will you only go to football grounds because your cricketing heroes ask you to? Imagine, Chhetri urging Indian fans to go watch India play a T20 International in Hyderabad. It's a pity. It's outright pity. But it is not just about the fans, really. The four-nation tournament in Mumbai should have been organised better. Where does the AIFF figure in this? They need to be more proactive. The matches are being telecast on the same channel that brought you pictures from the IPL. Yet, how many had an inkling that a football tournament would be held days after the richest T20 league in the world. It was heartbreaking to see Chhetri pleading with fans to watch them play. The issue is far bigger though. Will a packed house watch India take on Kenya Monday? Will Chhetri sweep young fans off their feet like Kohli does? Will Chhetri's words matter as much as Kohli's does? At least, Chhetri's impassioned plea is a slap on our faces. It is a wake-up call and while it may not change the fortunes and following of Indian football overnight, it has given all of us some food for thought. Meanwhile, as we chew on some food for thought, how about some more: could we not have done with our cricketers' patronising comments on Indian footballers?",2018-06-04,"Cricket,Football,Sunil Chhetri",It’s a pity Sunil Chhetri's wake-up call for India needs Virat Kohli’s approval,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sunil-chhetri-plea-for-indian-football-shame-intercontinental-cup-fifa-world-cup/story/1/24641.html
354,Anand Kochukudy,"The result of the Kairana by-election, along with the by-poll results across the country today, clearly establishes the theory that only a   can trounce the BJP led by Narendra Modi. Although the numbers favoured the Opposition, the BJP put its best foot forward as always in Kairana. If Gorakhpur and Phulpur losses were bad enough, on the home turf of chief minister   and the seat vacated by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, this loss will sting the BJP even more. In an unprecedented move, even the prime minister had landed up in adjacent Baghpat with a bounty of promises a couple of days before the poll. It was ostensibly to inaugurate a portion of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, but clearly intended to circumvent the Election Commission’s model code of conduct. It seems the law of diminishing returns has caught up with Narendra Modi as he battles anti-incumbency. With the farmers in Kairana facing the dual issue of sugarcane arrears from sugar mills and the hike in electricity rates by the Yogi Adityanath government, the slogan coined by Jayant Chaudhary —  “Jinnah nahi Ganna"" — resonated with the electorate and the BJP’s attempts at polarisation came a cropper. While the opposition can definitely take heart in this win, they should take their lessons from this victory and stick together in 2019 with this template of give and take. The BJP was always up against it in Kairana as the arithmetic clearly favoured the Opposition. The Opposition — the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal in particular — was smart with their strategy of candidate selection. With Ajit Singh-led Rashtriya Lok Dal wiped out of Uttar Pradesh’s electoral map after 2014, it was important for the Jat party’s survival that they had some representation. While Jayant Chaudhary himself was priming to contest initially, he was successfully persuaded by Akhilesh Yadav to put up Samajwadi party’s Tabassum Begum on an RLD ticket. Tabassum Hasan, widow of the late Munawar Hasan, comes from a political family and has represented this constituency from 2009-2014 as a representative of the BSP. Just as he put up Nishad Party chief Sanjay Nishad’s son Praveen Nishad on a Samajwadi ticket in Gorakhpur, this accommodative approach paid dividends and she was possibly the best candidate in the current circumstances. Tabassum Hasan’s candidature itself was half the battle won as she had the backing of all the Opposition parties even if BJP’s Hukum Singh had romped home with over 50 per cent vote share in 2014 on the back of the Modi wave and riding on religious polarisation. Hasan’s candidature also went some way in healing the deep wounds inflicted by the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013, as reconciliation between the Jats and Muslims was put to electoral test. While the BSP and the Congress backed the candidate despite some hiccups along the way, the demography of the area was also stacked heavily in favour of the Opposition. The BJP did try their best to scrape through with multi-pronged strategies. While candidate Mriganka Singh refused to campaign on divisive issues, the organisation backing her did their best to polarise the situation on the ground. The BJP campaign in-charge Sanjiv Balyan and CM   repeatedly referred to these issues as late as a week ago. However, the Jats and even a sizeable number of Hindu Gujjars (the community Mriganka Singh hails from) had put these issues behind them as they struggled with bread and butter issues and stagnating income, of late. With Uttar Pradesh being the bellwether and swing state, this result comes as a huge setback for the BJP. Apart from Palghar — where the Opposition votes split — and an Assembly seat in Uttarakhand, BJP’s performance across the 10 states has been abysmal. Therein lies the biggest takeaway for the Opposition. Apart from the diminishing returns of Narendra Modi’s campaigning and anti-incumbency, farm distress and rising fuel prices have also contributed to BJP’s woes. With more fence-sitters like TDP’s Chandrababu Naidu joining the Opposition ranks, the BJP will have to go back to the drawing board. The success of the RJD in Bihar against the JD(U)-BJP alliance and the huge margin of the victory might also prompt the Nitish Kumars and the Ram Vilas Paswans for a rethink. As for the major Opposition parties, maintaining unity while keeping individual ambitions in check will be the biggest challenge as they go into 2019. By sheer numbers alone, they start as the favourites. But rather than being complacent, they should now try to align with each other on various issues and build synergy to convert the general election into a localised one in their respective states. Amit Shah has a rabbit up his sleeve and has devised a strategy to execute a three-way split of the OBC sub-quota in Uttar Pradesh — but that may still end up short. This result might also force the BJP for a rethink on advancing the general election to this winter as they battle heavy anti-incumbency in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. With no elections scheduled for a few months, it will be interesting to see if there are political re-alignments among the Opposition parties as they prepare for the general elections.  ",2018-05-31,"Sp-rld,Yogi Adityanath,BJP,Kairana by-poll",How Kairana by-poll result could be a bellwether for 2019 Lok Sabha elections,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kairana-noorpur-uttar-pradesh-bypolls-bjp-yogi-adityanath-samajwadi-party-rld-bsp-keshav-maurya/story/1/24576.html
355,Amitabh Srivastava ,"Lalu Prasad Yadav’s Rashtriya Janata Dal on Thursday (May 31) registered a huge moral victory by wresting the  from the ruling Janata Dal (United) in the by-election. Already the single largest party in the Bihar Assembly, the RJD now has 81 legislators in the 243-member Assembly. (The JD(U) has 70 MLAs, RJD ally Congress 27 and JD(U) ally BJP has 53 legislators.) The by-poll was necessitated after the seat fell vacant in March this year following sitting JD(U) legislator  successfully contest the by-poll for Araria Lok Sabha seat, which had fallen vacant after the death of his father and sitting MP, Taslimuddin. In Jokihat, the RJD had fielded Sarfaraz Alam’s younger brother Shahnawaz Alam, who defeated JD(U) candidate Murshid Alam by more than 40,000 votes. The poll outcome has further cemented the RJD’s Muslim-Yadav vote base. Of the 2.70 lakh voters in the Assembly segment, around 1.75 lakh voters are Muslims. Though not much appears to have changed after the results were announced as the ruling JD(U)-BJP-LJP alliance still has a simple majority in Bihar Assembly, a deeper look surely reveals worrying signs for the Nitish Kumar-led alliance in Bihar. Unlike the March 2018 by-polls, when the NDA could not wrest Jehanabad Assembly and Araria Lok Sabha seats from the RJD, they still had the consolation that these two were not their sitting seats. But Jokihat was a seat held by the ruling JD(U), which the party had won in 2010 and 2015, which is why the poll outcome is of huge symbolic value. The major takeaway from the poll outcome is that the result has not only robbed the NDA of its perceived invincibility tag and placed young Tejashwi Yadav as a leader in his own right, it also proved that Lalu Prasad, currently on bail on medical grounds and not involved in direct political activities, still remains an electoral force. From 2005 to 2013, when Nitish Kumar ran a coalition government with the BJP in Bihar, the two parties had a fully synchronised coordination mechanism, which helped them sweep the 2009 Lok Sabha and the 2010 Assembly polls in Bihar. The invincible electoral structure came undone in June 2013 when Nitish moved away from the BJP, and the two parties failed to resurrect it even after  with the saffron party. The proof of it is clearly reflected in the by-poll results in Bihar. With its defeat in Jokihat, the ruling NDA has lost three out of the four seats (three Assembly and one Lok Sabha) that have witnessed by-poll in Bihar, after Nitish Kumar dumped the grand alliance and joined hands with the BJP to form an alternative government in July 2017. In March this year, when Bihar witnessed by-polls for two Assembly and one Lok Sabha seats, the poll outcome had backed status quo, with RJD retaining Jehanabad Assembly and Araria Lok Sabha seat while the BJP held on to its Bhabhua Assembly seat. The March by-polls were the first elections held in Bihar after Nitish Kumar snapped ties with the mahagathbandhan. The Jokihat result has further placed the RJD head and shoulders above the rest in Bihar. “Prior to 2013, when the Nitish-BJP magic worked wonderfully in Bihar, the  to have ebbed and he was being seen as a leader of just Muslims and Yadavs. But after his successive convictions in fodder scam case, coupled with the emergence of Tejashwi as a worthy successor, the RJD appears to be riding a sympathy wave that has regenerated Lalu's image as a messiah of the poor who has been victimised,"" said a senior RJD leader. The defeat, however, is not of Nitish alone, as the BJP too clearly failed to galvanise its traditional supporters among traders who are said to be unhappy about the GST. The middle class, too, have developed cold feet over rising prices.

356,Colonel Vivek Chadha,"On May 28, 2018, the director generals of military operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan spoke to each other and   that had first been inked in 2003. The two sides underlined the need for peace along the LoC and the importance of avoiding civilian casualties. According to the statement, released by the ministry of defence in India, the “Indian Army DGMO agreed with the proposal to undertake sincere measures to improve the existing situation to ensure peace and avoidance of hardships to the civilians along the borders.” This suggested that Pakistan had initiated the proposal and indicated its desire to restore peace along the LoC. On the face of it, the proposal and its acceptance appear to be the right decision and must receive the support from all peace-loving citizens on both sides of the border. This is indeed the case, if peace returns not only along the LoC, but extends beyond to areas where the terrorists continue with their violent activities. This suggests that any future course of action by India must relate to a clear understanding of why Pakistan is keen to seek a ceasefire and what could be its implications in future? The best case scenario is that there has been a change of heart in Rawalpindi and Pakistan, given the increasing international pressure in seeking a tactical pause. Conversely, it is more likely that the cost-benefit calculation by the Pakistani army suggests that seeking a ceasefire emerges as the best option, at least in the immediate future. The former seems improbable, given the absence of any indicators of the same. Therefore, in all likelihood, it is the latter that seems to be the basis for Pakistan’s desire to press for a ceasefire. The reasons for it are not difficult to assess. The only segment of the Pakistan society that matters in relation to India’s policy of robust activism along the LoC is the Pakistan army (It is the only institution that matters even beyond the LoC!). The Indian Army’s LoC policy has resulted in substantial damage, including heavy casualties to the Pakistani soldiers deployed. Therefore, for Pakistan it is the best to establish peace along the LoC, thereby safeguarding its soldiers, even as   in J&K. This was exactly what Pakistan had achieved after 2003 and it continued since, with intermittent levels of violence at the hands of terrorists in J&K. If war is an unlikely option for both the countries and terrorism continues to bleed India, then Pakistan succeeds in its objective of employing a loss-cost option by sending brainwashed terrorists, whose life and employability remains the least of concerns for Pakistan. India, on the other hand, is forced to remain content with retaining relative peace along the LoC, at the cost of accepting casualties beyond. It is difficult to comprehend what can possibly be worse for India, especially in the light of thousands of   during the last 30 years. The initiative in such a scenario remains perpetually with Pakistan, as does the advantage. Under these circumstances, it is not difficult to see why Pakistan wants a ceasefire along the LoC, even as its machinations continue unabated in J&K and beyond. If these circumstances dictate the ceasefire, then India’s acceptance of the same must remain conditional to Pakistan reining in its state policy of employing terrorism against India. There should be no doubt or misgivings in the minds of terror merchants at Rawalpindi that any sponsored terrorist strike in the hinterland will be seen as a direct violation of the ceasefire by Pakistan. And such a violation will be responded to by India not only at the time and place of choosing, but also with the intensity that is deemed appropriate. India must remain committed to peace along the LoC, only if that is acceptable to Pakistan. The ceasefire is an incentive for not only the letter, but also the spirit of the arrangement agreed upon by the two sides. The spirit of this agreement includes the acts of terrorism by Pakistan inside India. And the punishment for terrorism should be swift and resounding, the echoes of which must clearly be heard in Rawalpindi.",2018-06-01,"Terrorism,India-Pakistan,Jk,Ceasefire","India should agree to Pakistan's ceasefire proposal, but only on one condition",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/loc-ceasefire-india-pakistan-dgmos-army-casualties-pak-sponsored-terrorism-us-pressure/story/1/24581.html
357,Brig SK Chatterji (retd),"In April, the central government announced the creation of a  (DPC) that includes the top military leadership and is chaired by the national security adviser. The DPC also includes the defence secretary, foreign secretary and, notably, the revenue secretary. The Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff ( HQ IDS) is to serve as its secretariat. Among the major tasks of the  and strategic defence review and doctrines. It will also chalk out the international defence engagement strategy, plan to boost defence exports and prioritised capability development for the armed forces. The committee will have four sub-committees to perform all its tasks. A few questions come up for deliberations. The committee will be served by the HQ IDS, which was expected to ultimately pave the way for the appointment of a chief of defence staff (CDS). The CDS is considered extremely important for joint-operation of three services, as would invariably be required should we have to go to war. The moot question is: Is the DPC the endgame for and state burial of the concept of a CDS? The Kargil Review Committee report that was constituted in the aftermath of a bitter campaign, opted for a CDS. The recommendations were made immediately after a bloody and bitter conflict. Such circumstances serve to highlight the military needs lucidly and spur a more candid approach to issues. The more recent Shekatkar Committee also upheld the requirement of a CDS. The issues that have been entrusted to the DPC doesn’t and cannot address all areas that a CDS would be required to address. Shouldn’t CDS have been the priority rather than another committee? An omission in the committee is the home secretary. The formulation of a national security doctrine requires inputs on internal security. Leaving out the home secretary is obviously not the expected course. The other view is if we have too many members, the amalgam will slow its progress. If the DPC is to move at a pace that is required of it, a lean structure promises higher payoffs. The big advantage of having a DPC is drawing the core officials concerned on to the same table, of course the home secretary apart. So far, defence planning has been undertaken in a relative void with the doctrinal and review aspects not being stated by the government. The plans have been based on assumptions by the military itself. With the DPC formulating the doctrinal aspects, military planners will have the requisite guidelines from the government. We have also not laid out our objectives in different threat scenarios that pan the spectrum from a single front to two-and-a-half front simultaneous threat. The only objective that the nation has heard of is the rhetoric: we will not accept the loss of an inch of our land (never mind the levels of threat). Such objectives are, of course, militarily unattainable and cannot serve as planning parameters. With a DPC in place these ambiguities will give way to clearer directions. The issue of CDS crops up repeatedly when the newly formed DPC is discussed. The concept of CDS also implied that the political leadership gets its inputs directly from the man who strategises operational planning, employment of military resources and is accountable for both force readiness and achieving politico-military objectives of war. With a CDS not yet in place, do the services have a chance of reaching out to the prime minister through a faster channel – the DPC? As per the directive, the DPC would be forwarding its reports to the defence minister. The current national security adviser enjoys the PM’s trust and it can be definitely be stated that future NSAs too will have the same rapport with their PM, since they would also be appointed by the PM. However, the flip side of the story throws up a question: would the raksha mantri be losing influence in the bargain? The ministry of defence bureaucracy will certainly have to increase its pace in decision-making instead of endless comments and notings on file. We have had defence ministers in the past who have spent their time apparently more in a meditative state rather than applying themselves to military capability-building. With a DPC in place, if they delay their processing, the issues could reach the PM through the NSA, as they are caught flat-footed. The formation of the DPC would be considered a milestone achievement should it be able to produce the strategic documents that it has been tasked to. These have also to be produced in an acceptable time frame, something that the agency needs to publically announce. The role of the expenditure secretary would be very crucial. The need to give equal importance  to both growth and security of the nation is an imperative that both our political leadership and senior bureaucracy has to perceive. Finally, the need for creation of the CDS is not necessarily influenced by the DPC. Even if we were to get our doctrines, military diplomacy, defence production and exports and capability development right, the rejuvenated forces will need to come together to win a war — something that only a CDS can bring in. A lot depends on how the DPC is led. The current NSA has been instrumental in the display of our national resolve to both our western and northern neighbours, the surgical strikes and Doklam standoff being examples. Should we want to strengthen this resolve with hard military power, a CDS is required. In fact, the DPC perhaps provides an opportunity to pursue the case for a CDS to be pursued more strongly.",2018-05-31,"Modi government,Defence Ministry,Chief of defence staff,Defence Planning Committee",Defence Planning Committee is not enough to fight security challenges.

358,Aroon Purie,"Exactly a year from today, a new government will be in place in New Delhi, and the inaugural session of the 17th Lok Sabha will be under way. A year might  seem like a long time, but not for the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo who have changed the rules of the electoral game quite in the way T-20 has done in cricket. I don’t recall any other government that has been so proactive in launching reforms or schemes. Not all of them have worked out as intended, but in the last four years there has been a relentless effort to bring about change. There is also a method in the madness where most schemes are connected to each other. The massive drive to open  , for example, was linked to the direct benefit transfers that plugged all illegal leakage. The push for skilling was connected with the Make in India campaign. Even demonetisation was preceded by many schemes for people to declare their black money. For making these attempts, the Modi government deserves kudos. We have ranked the Modi government every year since 2014. Our current issue, the last annual assessment before the 2019 general elections, analyses the achievements of this government over the past four years. What we have discovered is that there have been tremendous achievements, on some very important fronts — infrastructure, economy and foreign relations. If there is anything that will save this government, it is the pace of construction of roads, development of ports and waterways. It has kickstarted projects held up for years and provided much-needed employment. The economy grew at an average of 7.3 per cent over the past four years with an inflation rate of 3.6 per cent last fiscal. The  that have been festering for years have been brought out into the open. New legislation, such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, has made it easier for indebted firms to be sold. Direct benefit transfers to the needy have been a great success. Corruption at top levels in the government is virtually unheard of and the expansion of the income tax-paying base can only be good news. However, there are glaring lapses in several other areas. The government’s Make in India mission to boost domestic manufacturing and spur job creation has not taken off. Although there is a dispute about employment figures, you cannot have an economy growing at 6.6 per cent and no new jobs. Foreign investment proposals dropped to Rs 8 lakh crore last year, more than half of what they had been in the preceding two years. Exports fell 3.7 per cent every year from 2015 onwards, with the manufacturing sector still reeling under the aftershocks of demonetisation and the transition to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) while industrial production slowed to a five-month low of 4.4 per cent in March this year. In the social sector, too, it fares poorly, with no sign of the new education policy or any serious attempts to upgrade the quality of education. The National Health Protection Scheme, set to be rolled out later this year, could be a game-changer in the health sector, though. The Modi government’s campaign pitch for Election 2019, launched on its fourth anniversary, is "" "" — good intention and right development. A clever slogan that makes up for any shortfall in expectations. These are the twin planks on which the BJP has positioned itself as the party with a difference ahead of 2019. Fears of the government taking a right turn and appealing to narrow parochial and religious considerations seem unfounded for now. Development, the plank on which the Modi government swept to power in 2014, with the first majority in three decades, still seems to be front and centre on its agenda. Going by their new slogan, the government cannot be faulted on good intentions. But governance is never just about good intentions. It is about delivery. And what we’ve seen is that many of the well-intentioned schemes failed because of a slothful bureaucracy and the poor bench strength of the Modi cabinet. Four years later, these unreformed areas continue to be a drag on the government, impacting the performance of its key electoral promises. I have now given up hope that this government will deliver on its election promise of ""minimum government, maximum governance"". We are now resigned to living under a regime that is over-reliant on a bloated public sector and bureaucracy, combined with what I call Swadeshi Socialism. Despite these and the recent shock of high oil prices, the economy is projected to grow at over 7 per cent, the highest for a large economy. This, as it heads into an election year where it is very likely to face a united opposition, but one which has yet to come up with a coherent alternative narrative to the one offered by Modi. There is talk of the government hoping to win on the   — factor, but that would be unfortunate indeed. Governments need to win elections on the strength of their achievements, not because there is no alternative.

359,Mohan Guruswamy,"On May 30, Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again tried to cover up the failure of his government in spurring growth by making false claims. Modi told the nation that ""loans worth Rs 6 lakh crore have been given to 12 million beneficiaries under the  "" and accused the previous government of tokenism. 
 
 This is artful lying at its best — or worst. It is a huge fib. It reminds me of the Celtic tale ""How the little Wren became the King of all Birds"". It is about a clever wren, who inveigled an eagle into a contest that it won by bluffing the eagle. The wren engages the eagle into a contest of who can fly the highest and then rides on the eagle's back asking it to go higher and higher. When the eagle could go no higher, the wren jumps off its back and claims victory. Our prime minister is like that wren. Very clever and very opportunistic, but not quite honest. Modi blows his own trumpet over his achievements. Take for instance electrification the case of rural electrification. As per the 2001 Census, there are a total of 5,97,464 inhabited villages in India. Out of which, 5,71,168 villages were electrified as on April 30, 2014. Villages in all Union Territories were 100 per cent electrified with the exception of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which is only 77.8 per cent electrified. A few major states such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Kerala, Punjab and Tamil Nadu had 100 per cent villages electrified. Only 10 states Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Orissa, Rajasthan and Andaman and Nicobar Islands were below the national average of 95.6 per cent in April 2014. When the remote village of   in Manipur was electrified, the last of the 18,458 villages without electricity was connected. This final 4.6 per cent what was achieved by the Modi regime. But Modi claimed that his government has achieved 100 per cent electrification. There was no mention that when India became independent only 1,500 villages had power connections. It was another case of the wren hopping off the eagles back and claiming it had flown higher when it was the eagle that flew the wren high. While technically it was the Modi government that could claim credit for 100 per cent electrification, we do know who did all the ground work by building the great power generation capacity and building nationwide power grid. To keep repeating ad nauseam that nothing was done till he took over is just being too clever by half. But Modi is the master of the art of fib. Even Modi's claim of 100 per cent electrification doesn't mean all households have electricity. As per the Union power ministry's definition, a village is deemed electrified if at least 10 per cent of the households in it have power connections and if electricity is provided in public places such as schools, panchayat offices, health centres and community centres. This is why even though 100 per cent electrification of villages has been achieved, government data shows that approximately 31 million households continue to live without electricity. The houses without electricity by and large are homes of the officially poor like marginal farmers and rural workers. If they get a decent income, which means regular and meaningful livelihoods, they too will get electric connections. This is where job creation matters. A subject the prime minister would like to obfuscate, given his government's sad record. Now let us get back to the Mudra finance scheme, which is nothing but all the old schemes operational under the banking system given a common name. It's not new wine in new bottles. It's not even new wine in old bottles. It just the same old wine in the same old bottles. Only now all the bottles have a new label — Mudra. The Mudra website shows that Rs 5 trillion has been disbursed by banks, micro-finance companies and non-banking financial companies since the inception of the scheme. Indeed, it is easy to measure the success of the scheme through disbursals of loans but lenders have historically been giving out small loans anyway. Given that the business model of micro-lenders is to give such loans, the branding of Mudra as a special scheme is essentially dishonest. The utility of the Mudra scheme can only be measured by the refinance support that the Mudra agency extends to such disbursals. The progress here is hardly impressive. The outstanding refinance provided by the government as of March 2017 was just Rs 6,114 crore or less than 2 per cent of the cumulative disbursals. 
 
 For 2018-19, refinance provided during the current year is just Rs 633 crore suggesting that the scheme has begun tapering off. That Mudra has created 30 or 50 or 70 million new jobs is a lie. About 450 million people are employed in the informal sector in India. Close to 81 per cent of all employed persons in India make a living by working in the informal sector, with only 6.5 per cent in the formal sector and 0.8 per cent in the household sector. The low household employment itself suggests the Mudra loans have not had the desired penetration. Bangladesh by contrast has 13.5 per cent employment in the household sector. To get a better idea about how credit to the poor is faring one has to just look at the numbers provided by the Reserve Bank of India. The credit/deposit ratio for the rural population increased from 41 per cent in 1999 to 66.9 per cent in 2016. It has stagnated since then. The share of small borrowers (borrowing less than Rs 2 lakh) has been falling under the Modi regime. The share of small loan accounts has been dropping steadily for over a decade and there is no sign of it moving upwards. As of now, small loans account for just 0.4 per cent of the outstanding loans, and 0.8 per cent of the number of accounts. Since 2008, the credit/deposit ratio of rural India has been dropping, suggesting the flight of capital from Bharat to India continues unabated. As a matter of fact, the credit/deposit ratio for metropolitan India has been increasing and is now up by 10 per cent since 2000 when it was 0.70. One consequence of this is that now two out of three poor take credit from informal sources. One clear policy suggestion from this is that farm loan waivers don't help poor farmers. It is mostly the politically active middle and large farmers who benefit from this, and they are less than 15 per cent of all farmers. So Modiji, stop flying on the eagles back and learn to fly on your own. And stop fibbing.

360,Romita Datta,"It was a week of huge surprises. After the grand show of Opposition unity in Karnataka, it was evident that PM Narendra Modi and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee would not be comfortable in each other’s company. But what one witnessed later, at Santiniketan, belied all apprehensions. The bonhomie on stage and on the sidelines showed an entirely different equation between the two leaders. Banerjee received Modi, greeted him with an uttariya and yellow flowers. Modi, who was standing afar with party leaders from Bengal, walked several steps forward when he saw Banerjee ready to greet him. There was slush and mud on the helipad, and Modi gestured to Banerjee to watch her step. And, while inaugurating Bangladesh Bhavan at Santiniketan, Modi asked Banerjee to come and join him and Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina for a photo opportunity when photographers focussed on the two PMs unveiling the plaque. Banerjee, too, helped Modi come in the picture frame when Governor Kesri Nath Tripathi came in between and blocked the Prime Minister. With a slight nudge, she made Tripathi shift a little so that they all could be seen clearly. However, just a day or two ago, Banerjee had blasted Modi for fuel price, and for holding back on Deshikottam awards just because one of her party intellectuals was on the list. Even the day before Modi set foot on Bengal, Banerjee was his strongest critic. The tension was palpable in the air as flags of two political parties kept fluttering in Shantiniketan. A smiling Banerjee was towering over the city, while the BJP arranged a team of leaders and truckloads of supporters to Shantiniketan to cheer for their heavyweight leader. People were expecting a showdown, literally a face-off, but what actually happened was that Modi and Banerjee met like friends, not as foes. Political pundits were talking of political courtesy and compulsion of a regional satrap, but what was clearly amiss was animosity between the two. It was unbelievable that just two days ago, Banerjee had ganged up with all the Opposition leaders against PM Modi. Now, with their recent bonhomie, the Left parties got yet another opportunity to back their premonition of a Modi-Didi understanding. In fact, a few weeks ago, Banerjee had attended an event to celebrate Gandhiji’s 150th birth centenary, which was chaired by Modi. And then when Modi had strong words to say against the atrocities of the ruling party in the panchayat polls, Banerjee refrained from countering the PM personally. Instead, she blamed the state BJP leaders for misinforming him. So what is going between the two? Is it shadow boxing? In the last six months or so, Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress did not participate in the major political issues the UPA took to embarrass the government on the floor of Parliament. Neither was it a signatory to the chief justice of India’s impeachment motion nor did it participate in the no-confidence motion, though Banerjee flexed her muscles against the NDA and Modi in political rallies and on social media. “It is nothing but a strategy to polarise the vote-bank and help the BJP and her party get maximum number of seats based on religious division,” said CPI(M) state leader Rabin Deb. “If she has been serious on her intent, many of her leaders would have been picked up by the CBI,” added the same leader. Although BJP national leader Kailash Vijayvargiya has thundered in the wake of panchayat polls that many state ministers would soon be in jail, it was nothing more than a hollow threat. There has been a perceivable lull on CBI and ED investigations for close to a month. Summons are not being sent and no political person is being hauled up. The BJP is also not prepared to antagonise Banerjee and give her a chance to be serious about any issues against Modi. With the NDA looking to lose many seats in 2019 general elections, the BJP is scouting for new allies, or may we say friends-in-guise-of-foes, to keep its ship sailing. The idea of a Federal Front, or an alternative platform against the NDA that is independent of the UPA, is nothing but giving more power, energy and strength to the saffron brigade. The more the division of anti-incumbency votes, the better it is for the incumbent. The picture is confusing. The lines of friends and foes are blurred. BSP chief Mayawati has already spelled out the fear that she expects some kind of raw deal from the Samajwadi Party in the event of a mahagathbandhan. The Trinamool Congress has floated a ""one-is-to-one"" formula, which is unacceptable to the Congress. Permutation and combination are going on, and amid this foggy environment what emerges clear are pictures of two faces with cheek-to-cheek grins, with no grouse and grudge.

361,Anand Kochukudy,"As I learned about the news of mass EVM malfunctioning coming in from the   since early morning on May 28, I decided to visit the constituency to find out more about it firsthand. The election had become the centre of attention owing to the high-stakes contest between BJP’s Mriganka Singh and the joint opposition candidate, Tabassum Hasan, representing the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and backed by the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress. I took the fastest route via Samalkha on Grand Trunk Road and upon reaching the Uttar Pradesh border after crossing the parched Yamuna River, I saw the UP Police halting vehicles at their checkpost at the border, inspecting the trunks and jotting down the number of vehicles entering Kairana from Haryana. After spending a few minutes at the bustling BJP office bang in the centre of the town and chatting up with the local reporters (the trick is to network with reporters of local channels than the folks from Delhi) to get a pulse of the situation, I decided to visit as many polling booths as I could on the list put out by Opposition candidate Begum Hasan where polling was supposedly interrupted. As I am quite familiar with the topography of the place, having been a regular visitor to the place from 2013, I quickly covered all the four polling stations in the vicinity. Although the six polling booths (numbering 225 to 231 in Kairana) at the polling station in Public Inter College in the town premises were not part of the list put out, I discovered that there was an interruption in voting at 9.40am. To my surprise, I also learned that when polling was halted in one booth inside this station, voting got completely affected in all the other booths as well. To make sure I wasn’t being the fed wrong information, I spoke to as many people as I could, including the policemen on duty; all of them concurred even though the timeframe between the disruption and resumption varied slightly in different accounts. I still haven’t figured out why polling stopped at all booths in a station if the EVM or Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines malfunctioned in a particular booth. After this, I drove to Bhura village near Kairana when I got information that some altercation between the residents and the police — culminating in a round of firing in the air — had taken place. I saw a huge posse of the UP Police camped there and an agitated crowd of people outside the polling station located in a college. A man had supposedly been seriously injured and was on his way to Shamli while another person showed drops of blood on his white kurta. They also pointed to a damaged charpoy and asked me to film it and show it on TV, assuming I was representing some TV channel. The altercation was the result of some polling official allegedly misbehaving with a woman voter, asking her to reveal her face and grabbing her arm in the process. It is a Gujjar-dominated village and the woman was supposedly covering her face in ""ghoonghat"". Curiously, the senior police officers refused to admit there was a round of firing and alleged that the men outside were exaggerating the incident. Following that, I decided to cover as many polling booths on the list as I could before the 6pm deadline where EVM malfunctioning had been reported. I started with the stations in Kairana and then proceeded to the booths in Shamli constituency. Every booth that was marked in the list witnessed disruption between 40 minutes and 4 hours, even if there could be slight variations as this information was anecdotal in nature. However, I tried confirming and cross-checking this at every booth from multiple people, including the police officials on duty. Only a couple of booths in the two dozen I managed to cover had a disruption of less than 30 minutes, which should ideally be the delay in such circumstances. I was told the replacement units in some had to be fetched from far-off locations than in the polling booths itself. Back in Kairana by around 6.45pm, I was helping myself to some kebabs at Chariyan Chowk (where, for some reason, the rate of a seekh Kebabs remain Rs 10 a piece since 2013, unaffected by all the inflation) when I got information that BJP candidate Mriganka Singh was back at the BJP office. I rushed to the place to find her surrounded by channel representatives, but got to speak to her exclusively once they were done. Here’s the transcript of the brief interview: Mriganka Singh (MS): Well, these are all false allegations and far beyond the truth because I know for myself that hundreds of out supporters have gone back from the polling station after waiting for three hours in the scorching sun and they were unable to cast their vote. MS: Well, I was around in villages where there was no network. So, I met the voters and only then I got to know. I could barely manage to make a call to my leaders and to the administration because in those villages there is no network most of the time.                                                              *** Though I heard news of elections in Nakur and Gangoh constituencies (part of the Saharanpur district) being extended beyond 6pm, I decided against going to those parts as it had already become dark. Before I made my way back, I got in touch with a prominent Opposition leader, who agreed to reply to my questions on WhatsApp. He asked how EVMs could malfunction in the heat at 7am when the temperature is less than 30 degrees. Back in Delhi, I also learned that the Election Commission had put out information that 15 to 20 EVMs had been replaced along with 384 VVPAT machines. That would mean more than 25 per cent of the total VVPAT machines in use since there are 1,483 polling booths in the Kairana parliamentary constituency. That means EC used up all its replacement machines and a few more (the EC usually keeps 25 per cent replacement machines ready, according to former chief election commissioner SY Quraishi). At the time of writing this piece, EC’s announcement of  in 73 booths in Kairana on May 30 was reported. What’s curious is that the repolling will be held mostly in Gangoh and Nakur segments — 44 booths in Gangoh, 23 in Nakur, five in Shamli and one booth in Thana Bhavan constituency is listed. Is it just a coincidence that the demography of these locations appears to favour one party more than the others?",2018-05-29,"Mriganka singh,BJP,Election Commission,Kairana by-poll",How the heat over EVM malfunctioning kept rising in Kairana,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/evm-mulfunctioning-kairana-bypoll-election-commission-bjp-mriganka-singh-tabassum-hasan-rld-sp-bsp-congress/story/1/24521.html
362,Makarand R Paranjape,"Tucked away in a corner in several leading newspapers on Monday, May 28, a small news item announced the resignation of Baijayant ""Jay"" Panda from the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). The 54-year-old was twice elected to the Lok Sabha from Kendrapara. In fact, his predecessor, Archana Nayak, quit the BJD to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2009. Now that Jaybhai has also quit the BJD, it seems as if Kendrapara, once considered a safe seat for BJD, is proving unlucky to the party. Before winning from Kendrapara, Panda served in the Rajya Sabha from 2000-09 as a representative of the BJD. With an impressive 18-year association, he is certainly one of our best known and impressive parliamentarians. Indeed, over the years, especially when he was frequently on national TV as the national spokesman of his party, he came to be known and admired all over the country. I have heard him speaking at important forums on a variety of topic, always finding him not only well-informed and stimulating but also inspiring and charismatic. Not only as one of our ablest and well-spoken MPs, but also a career politician with a clean image and new ideas, he is indeed brilliant. No wonder he would be a great asset to any political party. One of the founding members of the BJD when the party was formed nearly 20 years back, he has been one of Naveen Patnaik’s closest allies and supporters. But earlier this year, on January 24, Patnaik suspended him from the BJD for “anti-party activities”. Panda responded on Twitter: “I’m shocked at this news. Very very sad @Naveen_Odisha didn’t see thru the conspiracy against me led by an IAS officer now controlling the party. I vehemently deny the allegations against me, they are entirely false and baseless. I will pray to Jagannath for guidance before I respond further.” After waiting for four months, Jay submitted his three-page resignation on Monday: “It was with deep anguish, hurt and sorrow that I have decided to quit the kind of politics into which our BJD has descended.” Panda, who suffered a personal bereavement in losing his father, Bansidhar Panda, last week, continues, “Although things have been going from bad to worse for the past four years, it has plumbed the absolute depths of inhumanity when neither you nor anyone from the BJD turned up to pay their last respects to my father Dr Bansidhar Panda, who as everyone knows was a very close friend, supporter and associate of Biju uncle for many decades.” Panda’s equation with Patnaik changed after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014. The BJD, once an ally of BJP, broke the alliance ostensibly because of Patnaik’s dislike for Modi. Panda, on the other hand, has been an open admirer of the prime minister, praising the latter’s dynamic policies and leadership. Though Panda is popular in his constituency and respected all over the state, few in the BJD have dared to back him. On the other hand, it seems as if the BJP is willing to receive him with open arms. Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan is reported to have said, “All good people who accept the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah are welcome into the BJP.” The question is whether Panda can challenge Patnaik to emerge as the chief ministerial candidate in 2019. Though such speculation may be somewhat premature, Jay Panda could well be the game-changer that the BJP needs in the eastern state. The BJP has already emerged as the second-largest party in the state. In preparation for the 2019 state elections, several leaders from both the Congress and the BJD have defected to the BJP. There is no doubt that Modi and Shah would want to take their winning formula to this state as well. In this campaign, the articulate, educated and capable Jaybhai, with his huge personal wealth, may well pose a serious challenge to Patnaik. Perhaps this was the reason behind the smear campaign against Panda by BJD cadres and other detractors. Panda, with his considerable fortune derived from mining, power, real estate, hospitality and media, was accused of being a loan defaulter during the 2015 monsoon session of Parliament. Two of his companies, Indian Charge Crome Ltd (ICCL) and Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys (IMFA), were especially targeted. Panda has denied the charges. Panda was also accused of not campaigning for and supporting BJD candidates. A media critic has called him an “erudite, rich and connected, but a rootless politician”. But Patnaik, though still popular, is not invincible. The BJD, we must remember, has been in power for two decades. A certain degree of voter fatigue, not to speak of anti-incumbency, is bound to seep in after such a long inning. If Panda joins the BJP, if he secures the support of its bosses as also of the local rank and file, if he rises to the occasion to become an all Odisha leader, he certainly has every chance of being the state’s next chief minister. True, there are many “ifs”, if not “buts”, in the above projection, but personally, I believe that it will be the best thing for Odisha politics as also for the people of the state.

363,Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd,"Kautilya lived in India and wrote his treatise   in the third century BC. Niccolò Machiavelli lived in 16th century AD in Italy and wrote his book  .   though an economic title, is actually about statecraft, with a preamble to preserve Varnadharma (the fourfold caste order, with the Brahmin at the top and the Shudra at the bottom). It was written to preserve Hindu Dharma in ancient India, but its influence has remained on the subcontinent’s statecraft, except during the Muslim and colonial rule. However, it gained more prominence after Independence. It has been a book of study for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's (RSS') political and religious strategists ever since the organisation's inception in 1925. Its strategy of maintaining statecraft is threefold — political, religious and cultural. It propounds the political art of controlling state power through Hindu spiritual politics. , on the other hand, was written by Machiavelli to separate politics from religion. It was meant to liberate the European kings from the clutches of the spiritual control of the papacy. It is the initiator of the theory of the secular state: it separates the state's day-to-day functions from religious control. But both   and   advocate the ""end justifies means"" theory and combining the methods of ""Lion and Fox"" for achieving the ultimate goal. In independent India, Mohan Bhagwat is the most successful Kautilyan — and Indira Gandhi has been the most successful Machiavellian in both the Congress party and governance. The real ruler (whatever his caste; in ancient times, it was mostly the Kshatriyas, and today, it is Narendra Modi, a Bania OBC) does not handle full power, it is the Brahmin guru (Kautilya himself was a Brahmin guru) who calls the shots from behind. In contrast, in  , there is no guru to the king. In fact, the Pope was that guru for every king and Machiavelli aimed to finish that invisible guru’s hand in power play. The tactic succeeded in Europe and hence, secular states came into being. The RSS ideologically worked out a strategy that it should develop a system that continues the crucial role of the politically manipulative spiritual guru even in the democratic setup by negating the theory of separation of state and religion by systemically using the Kautilyan model with the Sarsanghchalak position. Within the RSS, the latter plays the role of Kautilya today while the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Sangh's political wing, rules the state. After the 2014 general election, though Narendra Modi (a Bania OBC) became the visible ruler — he is also a demagogic orator and vote puller for the unorganised masses — real decision making power has remained in the hands of Mohan Bhagwat (a Chitpawan Brahmin most eligible for that position, according to Hindu Dharma). During the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime, this Kautilyan role of the then Sarsanghchalak was not necessary as the prime minister was self-sufficient, though he was not a vote puller. Secondly, in the coalitional system, the guru’s role of invisible hand was not very critical. Hence, in the Vajpayee period — one dominated by alliances — Kautilya was dormant, and very much in the background. Now that there is full majority for the BJP, the guru is playing the role of re-uniting state and religion in India, which had been separated during the British rule — and largely remained so till 2014. This union will pose massive implications for the survival of democracy and the secular state in India. The Karnataka drama was played out by Mohan Bhagwat by invoking the Kautilyan principle of ""end justifies the means"". Operationalising this principle in the state was the goal of the RSS, the invisible hand. BJP's CM candidate here was BS Yeddyurappa, known as a corrupt Shudra and if he were to become the chief minister, he would have worked according to the direction of the guru. Crimes like lynching over beef eating, and attacking secular and liberal intellectuals are part of the Kautilyan statecraft. Kautilya was very clear, like Machiavelli, that once you assess the enemy, you must eliminate him/her by all means. Rationalist MM Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh were murdered in exactly this fashion. Many well-known intellectuals from Karnataka continue to live with police protection. The Congress' Machiavellianism began with Indira Gandhi dismissing the Left front government of Kerala in 1959, starting with her initiative as the party president, much against the views of her father and former prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru, by all means, was secular, but not Machiavellian. But during her time, Indira Gandhi continued the practice of ""end justifies means"" and was a victim of the practice. Though she was secular in her designs, without a guru or invisible hand throughout her political career, she achieved her ends. Emergency was its final product. Like the Machiavellian prince, she did everything on her own, without any underhand figure directing her. Since it was one-person regime, the state found a way out. What is more, when the invisible guru does everything and the real ruler pretends to not know (as Narendra Modi does) what is going on, the danger to the secular state and society is deeper. The Congress never had such a structure. The PM in the Congress rule is the prince himself! Manmohan Singh was the only exception to that rule — he was the PM, but without influence. He was a ruling economist. During his 10-year stint, no state government was dismissed unceremoniously; no genuine majority party or coalition was stopped from governing the state. Of course, that was because Sonia Gandhi — as Congress president — was no Indira Gandhi. Though she was born Italian, she has never been Machiavellian in her approach. Machiavelli’s prince was progressive for his times. To reiterate, separating the state from the religion was his ultimate objective. It did good to the world's welfare democratic system. The Kautilyan gurudom is its anti-thesis. Its end is to dismantle the democratic secular state and take India exactly on the lines of Pakistan, where the modern Mullahs rule. The Hindu guru and the Islamic Mullah have no differences when it comes to theocratising the state. If the RSS rule continues, the democratic morals of India's citizens will collapse. The guru’s handbook is not Ambedkar’s Constitution, but  The RSS opposes not only Machiavelli the Italian but also Rousseau, the French thinker. In their Kautilyan scheme, they are also opposed to democracy as an un-Indian system. If they come to power in 2019, they will move stridently towards their foremost objective — the abolition of India's election system.",2018-05-28,"Machiavelli,Congress,Indira Gandhi,Arthashastra","RSS the Kautilya, unlike Congress, will abolish India's election system",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rss-congress-kautilya-arthashastra-machiavelli-economics/story/1/24480.html
364,Amit Sengupta,"In the scorching sugar bowl of dusty western Uttar Pradesh, where the smell of jaggery and sugar cane juice pervades the air, the political temperatures are rising. The people of laid-back  are in the process of deciding which party they want to govern them. However, there is no doubt that the three faces of Hindutva must have been a worried lot on Sunday night (May 27). For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah, and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, alias Ajay Kumar Bisht, things may not be favourable this time. Modi inaugurated a 9km expressway on Sunday, only to land in Baghpat. For a master electoral demagogue, who has hitherto stayed away from by-polls, this was a meaningful departure and a significant signal. He wanted to influence things in Kairana. But this columnist found out during reporting in western UP that things are not going Modi's way in Kairana. However, journalists can't make prophecies given the complex nature of the Indian electorate. What is, however, clear is that Kairana is not listening to the BJP. The prevailing sentiment reeks of angst, acrimony and anger. Predictably, Yogi operated like a commissar. He gave a rousing communal speech in a bid to polarise voters. While he raked up the Muzzaffarnagar riots yet again talking about the persecution of the Hindu community, he did not once mention the gang-rapes of Muslim women or the issue of 60,000 displaced Muslims in the wake of the 2014 Muzaffarnagar riots. Meanwhile, why the Election Commission refuses to take note of such brazen transgressions of the model code of conduct remains unanswered. The pre-Lok Sabha election riots were socially engineered. The BJP never really had a base in western UP. The riots polarised the entire Hindu community with divisive mahapanchayats being held by upper castes, Dalits and Jats. Yogi is desperate to win Kairana after the humiliating defeat in Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-polls. The death of BJP's sitting MP, Hukum Singh, resulted in the Kairana by-polls. His daughter, Mriganka, is in the fray pitted against Tabassum Hasan. Hasan is the united Opposition candidate led by Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal, and backed by Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party and Congress. She is from BSP, and has been strategically fielded as a RLD candidate. The attempt at communal polarisation doesn't seem to be working for the BJP in Kairana despite Yogi fanning the issue of Mohammad Ali Jinnah's portrait in Aligarh Muslim University. The truth is that it is not Jinnah but ganna (sugar cane) which is the issue dominating western UP these days. A   on May 26 while protesting against the power tariff hike and non-payment of dues by the sugar mills. Farmers waiting for days outside sugar mills with tractors loaded with sugar cane is a common sight in this area. Most big farmers are Jats and are backing the RLD. Like many of his ""jumlas"", Modi promised the farmers the world, including loan waiver, and 50 per cent on the common remunerative prices. He betrayed them on all fronts. The agricultural crisis in rural India has to be seen to be believed. The media cares two hoots, but it is real. And that is why farmers here are asking if the Opposition can come together in Banglore, why not for the suffering farmers of western UP? Kairana has around 1.6 million voters. As many as 960,000 (60 per cent) might end up backing the united Opposition alliance. There are 5,40,000 Muslims (33 per cent), 2,80,000 Dalits (18 per cent) and 1,40,000 Jats (9 per cent), along with other backward castes, backing the RLD candidate. The BJP is stuck with the Thakurs, with Yogi as its poster boy, Brahmins, Baniyas (the old Jan Sangh constituency), and sundry other upper castes. Significantly, the Dalits have totally turned around, unlike post Muzzafarnagar riots. Even though the BSP campaign is low-key, Mayawati's photos that show her hugging Sonia Gandhi in Bangalore have given people hope as an electoral signal of the party's relevance. With Muslims as ally, and Jats marking a dynamic shift, BJP party is likely to be spoilt. Add to this the call for Bhim Army leader Chandrashekhar Azad's release from jail in Saharanpur. At Harijan Basti, Azad's mother, told this writer that he was not even allowed to eat the ""kheer"" she cooked for him after his 10-day fast in jail on BR Ambedkar's birth anniversary on April 14. On another occasion, she was not allowed to carry the roti-sabzi she cooked for Azad. ""Even freedom fighters during British time did not suffer such persecution,"" said his brother Kamal Kishore. Bhim Army's media coordinator, Sachin Walia (24), was murdered in May in Ramnagar near Saharanpur. He is the brother of the district chief of Bhim Army, Kamal Walia. Hundreds of Dalit youths gathered for his funeral. Many of these young men participated in the Bharat Bandh protests against the dilution of SC/ST Atrocities Act. A lot of them were detained for the protests. There is considerable anger among them. There is a political shift in the electoral line of the ""apolitical"" Bhim Army which runs 350 schools for all communities providing free of cost education and focusing on social work. Azad had earlier asked Dalits follow their individual conscience while voting, however, he has now urged the Dalits to defeat the BJP. And this could well be the turning point.",2018-05-28,"Dalit votes,Muzaffarnagar riots,Yogi Adityanath,Kairana by-poll",Why Kairana is not listening to BJP this time around,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/dalit-votes-kairana-by-polls-bhim-army-yogi-adityanath-muzaffarnagar-riots/story/1/24476.html
365,Seemi Pasha,"Opposition parties, including regional satraps, coming together to form a against the BJP ahead of the crucial 2019 Lok Sabha polls isn't the only worry for the ruling party at the Centre. Prime Minister Modi and his lieutenant Amit Shah's immediate concerns would be BJP's numbers in the current Lok Sabha which have come down significantly since 2014 because of multiple by-poll losses. A look at the 23 Lok Sabha seats, where by-polls have taken place since 2014, shows that the BJP has won only four. When the BJP stormed to power in 2014 led by Narendra Modi, the NDA won a massive mandate bagging 336 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha. The BJP emerged as the single-largest party crossing the halfway mark with a spectacular 282. But since then, the saffron party's numbers have decreased owing to successive defeats in by-polls. In the last by-polls where elections were held for the Phulpur and Gorakhpur seats in Uttar Pradesh and Araria in Bihar, the saffron party was dealt a heavy blow. The loss of the Gorakhpur seat came as a personal embarrassment for Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath who had scored five straight wins from the seat since 1998. He had vacated the seat after being appointed as chief minister. Phulpur had been won by BJP strongman Keshva Prasad Maurya, who had also vacated the seat after being appointed deputy CM. In neighbouring Bihar, Lalu Prasad's Rashtriya Janata Dal managed to retain Araria despite a strong fight from the BJP. Earlier in February this year, by-polls in Ajmer and Alwar in Rajashthan and Uluberia in West Bengal had also come as a major boost to the Opposition. The Congress defeated the BJP in Alwar and Ajmer and increased its tally from 46 to 48 in the Lok Sabha. Congress' Raghu Sharma defeated BJP's Ram Swaroop Lamba by 84,414 votes and won the Ajmer Lok Sabha seat. In Alwar, Congress' Karan Singh Yadav won the seat by 1.97 lakh votes. In Uluberia, Trinamool Congress' Sajda Ahmed defeated the BJP candidate by almost five lakh votes and helped the party retain the seat. Last year in the by-election held for Gurdaspur seat in Punjab, the Congress party reaffirmed its dominance in the state with its candidate, Sunil Jhakar, defeating BJP's candidate by 1.93 lakh votes. The seat had earlier been held by the BJP but had fallen vacant after the death of actor-turned-politician, Vinod Khanna. By-polls were held in April last year for the Srinagar, Malappuram and Amritsar Lok Sabha seats. National Conference chief Rafooq Abdullah won the Srinagar seat, defeating PDP's Nazir Khan by a margin of 10,700 votes. The Indian Union Muslim League retained the Malappuram constituency, winning by a margin of over 1.7 lakh votes. In Amritsar, Congress' Gurjit Singh Ahluwalia won the seat by a margin of almost two lakh votes. By-polls for Coochbehar and Tamluk Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal and Tura in Meghalaya were held in 2016. The TMC managed to win both the seats that were up for grabs in West Bengal and National People's Party candidate Conrad Sangma won the Tura seat that had earlier been held by his father. The BJP faced a humiliating defeat in the Ratlam by-election which was a high stakes battle. Congress' Kantilal Bhuria defeated the BJP with a margin of 88,000 votes. The saffron party had won the seat for the first time in 2014 but failed to hold on to it. By-poll for the Warangal Lok Sabha seat was won by the Telangana Rashtriya Samiti and for Bangoan was won by the TMC. Just months after the BJP stormed to power in May 2014 riding on the Modi magic, by-polls took place in Medak in Telangana, Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh and Kandhamal in Odisha where the BJP was defeated. The TRS bagged the Medak seat, Samajwadi Party's Tej Pratap Singh won the Mainpuri seat and the Biju Janata Dal picked up the Kandhamal seat. The only by-polls that the BJP has won since 2014 are Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh in 2016, Vadodara in Gujarat in 2014 after Modi vacated the seat, Lakhimpur in Assam in 2016, and Beed in Maharashtra in 2014. BS Yeddyurappa and Sriramulu's resignation from the Lok Sabha after the Karnataka polls along with multiple by-poll losses have reduced BJP's numbers from 282 to just 272 in the lower house. The May 28 by-poll to four Lok Sabha seats will be extremely crucial for the BJP if it wants to retain its psychological edge in terms of numbers. However, even without these numbers, the NDA continues to enjoy a comfortable majority in the House with its allies.",2018-05-28,"Bjp in lok sabha,Narendra Modi,Kairana by-poll,2019 general election",What May 28 by-polls mean for BJP's falling numbers in Lok Sabha,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/2019-general-election-kairana-by-poll-bjp-tally-in-lok-sabha-palghar-by-poll-narendra-modi/story/1/24475.html
366,Seema Guha,"Is the   bromance over? Is this the end of the road for the world’s two most unpredictable leaders? Will this escalate tension in the Korean Peninsula and lead to a US military strike on North Korea? What would be China’s reaction? What would China, Russia and Japan do? The White House has been hinting at China’s role in the hardening of Pyongyang’s position. More fissures in the region will open up and lead to further instability in Asia. The worst-affected would be South Korea and its President Moon Jae-in. Though nothing of this sort has happened yet, if the situation is not salvaged quickly the possibility of war cannot be ruled out. But that will not happen immediately. For developing countries like India, already hit by rising oil prices following the US walking out of the Iran nuclear deal, tension in the Korean Peninsula will makes matters worse. Of course, the situation could well be salvaged. This could also be just pressure and posturing on both sides and the talks may eventually happen at a later date, when both sides have a better understanding of each other's position. North Korea’s reaction to Trump has been sober. That is an indication that Kim is playing hardball and would not like to let go of this opportunity to be a major player in the world stage. North Korea had already begun the process of dismantling its nuclear test site ahead of the summit. It had said it would dismantle the Punggye-ri facility completely. That process would now be halted unless there is some clarity on the talks. The scrapping of the June 12 meeting in Singapore was not unexpected, considering the angry rhetoric flowing from both sides last week. The summit was called off by Trump, though he left the door open for the future, asking Kim to call or write to him if the latter changed his mind. Many hard-nosed diplomats are not surprised, considering such meetings take months and months of  preparations. But with Trump, who had turned the rules of international diplomacy on its head, the swiftness with which the meeting was arranged, without adequate preparations, was just the way the new administration works. Such meetings take months of backroom discussions, claim seasoned diplomats. But with the new business approach, Trump rushed through the arrangements thinking he had a good business deal to cut with North Korea. He also had an eye on winning the Nobel Peace Prize, for which his supporters were drumming up support even before the two leaders met. Many are sniggering at Trump’s amateur antics at peace-making. So what happens now? The hopes of peace in the Korean Peninsula, which for a few weeks following  Kim Jong-un’s visit to the South seemed bright, has now receded. For the divided families in Korea, this would be a terrible let-down. Their hopes had risen following the meeting between Kim and Moon Jae-in. He was surprised at the turn of events. Moon is the man who went out of his way to arrange the summit. The political fallout for him would be a heavy blow. He had come to power with the promise of breaking the deadlock with the North. He naturally urged Kim and Trump not to abandon their ambitious plans and said they should talk directly to each other. ""Denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace are historic tasks that can neither be abandoned nor delayed,"" Moon was quoted as saying by the South Korean press. Much of the blame for the no-show is with the US. It all began with America’s new hardliner national security adviser John Bolton, suggesting that North Korea should follow the ""Libyan model"" of nuclear disarmament. If Bolton had any sense, he would have known that North Korea always believed that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi  had made a major mistake by believing the West. For Pyongyang, keeping its nuclear programme going was the one insurance against regime change and American invasion of their country. The minute Libya was mentioned, North Korea was unnerved. Pyongyang dubbed the remarks as ""sinister"". Bolton’s remarks were repeated by vice-president Mike Pence. This time the response from Pyongyang was hard-hitting. Choe Son Hui, vice-foreign minister, said that North Korea could ""make the US taste an appalling tragedy it has neither experienced nor even imagined"". Another North Korean official called Pence both ""ignorant and stupid"". Luckily better sense may yet prevail. For Trump beset with troubles at home, a peace deal with North Korea would be just what the doctor prescribed. It would be a legacy moment for Trump if he can still pull off a deal with Kim. Perhaps both sides are already working behind the scenes to get things moving. One can only wait and watch the situation unfold.",2018-05-26,"Nuclear disarmament,Kim Jong-un,Donald Trump,Us-north korea",Summit cancelled but Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un may still spring a surprise,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/us-north-korea-trump-kim-bromance-nuclear-disarmament-trump-nobel-peace-prize-singapore-summit/story/1/24445.html
367,Anirudh Deshpande,"In May 1857, the Sepoy rebels in Meerut wiped out the British garrison and stormed into Delhi, taking the somnolent city by surprise. After killing some Indian Christians and Europeans, they soon declared the unwilling old poet emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar their leader. He was left with no choice but to assume the leadership of a Hindustan in revolt against the Company Bahadur. The Meerut mutineers could have advanced on Lucknow or Kanpur, but they chose Delhi for a reason not necessarily connected to the geographical distance between Meerut and Shahjahanabad. The aim of the insurgents was to overthrow the Company and restore the Mughal Empire. But why did they repose faith in an emperor who was himself an English pensioner? There is something deeper in that symbolism of the times. Something related to the popular appeal of the Mughal Empire and its abiding political legitimacy in the India. This socio-political legitimacy went back to Akbar’s reign which was marked by a respect for India’s cultural plurality difficult to find in our contemporary times. This respect for the other ensured the real and symbolic longevity of the Empire established in India by the scholar-soldier Zahiruddin Babar. All the successor states of the Mughals in the 18th century and even the Marathas derived political legitimacy from the capitals of the Mughal Empire. The English East India Company also received a farman from the debauch emperor Faruksiyar at a time when the Mughal Empire was disintegrating rapidly. In 1765, Clive laid down the foundations of British Rule in India by signing the Treaty of Allahabad with the Mughal emperor and acquiring the Diwani of Bengal. For a long time, the officers of the Company saw themselves as the legitimate heirs of the Mughal State. Indeed, the Mughal Empire is a near perfect case study of imperial longevity. There is much in it of relevance to the future of India. The longevity of the Mughal Empire was underpinned by the policy of Sulah Kul, meaning the peaceful coexistence of communities in a diverse civilisational matrix. To understand this, we must distinguish historical elite political conflict from a civilisational confrontation. It seems a few setbacks were suffered by Sulah Kul during the reign of Aurangzeb, but in general Sulah Kul prevailed despite the endemic political conflict of a diverse medieval polity. In fact, the late Professor Athar Ali, historian from the AMU, conclusively proved that there were more Hindu nobles in the court of Alamgir than his ancestors on the basis of meticulous research. His work on Mughal nobility is still considered a classic. Hindu nobles in the Mughal court in the latter half of the 17th century exceeded the numbers achieved under Akbar because all the Mughal emperors, from Akbar onwards, followed a policy of coopting Hindu nobles in ever increasing numbers to keep them away from possible dissent and thereby stabilised the empire. As the Empire matured and aged, its Hindu component increased. In general, the Mughal emperors maintained a balance between various ethnic groups of aristocrats in their courts; Mughal, Irani, Turani, Pathan, Rajputs and Indian Muslims. Had Aurangzeb been anti-Hindu, as is usually believed thanks to colonial and communal historiography, this would not have been the case. The number of Hindu nobles would have been reduced drastically and Shivaji would not have travelled to Agra to seek a high mansab from the emperor after the Treaty of Purandar (1665). Scholars assert that despite the strains suffered by the Mughal polity in the latter half of the 17th century, Sulah Kul survived. The Mughals ruled a vast area by maintaining a balance of communities in India. Even the Deccan Sultanates followed the same policy. This balance of communities was substituted by politicised religious difference during British rule. This essential difference between Mughal and colonial India was appreciated by secular nationalists like Gandhi and Nehru. This appreciation of India’s pluralistic past guided their vision of an inclusive tolerant postcolonial India. This vision, which lies in tatters now, must be resurrected to keep the idea of India alive and healthy because more than a nation India is a diverse civilisation. In the 20th century, Nehru was not wrong in adopting Sulah Kul as part of his program of building a secular and democratic republic in India. His policy of peaceful coexistence, also one of the pillars of Non Alignment, was based on a correct interpretation of Indian history. The republic created in 1950 will fail if peaceful coexistence of communities is not practised as conscious state policy. Endemic blood shed and communal fratricide will be the result of this failure in the modern context. Sulah Kul is a matter of grave concern and serious introspection. It was destroyed by British Colonialism and by the Historicisation of the Indian mind by colonial ideology. The secular Indian nationalists tried to overcome this ideological impact of colonialism on the Indian minds but remained partially successful, their attempts thwarted by communalism. After Nehru, the Congress gradually became complicit in the promotion of Hindu communalism in the 1960s and 1970s. Matters worsened when the Indian polity shifted rightwards during globalisation. There is no country in the world where the Centre has held firm under the assault of globalisation. In India, the political rise of Hindutva is coterminous with globalisation ushered in by the Congress. The defeat of Hindutva and other communalisms is a sina qua non of a return to a modernised Sulah Kul. Given the historical record of the Congress vis a vis secularism since the 1920s, can it be entrusted to rescue India from the tyranny of Hindutva? Will a party which ceded space to Hindu communalism, and proved its Muslim detractors right, be able to save India from the demons spawned by perverted communal hallucinations? It is obvious that the present cannot be understood without reference to the past. And it is true that the past always has a past. In India this means the difference between precolonial and colonial contexts. The votaries of the Congress are happy with the recent political outcomes in Karnataka. They look up to Rahul Gandhi to lead the country out of its current morass. Rahul Gandhi is s decent compassionate man. But is Rahul Gandhi capable of revisiting the history of Sulah Kul in India, like his illustrious great grandfather? The point is not to retreat into history but draw the right lessons from its material realities and political symbolism. There is no better month in India than May to do so because of several reasons. For now we still have the Constitution, the Red Fort and their histories and legacies. The Mutineers of 1857 reposed faith in the wrong man because they were restorationists. This is easy to understand and possibly repeat. But do we have the luxury of indulging in false consciousness? Unless the rebels of today trust the right man, this country’s slide into dehumanisation will be impossible to arrest.",2018-05-25,"Communal politics,Hindutva,Mughals,Jawaharlal Nehru",Why India must embrace the Mughal legacy that worked for Akbar and Nehru,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/akbar-nehru-did-for-india-hindutva-threat-sulah-kul-mughal-empire-delhi/story/1/24438.html
368,Harsh V Pant,"This month marks two decades since India crossed the nuclear rubicon in 1998 and declared itself as a de facto  . It has been a long journey since then and the US-India civil nuclear deal was the culmination, making India part of the global nuclear architecture and its integration into the global nuclear order. But as New Delhi works towards entering the Nuclear Suppliers Group and recalibrates its deterrence vis-à- vis China and Pakistan, debates continue about the future of India as a nuclear power. A crude nuclear stability has emerged in South Asia as India’s calibrated responses to the three major region crises since May 1998 demonstrate. Nuclear weapons have contributed to regional strategic stability by reducing the risk of full-scale war in the region. Despite repeated provocations by Pakistan — in 1999, 2001-02 and 2008 — and a resentful Indian public that wanted its government to retaliate, the Indian policymakers demonstrated an extraordinary measure of restraint in the aftermath of all three crises, refusing to launch even small-scale limited attacks against Pakistan. The Indian government forbade the military to cross the Line of Control despite the Indian military officials clearly wanting to pursue such a posture. In 2016, the Modi government changed that when the Indian Army’s special forces took out several suspected terror camps across the volatile Line of Control in Kashmir in response to an attack on an Indian Army post in Kashmir by Pakistan-based terrorists that killed 20 soldiers. The Indian  came almost 11 days after the initial attack and reflected an attempt by the Modi government to pressurise Pakistan on multiple fronts, thereby gaining leverage over an adversary that had long used terrorism and proxies to challenge India. The Modi government decided to use the instrumentality of military power — a tool which New Delhi had avoided for long. What was new was not that cross-border raids took place, but that India decided to publicise them to the extent it did. Pakistan’s reaction was contradictory. While the nation’s military issued a flat denial of Indian claims and insisted that only cross-LoC firing had taken place, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif decried India’s “naked aggression”, and suggested that the move had exacerbated the civil-military divide in the country. With its move, India did not discard strategic restraint, contrary to what many have suggested, but managed to reset the terms of military engagement with Pakistan. For years now, Pakistan had raised the bogey of nuclear weapons to put India in a state of strategic limbo. After the Uri attacks, Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif had waved the nuclear sabre and threatened to “annihilate” India if attacked. But with its strikes, India has managed to convey to Pakistan and to other external stakeholders that Pakistan’s nuclear blackmail has no legs to stand on and that India has military room to operate below the threshold that would trigger major conventional, or even nuclear, escalation. India is also trying to shape a counter narrative about the ability of India to inflict pain on Pakistan. By constantly deciding not to react militarily to Pakistani provocations, New Delhi was losing its deterrence credibility, further fuelling Pakistan’s adventurism. Indian policymakers cutting across the ideological spectrum have been trying to grapple with Pakistan’s adventurous foreign policy for years now. In fact, former National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon’s book talks of Pakistan’s nuclear shield permitting it to undertake terrorist attacks on India without fear of retaliation, a key variable that is resulting in new ways of looking at India’s posture. Though the BJP-led government has so far not proposed any change in the doctrine or the ""no first use"" on which India’s declaratory nuclear doctrine is based, it had promised in its 2014 election manifesto to “study in detail India’s nuclear doctrine, and revise and update it, to make it relevant to challenges of current times”. Manohar Parrikar, India’s defence minister till early 2017, questioned India’s NFU policy on nuclear weapons, asking, “Why a lot of people say that India has no first use policy… I should say I am a responsible nuclear power and I will not use it irresponsibly… And as an individual, I get a feeling sometime why do I say that I am not going to use it first. I am not saying that you have to use it first just because you don’t decide that you don’t use it first. The hoax can be called off.” But what really set the cat among the pigeons is a passage in a recent book by India’s former national security advisor, Shiv Shankar Menon, wherein he writes: “There is a potential grey area as to when India would use nuclear weapons first against another NWS (nuclear weapons state). Circumstances are conceivable in which India might find it useful to strike first, for instance, against an NWS that had declared it would certainly use its weapons, and if India were certain that adversary’s launch was imminent.” This has led some to argue that there is a major doctrinal shift happening in India whereby New Delhi may abandon its NFU nuclear policy and launch a preemptive strike against Pakistan if it feared that Islamabad was likely to use the weapons first. This is being viewed by many in the West as a seismic shift in India’s nuclear posture, one which may have significant consequences for South Asian strategic stability. But as we complete 20 years since Pokhran II, it is time to reassess Indian nuclear policy and posture. Indian nuclear doctrine was articulated in 1999 and it certainly needs to be reviewed. All doctrines require regular reappraisals and Indian nuclear doctrine will inevitably have to respond to contemporary challenges. New Delhi should not shy away from this debate.

369,Rajeev Sharma,"It was much more than a mere photo-op. Just consider the scenario. Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party chiefs Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav respectively sharing the stage at a swearing-in ceremony for the first time ever. Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi posing with Mayawati. Sonia and Mayawati hugging like sportspersons from the same team. Arch-enemies in the West Bengal political theatre, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury and chief minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee shaking hands! Notably, four chief ministers attended JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy’s oath-taking ceremony: Andhra Pradesh’s Chandrababu Naidu, Kerala's P Vijayan, Delhi's Arvind Kejriwal, apart from Mamata Banerjee — all four leaders from different parties. Virtually, the entire Opposition was in attendance. The notable exception was regional satrap and chief minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik (chief of Biju Janata Dal), indicating that the Opposition still has some work to do. Though another chief minister and regional satrap K Chandrasekhar Rao (chief of Telangana Rashtriya Samiti) was conspicuous by his absence at the swearing-in, it must be pointed out that KCR visited Kumaraswamy in Bangalore only yesterday to express solidarity with him, apprising him about the pre-arranged engagement he couldn't cancel and telling him that he would be sending his son for the oath-taking, which he did. This stupendous gathering of Opposition, a rarity in Indian politics ever since the Modi-era, is well-orchestrated optics for Mission 2019. It's the first hurrah of a fast unifying Opposition. It has taken them four years. It is worth mentioning that this show of Opposition unity did not happen in February 2015, when Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) made mincemeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) months after the Modi tsunami, winning 67 seats in the 70-member Assembly, leaving the rest for the BJP and the Congress with a zero. Nor did the Opposition put up such a grand unity show at the next red letter day ten months later, when the grand alliance of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Janata Dal (United) and the Congress trounced the BJP in the October 2015 Bihar Assembly polls. Two back-to-back political reversals for the Modi-led BJP suggested a seemingly early demise for the BJP. However, nothing of the sort happened and since then, the same old story has repeated itself across the country: BJP winning and the Opposition losing all Assembly polls. For the first time since the Bihar polls, the Opposition got something worth cheer in this month's Karnataka Assembly elections that threw up a fractured mandate. And look at the quirk of fate. The BJP met its Waterloo even after emerging as the single largest party with 104 seats, just seven short of a clear majority as against 78 of the Congress and 37 of the JD(S). It happens only in politics that a party finishing last in a three-horse race becomes the eventual winner. But the BJP's embarrassment stems from the fact that it failed to gain power in Karnataka even after winning 104 seats, though it managed to form governments in Goa, Manipur and Meghalaya where the Congress was the single largest party — Meghalaya being the most ludicrous example of political impossibilities where BJP won just two seats in the 60-member house. Karnataka may well prove to be a turning point, politically speaking. No, it's not just because of the fact that the BJP’s juggernaut was finally stopped in Karnataka. Nor is it because the BJP had to eat the humble pie even after an indulgent governor swore in BJP's BS Yeddyurappa as chief minister — who decided to resign 55 hours later without even facing the trust vote. But the most important factor, which may make Karnataka a political watershed, is Kumaraswamy’s swearing-in — an event the entire Opposition used in order to showcase its unity. First, whether the Opposition bonhomie on display in Bengaluru today will continue till the next general elections. Second, even if considering the utopian scenario from the Opposition viewpoint that its unity will remain intact it remains to be seen whether it produces a contrary effect and makes the electorate to tilt towards Modi's BJP. The BJP is already working overtime in carpet bombing social media with this message: “The Mahabharata says when everyone gets united against one man then that man must be a true, capable abd hobest leader.” Third, whatever the final scenario, the very fact that the Opposition has finally succeeded in gathering on one common platform is no mean achievement. Post-Delhi, the AAP has steadily gone down the hill and even lost to the BJP in the Delhi municipal elections this year. Similarly, post-Bihar, the Opposition’s celebrations didn't last long and the state fell back into the BJP's lap as Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar parted ways. This is the third time when the Opposition is feeling jubilant and resurgent. Yet again, the Opposition-versus-BJP game is playing out and the Opposition parties must be wondering whether it's going to be third-time lucky for them. It will be quite an uphill task for the Congress-JD(S) coalition government to avoid a repeat of the Bihar experiment. The BJP may be down but definitely not out. Whatever may be the final outcome, the Bangalore event promises to throw open a bigger political game on a much wider canvass — one the Modi-led BJP would be ignoring at its own peril.",2018-05-23,"Opposition,BJP,Karnataka Assembly polls,Hd kumaraswamy",Full heat: Why entire Opposition showed up at Karnataka CM's swearing-in,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/hd-kumaraswamy-oath-bjp-amit-shah-modi-against-opposition-swearing-in-karnataka/story/1/24384.html
370,Amarnath K Menon,"Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao is hopeful of stealing the thunder by giving away a grant of Rs 4,000 an acre for a crop season to all those who have farmland in the state. The unique investment support, Rythu Bandhu Scheme (RBS), covering 10,047 villages in 30 districts, excluding urban Hyderabad, involved handing out personalised cheques and new pattadar passbooks with unique security features, including Aadhaar linkage. It aims to ensure that the actual owners get the money, unlike in the loan waiver, and other pro-farmer schemes where intermediaries make a killing. KCR has, after going through a loan waiver scheme earlier in his tenure, opted for the novel investment support scheme offering a grant to farmers so that they decide what they want to buy with it. This is after several weeks of planning and preparation to reach funds and passbooks, across the state. The original one-week schedule, which was extended, made it possible for 99 of every 100 beneficiaries to get the cash entitlement and the new pattadar passbooks by May 20. Of the 2.9 crore acre land in the state, about 2.38 crore acre have been verified and about 1.4 crore acre was verified as cultivable land during the 100-day land purification exercise last year. RBS covers all farm land owners but excludes tenant farmers. While some rich farmers have returned the cheques or suggested that their entitlement be transferred to the CM’s relief fund, the Telangana CM has announced fresh measures to alleviate their distress. He has tasked the farmers’ coordination committees at different levels to play a pro-active role in resolving the issues faced by farmers. KCR intends to mount pressure on the Union government to enhance the minimum support price (MSP) for agricultural produce by at least 25 per cent. When rolling out RBS — a balm for 57,33,000 farmers — at Chelpur in Huzurabad mandal, on May 10, KCR announced that farmers would also enjoy an insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh from June 2 — the Telangana State Formation Day. “Apart from these incentives, when we complete the irrigation projects, the state will cultivate three crops a year,” said KCR, exuding confidence about his initiatives redefining the future of agriculture in the country. The TRS intends to piggyback on this massive vote corpus — set to drain the state exchequer of Rs 12,000 crore a year — and enable KCR make his national pitch of providing an alternative to the BJP-steered NDA and the Congress-driven UPA. KCR wants a national coalition of strong regional parties to rule the country for balanced growth of all states which the national parties have failed to achieve. Political detractors are not impressed. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy described RBS as an election gimmick. ""The TRS government has become a curse on farmers. After he announced that he would waive Rs1 lakh of agricultural loans in one go, KCR divided it into four phases and the process is still incomplete. What is worse, some 4,000 farmers committed suicide but the state has not paid compensation to their families,"" said Reddy, promising the Congress will waive loans totalling to Rs 2 lakh each in one go for all farmers, on assuming office after the next elections. It is not guaranteed if all these positive strokes will help propel KCR into creating an enduring national coalition. But the initiatives will certainly make agriculture a part of the election discourse and get farmers lip sympathy.

371,Anand Kochukudy,"At the   of HD Kumaraswamy as the chief minister of Karnataka at the steps of the iconic Vidhan Soudha complex (that houses the Karnataka legislative assembly) on May 23, almost the entire spectrum of Opposition leaders in the country was in attendance. With Karnataka Assembly elections throwing up a verdict that succeeded in uniting the  , the general elections might become a very even contest. But what are the chances of the Opposition dislodging Narendra Modi? Modi remains BJP's primary vote grabber and is still going strong despite a dip in his popularity. Ever since Modi became the face of the BJP, it has been going strong at the hustings; retaining states that were already in its kitty and wresting states from Congress and others. The Opposition parties seem to have finally woken up to the reality that it's the divisions among them that have helped the BJP to win state after state. Additionally, many of these Opposition parties might have a secular concern with the majoritarian impulses of the Modi government and incremental attacks on the Constitution and subversion of institutions safeguarding our democracy. But will a joint Opposition be successful in defeating the BJP without a popular backlash against Narendra Modi? And how does this disparate bunch take on the might of Modi without a face? These are questions that have been sought to be papered over with the arithmetic calculation of coalition numbers. Granted, there is still some time to go before the general elections — unless Modi decides to prepone it to the winter — but there are still many unanswered questions. The general public was not swayed by Opposition unity against Indira Gandhi in 1971, when the Congress (Organisation) got together with all the Opposition parties then (from the Socialists to the Swatantra Party to the Lok Dal to Jan Sangh) to try and defeat her. But Indira Gandhi was defeated by the same group post the Emergency and its excesses. As for Rajiv Gandhi, he swept to power on the back of 404 seats in 1984 but lost five years later when the entire Opposition united on the plank of corruption. The million dollar question: What is the plank on which the Opposition parties unite against Narendra Modi's BJP for 2019? Is it going to be on the lines of ""protect the Constitution"" or ""save democracy"" etc? If so, it is simply not going to work even if the arithmetic were to favour the Opposition. The reason is that unlike Indira Gandhi and her subversion of institutions in the run-up to and during the period of Emergency, Narendra Modi has been very clever with the way he has gone about centralising power and chipping away at the pillars of democracy. The process is not overt and hardly impacts the public in a way that they wake up to the dangers of it. It is like boiling a frog alive as people will wake up to it only when the tentacles of the octopus begin to choke their throat at a much later stage. 
 
 The common man is more interested in how a government impacts his day-to-day life, inflation, wages, and living standards etc. Moreover, people like a positive agenda and like hearing good things about their country and its future. In 2014, anger against perceived corruption and inflation was so strong that the BJP tapped into it, but let's also not forget that the mandate was won on the plank of ""vikas"" and ""achhe din"". So, a negative campaign against Modi will not be enough even if the arithmetic favours the Opposition. Of course, Modi's failures can be enumerated and his non-fulfilment of promises can be audited — but would that be enough to turn the tide against the prime minister? There is another reason why a joint opposition on an anti-Modi plank may not work or come short. Many of these parties have not been successful in mobilising the anger among sections of people against the BJP government and channelising it to win elections. For instance, why is nobody taking up the issues of farmers and their compensation and Modi's hoodwinking of them after promising them a fair compensation? Even if any such issue is taken up, it is hardly ever sustained and keeps getting relegated to the margins. Congress has to take the biggest share of the blame on this front. But then, Congress as an organisation is hardly present on the ground even in states where they are the primary Opposition to the BJP. It's very different in BJP's case as they have radicalised youth (and the not so young) fed on anti-minority propaganda getting coached in their shakhas. When BJP supplements this breeding of hate with doses of nationalism, it looks like an attractive proposition and cause to the jobless youth in India's villages and small towns. 
 
 The ground-level cadre, who cannot see reason nor think rationally, is the biggest asset of the BJP going forward. How would some of these rump parties without booth-level workers and boots on the ground take on the organisational might of the BJP? How will parties like Congress reach out to the people beyond social media and huge rallies? For the joint Opposition to succeed in dislodging BJP, it's imperative that they come up with a positive agenda for the nation rather than convert it into a wholly negative campaign against Modi. They must then channelise these efforts into action on the ground in states where there is some level of disenchantment against BJP and Modi. Relying purely on the numbers might only lead to a counter-consolidation and make Narendra Modi stronger. There is nobody more adept at playing victim than Modi and he might be able to do that successfully once again and comeback stronger in 2019. If the Opposition wants to prevent that from happening, they will have to go back to the drawing board and prepare a host of strategies and run a positive campaign for the aspirational Indian. Beyond emphasising the failures of the current regime, they would have to sell dreams to complement their impressive numbers - only then they have a shot at winning 2019.",2018-05-24,"Karnataka verdict,Narendra Modi,Hd kumaraswamy-takes-oath,Opposition unity",What Opposition parties really need to do to take on the might of Modi ahead of 2019,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/opposition-unity-hd-kumaraswamy-takes-oath-narendra-modi-2019-general-elections-rahul-gandhi/story/1/24388.html
372,George V Skaria,"As the nation was getting back to business after a prolonged Karnataka election results opera, the  — through his pastoral letter citing “turbulent political atmosphere”, and urging priests to “pray for the country” before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls — has pushed the Catholic Church of India on a collision path with the NDA government for the second time in succession. For the uninitiated, a similar pastoral letter was issued by  last year creating an unwarranted hornets' nest. In his pastoral letter, the Gandhinagar Archbishop urged people to defeat “nationalistic forces” from taking over the country. The ruling BJP and its allies were quick to react this time terming the letter as a classic case of prejudice against the government. Defending the government, Union minister of minority affairs, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, said unequivocally, “It illustrates the bias against the government and the party. We should all pray together, so that the Church eliminates its bias against the government.” Defending the letter, rights activist and former president of the All India Catholic Union, John Dayal, reasoned during a television debate, “There is nothing wrong about the letter.” Adding further, he said, “I have travelled extensively across the country and the minorities are living in fear of the present government and its allied organisations.” The assessment by Dayal is wrong to a large extent. There have been instances of violence against Christians, but that has been dealt according to law. And in most instances the perpetrators of the crime have been punished by relevant courts of law. As far as the Christian community in India is concerned, it is largely, a peaceful minority that has always stayed within the realm of law in India. It is also a fact that a Catholic majority state like Goa has a BJP government, Nagaland, a northeastern state with a sizeable amount of Christian population has the BJP as a coalition partner, the BJP has made spectacular inroads into states like Meghalaya, Tripura, Manipur, Mizoram, etc, areas labelled to be hotbeds of Christian missionary activities. The rise of the BJP in states with Christian populations debunks the theory that Christians are being targeted or victimised. The Catholic Church needs to clarify its stand with regards to the series of pastoral letters issued by its various Archdioceses, time and again. In India, although the Catholic Church is the largest with regards to its laity and resources, other denominations like the Orthodox Syrian Church, the Protestant Church etc, also has a sizeable following. And these non-catholic churches have not reported itself to be victimised by the incumbent government till date. Denouncing the action of the Archbishop, former Congressman from Goa, Savio Rodrigues, in an open letter, states, “Unfortunately it’s the Catholic Church that acts as custodian of Jesus’s teachings that appears to be walking the path that is completely opposite to the lessons in humanity that Jesus expressed through his teachings. Instead of offering a fish are we attempting to offer the child a snake?” “With due respect to your office and your vocation as Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Delhi, I am shocked, disappointed and downright angry reading the contents of your pastoral letter,” lamented Rodrigues. Cutting across denominations and groups, the Indian Christian community has contributed in all walks of life and has never been at the cross roads with any political ideology. The community has participated in polls with the same fervour like their compatriots and elected, whoever was the best to serve them, irrespective of ideology and affiliation. Hence, it is imperative for the Christian community in India to prevail upon its clergy to desist from such pastoral communications that create fissures in the communal harmony between the Christian community and the other communities at large.",2018-05-22,"Modi government,Christians,Secularism,Delhi archbishop",Archbishop is wrong: Christians in India are not under any threat,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/delhi-archbishop-letter-christians-secularism-anil-couto-modi-politics-government-pastoral-letter/story/1/24345.html
373,Srijana Mitra Das,"General Asad Durrani has been chief of Pakistan’s ISI. He has now co-authored the   with former RAW chief AS Dulat, both spy masters in conversation with journalist Aditya Sinha. General Durrani spoke with Srijana Mitra Das about his surprising camaraderie with Dulat, how Kashmir could help bilateral cooperation — and why he thinks the USA will lose influence if India and Pakistan grow closer:  Given that he’s been chief of RAW, and you, chief of the ISI, the camaraderie between you and AS Dulat is quite a surprise — how did you both meet, became so friendly, and so trusting of each other? Wasn’t there a contradiction inherent there?  Well, we have been meeting on Track Twos for over a decade. We have written joint papers (on Intelligence Cooperation, for example) and we have talked to each other as “professionals”. No, there was no contradiction anywhere.  You discuss Kashmir in this book. Do you agree with Mr Dulat’s view, that it is now too much of a money-making operation for anyone to seriously want to stop the violence there?  I don’t think that was his main argument. He knows the place too well to come to such a bland conclusion. That Kashmir could become — because of its criticality — actually a test case for bilateral cooperation, well, both of us agreed upon that. If that or any other factor led the two countries or the region to find a better relationship, as has happened in many other parts of the world, it was certainly a possibility. Discussing various scenarios in any case was always advisable — on sensitive matters, away from the limelight.  Speaking of ""away from the limelight"", given that Nawaz Sharif's been nixed, and other politicians and media are under tight controls, is Pakistan basically under un-announced military rule today?  I do not comment on internal (or external) political matters.  Tell us this though — how efficiently is Pakistan conducting its policy on Kashmir and homegrown terrorism? Are there things you’d want to see done differently, particularly in the age of President Trump?  Considering the complexity of the situation, internal and external, and some capacity issues, Pakistan has done a reasonably good job. A few things, such as more ownership by the civilian institutions and less “kinetics” by the military, were certainly advised. Donald Trump is irrelevant — a much overrated factor.  You mention the Americans’ great strength is ""controlling the narrative"" though — could you tell us concrete instances of the same?  The first instance — that it invaded Afghanistan in response to 9/11 could be defended (though plenty of evidence exists that it was planning to do so in any case), but that it’s now there to fight “terrorism”, ensure peace, etc., is “hogwash”. It is essentially there to maintain military bases in a strategically crucial region. Turmoil in fact is helpful to justify its presence — in itself, a destabilising factor. Similarly, its acts in the Middle East are meant to create and keep chaos. Fighting the likes of Daesh is merely rationalisation... Instability in certain regions — including ours — helps the “sole superpower” to remain relevant (remember Cheney). If India and Pakistan became friends, the first to lose the pivotal third party role would be the US. “Pakistan considers India as an existential threat” is a mantra churned out by the “Beltway”. I am not aware of any informed quarter in Pakistan, which, though recognising acrimony, exalted the Indian factor thus. Another instance — the Ukraine may be conceded as “Russia’s Strategic Depth” by Stratfor; the US has convinced at least the “Official West” that Moscow was the main culprit. The list is endless, but as icing on the cake — all its sponsored reports recount all the flaws in the American policies in Afghanistan, but still conclude that, “but for Pakistan”, the world’s mightiest alliance would have succeeded! I don’t mind as long as they also concede that we were the real superpower.  While on superpowers, Osama bin Laden was found in Pakistan by the USA. There’s been speculation that Pakistan's “deep state” — or possibly, General Kayani’s circle — sold him out to the Americans. What is your view?  My assessment of that is adequately expressed in the book.",2018-05-22,"Donald Trump,India-Pakistan,ISI,Asad durrani","‘Donald Trump is irrelevant…if India-Pakistan became friends, the first to lose pivotal role would be the US’",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/isi-chief-general-asad-durrani-kashmir-india-pakistan-donald-trump-america-usa-osama-bin-laden-raw/story/1/24347.html
374,Udit Raj,"Recently, Mukesh Sawji Vania, a Dalit man, was put to  in the Sapar Industrial Area of Rajkot in Gujarat, tied up and beaten till he succumbed to his injuries. There has been a series of such gruesome incidents in other parts as well. Just a few weeks back, a Dalit boy was killed in  because, as reports stated, he was using a horse to roam about his village. Now, Gujarat is a developed state and such incidents are not even expected to happen there. But currently, in addition to the contradicting socioeconomic scenario, the confusion I find raging is over how such crimes are even happening — after all, isn’t caste a long-gone phenomenon? The truth is, no. The uneducated indulge more in physical untouchability — but the educated too are no better off at abjuring such practices. That form of discrimination appears more at the mental level. Till the 1980s and 1990s, there was a hope that caste will wither away in India with the fast pace of education and urbanisation. If people of African origin were discriminated against in, say, America, some thought, the history of these communities having been brought there from another part of the world, perhaps still being seen as outsiders, perhaps that underlay some of the violent resentment. Yet, in our case, we — the people called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes — have actually been living on this land for millennia. Why then is this feeling of caste, so brutal and so separating, simply not dying out?  There is a simple explanation. Caste is like an insurance company where, without paying a premium, certain things are secured. These include marriage, progeny, socio-cultural needs, physical security, emotional support, socialisation, etc. Besides these advantages, there are other reasons for the survival of caste — there is the theory of karma (which then enjoins a certain parasitic tendency to grow — one “superior” caste gets to enjoy the labour of others), it is backed by spiritualism, etc. In recent times, we are also seeing statements about conflicts apparently being caused due to “assertion” on the part of so-called lower castes. Yet, the puzzle remains — why is caste, so brutal and murderous, not withering away? The main reason is that no socio-cultural revolution has happened in India for this — and nor it is likely to happen. Other societies, like Europe, have seen reform after reform improving social norms after the Reformation, the Renaissance, the French Revolution, the Bolshevik uprising, etc. In these societies, change came from within and forced their governments to also change. But in India, instead of internal social churn, whenever Dalits are discriminated against, the buck is passed on to the government and the issue is linked to law and order — very conveniently, the opposition parties also thus shirk the opportunity and the responsibility to find genuine ways to tackle and annihilate caste. Of course, ruling parties also do not have such programs to do away with or dilute the caste system. We borrowed our governance system from Europe where democracy evolved — but our fault from the very beginning was to sweep caste under the carpet and blindly follow only the welfare programs of those governments — caste was never on the agenda of governance as a social evil to be broken. Rather, political parties actually started using it (barring some exceptions in Left politics). There is no hope in the future also to have caste itself annihilated — now, it has even started transgressing the boundaries of India itself. There has been much debate in Britain’s Parliament recently over the emergence of caste practices in diasporas in that country and how to fight this phenomenon. In many countries, debates are underway over making new legislation to fight caste discrimination. There have been several discussions at the Human Rights Commission in the UN and even in the US Senate. Congressional hearings on caste issues have happened several times at Capitol Hill. But, in India, we have actually not even realised how much harm has been done to this country by continuing to follow caste. Look at our history.  India has seen defeat after defeat at the hands of foreigners not on account of their superior strength or better weaponries, but due to our internal social segregation. Each caste was made intensely conscious of its so-called occupation, no matter who was ruling. For a nation fascinated with its own defeats, somehow this factor has always been overlooked. We hear of how we were colonized due to different debacles; sometimes, rival kings and selfish feudals joined hands with invaders. Sometimes, backstabbing and treachery helped outsiders invade India. Sometimes, our own horses and elephants betrayed us. Undoubtedly, all of this happened — but think, at the end of the day, how could a handful of foreigners even stay in India and rule it for so long if the common masses did not cooperate with them? A fact is, the so-called lower castes — comprising around 85 per cent of our population — were rather happy under the foreign regime as they had been so brutally discriminated against by our own people. The nation has thus paid through its past with huge losses in order to protect caste. Even today, the best of talents from the country’s entire population are not pooled together to excel in various fields including education, research, innovation, sports etc. Historically, those who worked in tanneries, with iron, etc., were never given any importance as technicians or technocrats. As a result, no advancement was seen in subjects like metallurgy, civil and mechanical engineering, etc. Had these people been given dignity — and not just the slurs of caste — they would have developed technology in their own fields and India would not have to borrow from outside today.  Yet, caste does not seem ready to die anytime soon. An anecdote — in a developed state like Gujarat, one Deepak Patel of Ahmedabad reinforces caste will stay. Deepak is a Dalit but writes his surname as “Patel”. When Deepak tried to buy a flat in Neelkanth Society, Shahi Bagh, Ahmedabad, the house was denied to him when his identity as a Dalit was revealed. “Deepak Patel” again tried to buy a house in Mahavir Hills, Gandhi Nagar — he met the same fate as before. The day there is actually real patriotic feeling in India, such walls of caste will start to break. Until then, mainly lower caste groups try to break it. Those who rule the roost in all fields do not seem terribly serious about annihilating caste. What we continue to see is the annihilation of people identified as being from certain castes.",2018-05-22,"BR Ambedkar,Caste system,Dalit,Rajkot lynching","Why Rajkot lynching is no big surprise — in India, certain castes, not caste itself, get killed",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajkot-lynching-dalit-caste-system-casteism-br-ambedkar-una-bhavnagar/story/1/24355.html
375,Anand Kochukudy,"As the results of the Karnataka Assembly elections were unfolding on May 15, I was sitting at a Malayalam news channel’s New Delhi studio as their political analyst for the day. Despite opinion polls and exit polls  , the verdict looked increasingly in favour of the BJP around 1pm, with the leads showing the saffron party surging ahead in 109 seats. After quickly walking across to the Janpath Lounge on Tolstoy Road adjacent to the studio for a quick bite, I began typing frantically on my laptop, trying to make sense of the BJP’s fine show for a 700-word article that I had committed to based on the trends. But just as I was about to finish – occasionally distracted by suited-booted gents on adjacent tables showering praises on Modi and Shah and panning the Congress in equal measure – I got a call from the studio to rejoin them at 2pm along with the crucial information that the BJP lead was now down to 104. I decided to hold my article since I didn’t want to risk cutting a sorry figure – as many analysts end up doing on such days of fluctuating fortunes (recall Bihar assembly election of 2015). That trend persisted for some time and around 3pm, the game had completely changed. To the utter shock and disbelief of one of the panellists on air, the news of Congress offering unconditional support to the JD(S) came in. The celebrations at the BJP headquarters came to a sudden halt and the Congress – which was facing an embarrassing loss minutes ago– had turned the tables on BJP. It was the kind of move that nobody expected the Congress to pull off. The drama had only begun. On air, the Marxist ideologue – who is also a seasoned journalist and former resident editor of a national daily – dubbed this move “immoral” even as I hailed it. I reasoned it would be a game changer for opposition unity and pay off for the Congress and the opposition as a whole come 2019. The ideologue took issue with my justification and lamented the eroding sense of “ethics and morality” among young journalists. Meanwhile, in Karnataka, the Congress and the JD(S) got their act together and moved their MLAs to Bangalore. Shortly after they made their claim and HD Kumaraswamy was denied appointment by Governor Vajubhai Vala, it emerged that the BJP wasn’t giving up and Yeddyurappa too would stake claim with a formal letter. On the next day (May 16), as it seemed the Governor would invite Yeddyurappa as the largest party to form the government, Congress leaders met in Delhi to chart out a plan to deal with it legally. Abhishek Manu Singhvi – who led the Congress’ charge in the Supreme Court – was out of station, and had to be rushed back to Delhi. As soon as the Congress got confirmation of the Governor’s invite to Yeddyurappa for a 9am swearing-in (pre-empting a court injunction as court proceedings begin only at 10.30am) midway through their press conference at AICC headquarters, it rushed its lawyers to the Supreme Court to seek an urgent hearing. By midnight, it was revealed that the Supreme Court would hear the matter at 1.45am. Singhvi and team argued their case valiantly but the court refused to defer or restrain the swearing-in of Yeddyurappa. Even as all this was happening in Delhi, aggressive poaching bids were being made in Bangalore for the Congress and JD(S) MLAs. By then, the MLAs had been moved to the Eagleton resort. The next day (May 17), following the swearing-in of Yeddyurappa, changes were made in the police set-up and renewed poaching bids were made after the withdrawal of security at the resort. Except for Vijayanagara MLA Anand Singh, the flock held together. I spoke to a couple of top Congress leaders, including an AICC in-charge of the state hailing from Kerala, who told me how the  on the phone was taken. Many Congress legislators from North Karnataka region, especially the Lingayat MLAs, were receiving offers of obscene sums of money and other inducements, including Cabinet ranks. The decision to record these calls, at least a dozen of them, turned out to be a “masterstroke” in hindsight, according to one of them. After an aborted plan to fly them out to Kochi following denial of clearance by the ATC, it was decided that the MLAs would be taken by road to Hyderabad. In Delhi, the next hearing of the Congress petition was scheduled for May 18 (Friday) 10.30am, and by noon, the decision of the court to move the floor test ahead to Saturday was known (some Congress leaders confided in private that they had expected it to be held only on Monday). By Friday evening, another controversial move by the Governor to nominate BJP’s KG Bopiah as pro-tem speaker, overriding the nomination of the legislature secretariat of senior-most legislator RV Deshpande, also caused considerable consternation in the Congress camp. Bopiah was incidentally the pro-tem speaker even in 2008, when the BJP’s  had helped the minority Yeddyurappa government cross the magic figure. The Congress was not ready to yield an inch this time and once again challenged the move with an interlocutory application next morning in the court, before the swearing- in proceedings were to begin in Bangalore. The court didn’t entertain it and were satisfied with the assurance given by the additional solicitor-general to telecast the proceedings live. While the BJP refused to throw in the towel even when it clearly looked like they didn’t have the numbers, nobody really knew what was going happen on the floor of the House. As “missing” Congress MLAs Anand Singh and Pratapgouda Patil eventually turned up and joined the Congress ranks in the Assembly, the speculation of Yeddyurappa resigning without facing the vote looked plausible. And that is exactly what happened, as the BJP central leadership instructed Yeddyurappa to follow that course. It was a timid end to all the political machinations and manipulations witnessed till that point. The Congress rank and file, used to successive defeats since 2014, were pleasantly shocked at the kind of dexterity and enterprise shown by the party to ward off the attempts of poaching and get the better of the BJP. Having punctured the air of invincibility around the Modi-Shah juggernaut, Congress goes into the crucial winter elections of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram with confidence. After bragging too soon of a “15th straight state win” on the evening of May 15, Amit Shah had to eat crow. The call recordings involving top BJP leaders trying to induce and bribe Congress MLAs released in the hours preceding the floor test had the BJP strategists running for cover. Congress sources revealed their strategy was set in place on May 13, a day after the election, when Congress’ Ghulam Nabi Azad contacted JD(S) spokesperson Danish Ali. As the pointsman of the JD(S) in Delhi, Ali has been a busy man at the party headquarters at VP House. He readily conceded that it was the Congress that took the lead in the negotiations. Although there have been reports that Rahul Gandhi wasn’t calling the shots in these decisions, reliable sources rubbished such claims by “vested interests”. In fact, Gandhi is supposed to have taken the call to extend unconditional support to JD(S) in the event of the Congress falling short of 100 seats. With HD Kumaraswamy away in Singapore, Sonia Gandhi picked up the phone to call JD(S) patriarch Deve Gowda and Rahul Gandhi rang up Sitaram Yechuri to request his intervention to make sure there wouldn’t be any hiccups. Even as BJP leaders now cry foul and accuse the Congress and the JD(S) of entering into an “unholy” alliance, a top BJP source admitted to me on the phone that Congress beat the BJP in taking the lead and stumped the saffron party with their uncharacteristically quick moves. Congress leaders had the good sense to anticipate the scenario of the BJP courting the JD(S) and thereby losing another Opposition party to the ranks of the NDA, like with Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) in Bihar last year. They stole a march over the BJP after touching base with the JD(S) in Delhi and flying their top political brains, Ahmed Patel and Ghulam Nabi Azad, to Bangalore a day before the counting on March 14. The top legal eagles of the party were ready to back them up in Delhi for any eventuality. For once, the Congress party functioned like a well-oiled machine and operated seamlessly between Bangalore and Delhi. The political thriller in Bangalore seems to have culminated with Yeddyurappa’s resignation and HD Kumaraswami’s swearing-in being scheduled for Wednesday. While it is highly unlikely that there would be any more hiccups when Kumaraswamy takes the floor test in the Assembly, the political theatre switches to Kairana in Uttar Pradesh, where a joint opposition candidate takes on the BJP for the by-election scheduled for May 28.  ",2018-05-20,"JD(S),BJP,Rahul Gandhi,Congress",The real reason behind how Congress made BJP look silly in Karnataka,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-elections-congress-bjp-jds-amit-shah-yeddyurappa-rahul-gandhi-kumaraswamy/story/1/24295.html
376,Sharat Pradhan,"Old habits die hard. This is especially true for politicians, of all hues. And nothing could demonstrate this better than the manner in which six former Uttar Pradesh chief ministers are fighting to circumvent an order of the Supreme Court, which asks them to  in Lucknow after demitting office. Even as the Yogi Adityanath government on May 17 issued notices to each of the former CMs – Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Rajnath Singh, Kalyan Singh and Narayan Dutt Tiwari – to vacate their bungalows within 15 days, the worthies are trying all ways to cling on to the sprawling luxurious properties in the state capital’s prime areas.  What blew the lid off this was a  made to CM Adityanath by Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Mulayam went out of his way to pay a visit to the chief minister, and suggested that the two bungalows allotted to him and his son Akhilesh may now be allotted in the names of two SP leaders – Ram Govind Chaudhary, who happens to be the leader of the opposition in the Vidhan Sabha (State Assembly), and Ahmad Hasan, who is the leader of opposition in the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council). This, he suggested, would enable him and his son to retain possession of the two houses, as Chaudhary and Hasan would continue to stay in their private homes. Even as Adityanath did not make any commitment, he is understood to have agreed to “consider” the veteran politician’s request. After all, the chief minister too was trying to find a solution to the same ticklish issue, raised by his own party’s  former chief ministers – Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh – who are holding on to two such bungalows in the state capital.  While Union home minister Rajnath Singh is the only ex UP CM to have publicly announced his decision to hand over the house to the state government, Kalyan Singh, the current governor of Rajasthan, is understood to have floated the idea to allot the house to his grandson, who is a minister in the current Yogi dispensation. Sure enough, there could be no more convenient way to retain the house. The issue would have remained under wraps if it had not hit the headlines in the local media. And no sooner had the meeting between Mulayam and Yogi become common knowledge than a manhunt was launched to identify the mole in the chief minister’s office. Eventually, two small fry at the clerical level were   and shunted out of the CM’s personal secretariat, thereby conveying how much the news had annoyed Adityanath.  It is alleged that the issue caused serious embarrassment to the chief minister simply because he was actually trying to find a subtle way to help his predecessors circumvent the apex court’s order. But now that the entire plan stands exposed, things could become difficult even for him. After all, the persistent petitioner SN Shukla (a former upright IAS officer), who was pursuing the PIL moved by his NGO, Lok Prahari, is keeping an eye on every development. Of the six former CMs, Mulayam, Akhilesh and Mayawati are truly living in official opulence.  Mulayam occupies a giant mansion spread across a plot of about 25,000sqft on Lucknow’s prime Vikramaditya Marg, his son Akhilesh has a more luxurious place standing on a bigger plot of about 50,000 sqft just next door, on which more than Rs 60 crore were spent from the state exchequer to suit the taste of the young former CM. Mayawati’s opulent estate on a nearly two-acre plot was created at a cost of about Rs 103 crore, taken out of the taxpayer’s money. And that happened not without demolition of a palatial house and a government office building on the adjoining plot. The office of the state sugarcane commissioner was also shifted to a new building. The entire episode has made it loud and clear that when it comes to common interest, even arch political rivals do not hesitate to join hands. What next move do the scheming politicians come up with remains to be seen. However, it has become evident that the former CMs will still move heaven and earth to hold on to their prized possessions.

377,Manoj Joshi,"The  ordered by the government is a poor copy of the one that was initiated by the Vajpayee government between November 2000 to May 2001. That was a carefully prepared event towards making peace in Kashmir by engaging the separatists and the militants and bypassing the Pakistanis. A lot of behind-the-scenes work with the Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) and the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) went into it. And it came apart because of systematic ISI pressure. First, after supporting it, the HM chief Salahuddin who resides in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, renounced his support. It was viewed seriously enough by the ISI that it triggered an attack on the Red Fort by Lashkar-e-Tayyeba terrorists and a suicide bombing at the headquarters of the Army’s 15 Corps in Srinagar. It led to severe infighting in the APHC and the eventual assassinations of the principal advocates of peace, HM deputy chief Abdul Majid Dar and Abdul Ghani Lone. Eventually, New Delhi threw in the towel and invited Musharraf for talks in Agra. The current non-initiation of combat operations (NICO), to give the ceasefire a more precise name, comes in a confused and chaotic circumstance, in the middle of the government’s blood and iron strategy to finish off militancy for good in the state. There is no doubt that the NICO will be a boon to the militants who have been under enormous pressure. But it has not even got token support from the militants of any stripe, or, for that matter, the so-called joint resistance leadership, who also doubles as the APHC. From Clausewitz onwards, military strategists acknowledge that military operations are a means of fulfilling political ends. In the case of the Modi government in Kashmir, it is difficult to discern any other goals other than to militarily finish off the militancy. Though the Prime Minister’s two-hour stop-over in Srinagar on Saturday to inaugurate a hydro project is being conflated as some kind of a political gesture, the fact is that there is no discernible political initiative accompanying the ceasefire. His last set of golden words, uttered while inaugurating another project in April, were his standard wordplay—“the youth of Kashmir have two ways ahead, on one hand you have tourism and on the other terrorism.” There are problems with this approach and the current NICO appears to be aimed at heading them off. In what is increasingly appearing to be a failed policy, the removal of armed gunmen from the scene is only leading to their replacement by a radicalised mass of young Kashmiris who are increasingly ready to sacrifice their lives in attacking military convoys and even tourist groups with stones. So far, rules of engagement have prevented mass casualties, but the recent lynching of a JCO and the killing of a tourist signal a situation that is slowly getting out of hand with the crowds escalating their violence using stones, Molotov cocktails. The Army is simply not trained to deal with this unless the government intends to give them the freedom to deal with the situation like the Israeli Army which does not hesitate to shoot at violent, but unarmed protestors. The difference is that while the Israeli soldiers are killing “the enemy”, Indian soldiers will be asked to fire at their own unarmed, albeit violent countrymen. The big challenge is to evolve tactics to deal with these mobs. For long it has been clear that the Army is not the right kind of force to deal with this because it is not equipped to handle violent but unarmed mobs. This is not an uncommon challenge, it is confronted by police forces across the world in Germany, France, South Korea or Brazil. The handling requires special tactics, equipment, a very high level of training and psychological conditioning and a significant mass of personnel who would have to be deployed across the Valley. Though the Modi government is an expert in appropriating ideas and icons, it seems to lack the creative ability or the executive skills to go beyond simple copying. The same seems to be the case with the ceasefire or NICO. Experience should tell us that the problem has two tracks – the Pakistani and the domestic – which must be simultaneously engaged and the process synchronised in a manner that ensures that both move at the same pace. Engaging one and not the other doesn’t work, neither does an uncoordinated procedure. More than anything else, it also requires a point man who has the prime minister’s authority. As of now, all these seem to be lacking and so, there is little chance that there will be any forward movement.

378,Surendra Kumar,"The “mentally deranged US dotard” has met his match in the “little rocket man”. US President Donald Trump and North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un have kept the world on the edge with their unpredictability and volatility. Such has been their fickleness that the US-North Korea relations have swung 180 degrees from the brink of a war to a historic face-to-face dialogue in Singapore on June 12. It is interesting to see the turn of events. Enraged by Kim’s missile tests, Trump tweeted on April 9, threatening Pyongyang of “fire and fury like of which the world has never seen”. On April 11, he upped the ante by saying: “Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully, Kim Jong-un will find another way.” In his maiden speech at the UN General Assembly on September 18, 2017, Trump said that “the rocket man was on a suicide mission”, and threatened to “destroy North Korea”. Kim didn’t hold back either. Pointing out that “a frightened dog barks louder”, he called Trump a “political heretic... unfit to hold the prerogative of Supreme Commander” and “gangster fond of playing with fire”. A day after Trump’s UNGA speech, Kim returned his compliments, he would “surely tame the mentally deranged and mentally dotard with fire”. The North Korean threats weren’t just verbal. On September 28, 2017, Pyongyang successfully launched its intercontinental ballistic missile, Hwasong-15, which David Wright, a missile expert, thought had a range of 8,078 miles that could reach Washington and other American cities on the West coast, Europe, Japan and Australia. As expected, the US, Russia, China and European countries expressed their concern. According to Melissa Hanham of the James Martin Institute of Non-Proliferation Studies, it was the North Korean way of saying “we have achieved what we wanted”. Was this the Cuban Missile Crisis moment for Trump and Kim? Like John F Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev, haven’t they pulled back from the brink of a precipice? They seem to be practising realpolitik: put maximum pressure on your opponent before going for talks, and engaging the enemy from the position of strength, not of weakness! Besides Trump and Kim, the credit for diffusing the situation should go to the Chinese and South Korean Presidents. In August 2017, Moon Jae-in said, “There must be no more war on the Korean peninsula. Whatever ups and downs we face, the North Korean situation must be resolved peacefully. I am certain the United State will respond to the current situation calmly and responsibly in a stance that is equal to ours.” It was the strongest public message to the US. Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom Trump has constantly been pushing to stop Kim from launching missiles, has twin objectives: to ensure that the beleaguered North Korean regime doesn’t collapse in spite of sanctions; and, the Trump-Kim verbal salvos don’t degenerate into an open conflict that will invariably force China to take a side. China’s crucial role is underlined by Kim’s second visit to China as early as last week. The historic summit between the North and South Korean Presidents on April 27 has gone reasonably off well, despite some last-minute hiccups. Warm handshakes, bear hugs and positive words said it all. President Moon hailed a “new era of peace” and pledged, “There will be no more war on the Korean peninsula”. But does it means the same thing about Trump and Kim? Kim shares an ambitious reunification dream. “Using one language, one culture, and one history South and North Korea will be reunited as one country, thus enjoying everlasting peace and prosperity.” In this backdrop, and given the turbulent history and interests of the US and China, only time will tell how far and how fast Moon and Kim can move. Nonetheless, they intend to “gradually realise arms reduction when the military tension is removed and trust is practically established”. A lot, however, will depend on the outcome of the Trump-Kim summit on June 12. Mindful of the fate that befell Colonel Gaddafi, total surrender by Kim of all his nuclear weapons looks unlikely. Above all, Kim will demand security of his regime. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions on Iran might heighten Kim’s apprehensions about any denuclearisation deal with the US. A drastically amended version of the Iran nuclear deal guaranteed by China, South Korea and Russia could possibly have been a workable template. As for Trump, he hasn’t opened his cards except uttering some conciliatory words about Kim after the return of three imprisoned Americans. But he realises that, thanks to strong opposition from South Korea and China, any punitive action against the North is unrealistic. In that sense, Trump’s pressure on Kim may be working to an extent, but he is equally being influenced by powers like China. And, it is still a long way before the North Korean crisis is suitably resolved. For, Kim may still trump the US.

379,Romita Datta,"In Mamata Banerjee's Bengal, all parties combined in the Opposition are not even half way close to what the ruling  . Yet, there are niggling worries that cannot be overlooked when the mother of all elections — Lok Sabha 2019 — is just around the corner. The Trinamool has virtually secured large swathes of rural Bengal, with 20,739 Gram Panchayats out of 31,814, 90 per cent Panchayat Samitis and 95 per cent Zilla Parishads of three-tier village administrative seats falling in its kitty. The BJP, the Left, the Congress and the Independents have cobbled together 9,000-odd Gram Panchayats. Mamata was happy with the results, but not without a twinge of discomfort: the BJP is in the second position, though a distant second, and is pacing up fast, especially for making some impressive footprints in the tribal belt of Alipurduar, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum and West Midnapore. The saffron party's inroads into the tribal belt of Jangalmahal (in western Bengal) and three districts of North Bengal is disturbing for the ruling party because such areas will send five to six MPs to the Lok Sabha. Mamata, on the other hand, was looking to sweep 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Anything less than that would make her a less eligible candidate to stake claim to the topmost post in the country. In fact, she is hoping to play a lead role in the 2019 elections based on the premise that hers would be the third largest party in the Lok Sabha, now that AIADMK has been split. The more the number of seats she secures for her party, the higher the chances of having a say or calling the shots in a federal coalition. Coming back to Bengal, with the winds of change beginning to blow in the tribal belt, Mamata was quick to read that her party is being rejected and her social welfare schemes — rice at Rs 2 a kilo, kanyashree, yuvashree, cycles for schoolgoing students, et al — failed to create much stir after the initial euphoria. She had held two things responsible for the growth of the BJP in Bengal's tribal zones: one, the Maoists are once again active in the regions and are using the BJP as a shield; two, since the western part of Bengal is close to the BJP-ruled Jharkhand, the saffron party is naturally reaping benefits in the form of human and other resources. Mamata also feels that the BJP-ruled Assam, Tripura and other northeastern states, with which her state shares close proximity, are largely responsible for the saffron wave. She has promised to give special attention to the grievances of the tribals to make amends. Not bad, considering the tribals’ concerns are being not being heard. The tribals, too, are driven by herd mentality in much the same way other minority communities vote. Therefore, not making timely amends could prove dangerous. That apart, the emergence of Independents as a crucial force winning 1,779 Gram Panchayats — 700 more than the Congress — is causing worry for political parties. Who are these people who braved all odds to leave a mark? Mamata thinks they are the aggrieved Trinamool supporters who can be wooed back. The Left, the Congress and the BJP have silently supported them in many places by not going into any contest with them, but that — in no way — establishes that the favour will be returned. According to political pundits, the new breed of Independents is an emerging class that is organising the disjointed, disgruntled and dissatisfied voices of the masses on a platform, which could indeed shake the political system. In the given scenario, the BJP state unit leader has said that the saffron party is eyeing the first place. The party president Amit Shah has also   for his cadres: destination Bengal. The distance between the two men is huge, but Shah is enthused about the plunge.

380,Rahul Noronha,"Would elections and their outcomes in faraway Karnataka impact the coming Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh? Not to the extent they would have in a bordering state, but the BJP emerging as the single-largest party in Karnataka has given the party’s unit in Madhya Pradesh something to feel good about after a series of bypoll defeats in that state. MP goes to the elections at the end of the year and a defeat in Karnataka would have placed the ruling party at a psychological disadvantage before the crucial polls. Conversely, a clear Congress victory in Karnataka would have placed the Congress at an advantage. Soon after the Karnataka election results were announced on May 15, the BJP’s MP unit gave credit for the increase in seats to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development agenda and party chief Amit Shah’s electoral strategies. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan described Shah as the modernday Chanakya. It seemed as if the party was going out of its way to suggest that the ModiShah team are invincible and will ensure victory for the BJP in MP too. Why are Karnataka results seemingly having an impact on MP’s polls? In an age of social media, the voter in Madhya Pradesh is getting almost real-time information of what is happening in the distant south Indian state with which it does not really have much in common. The government formation process has led to the creation of a number of jokes on the subject, which are being shared on social media too, keeping MP residents informed about developments in the southern state. But does the BJP emerging as the single largest party in Karnataka mean smooth sailing for the BJP in MP and Chhattisgarh? Clearly, no. The issues affecting MP are very different and most importantly the BJP is defending its citadels in these states where it has been in power since 2003. It is the BJP that has to deal with the impact of threeterm anti-incumbency, which may get blunted a little by the PM’s popularity and Amit Shah’s deft election strategies but cannot be wished away. The contest would be a direct one between the BJP and the Congress with no major third player to complicate matters. Of course, the BSP is a force to reckon within certain parts of MP and is said to traditionally damage the Congress’s prospects, but its impact will not be comparable to the JD(S) in Karnataka.

A senior Urdu columnist, Abdul Qadir Hassan, declared that Nawaz Sharif was an Indian agent and wrote in   that the former prime minister should leave Pakistan and move back to his original country, which is India. I counted this morning that at least 12 Urdu columnists of different newspapers had bullied Nawaz Sharif over his recent interview in one day. What was wrong in that interview? A few days ago, Nawaz Sharif gave an   where he reportedly said, “Militant organisations are active. Call them non-state actors, should we allow them to cross the border and kill 150 people in Mumbai? Explain it to me. Why can’t we complete the trial?” These few lines from a long interview became the headlines of many Indian news channels. The Indian media reported that the ousted Pakistani prime minister appeared to admit that Pakistani terrorists carried out the  and suggested that such terror attacks could have been prevented. Then, many Pakistani TV channels highlighted the statement coming from India’s defence minister  , who said that Nawaz Sharif had vindicated the stand of India on the Mumbai attacks — her statement was actually used by the Pakistani media to prove that Nawaz Sharif was speaking the language of India. Pakistan's former interior minister  was quick to issue a statement to contradict Nawaz Sharif. He said the trial against the suspects in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks was not completed because India never cooperated with Pakistan. Nisar was interior minister in Nawaz Sharif’s government from 2013 to 2017. His tone about his long-time friend suddenly changed when  . Nisar was ready to work under Nawaz Sharif — but he publicly refused to accept   as his leader. Maryam was trying to take over the party with the help of her father — but Nisar turned rebel. Nawaz Sharif lost his government in 2017 — but he did not lose his popularity. He was not defensive but aggressive. He attacked both the army and judiciary during  , and attracted huge crowds in different cities of central Punjab. Nawaz Sharif tried to make an alliance with the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) led by the former President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari — it was Zardari who had saved Nawaz’s government in 2014, when   for more than 120 days in front of Parliament with the hidden support of  There were two main objectives behind using  against Nawaz Sharif then. General Raheel Sharif wanted to save former dictator Pervez Musharraf from a treason trial ordered by the Supreme Court. Secondly, he wanted to become Field Marshal with three years extension in his service. Nawaz Sharif allowed Musharraf to run away from the treason trial, but refused to give the extension to Raheel Sharif. He appointed   as the new army chief and thought he was safe now — but unfortunately the   scandal got him. Nawaz Sharif mishandled the Panama case. Instead of dealing with it politically, he took it to the Supreme Court himself. The Supreme Court disqualified him — and he came onto the roads for public support. But this time, Zardari refused to stand with Nawaz Sharif because he felt betrayed in 2015, when he gave a statement against the-then army chief General Raheel Sharif, and Nawaz Sharif abandoned him. After no cooperation from Zardari, Nawaz Sharif tried to make a deal with the military establishment through his old friends in Saudi Arabia, who had also played an important role in his deal with Musharraf in 2000. However, this time, the Saudis were also angry with Nawaz Sharif. The Saudis wanted the Pakistan Army to fight against Yemen — Nawaz Sharif only gave them the services of General Raheel Sharif, but did not provide army troops. A few months ago, Nawaz Sharif had stopped criticising the army and only targeted the Supreme Court — but this strategy backfired. The army stood behind the Supreme Court and refused to make any backdoor deals with Nawaz Sharif. Nawaz Sharif again started criticising the army, using phrases such as “unseen forces”. Many around Nawaz tried to advise him that he should not confront the army directly and wait for elections instead; once his party would get a majority in Parliament, they could revert the laws through which he was disqualified. But Nawaz Sharif never listened to the doves within his party. He decided to pressurise the army by speaking about 26/11. His main objective was to get international support. He said nothing new about the Mumbai attacks — but perhaps his timing or selection of words was wrong. Now, his opponents like Imran Khan are bashing him, asking why Nawaz spoke about Ajmal Kasab and never spoke about Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was allegedly sent by India to organize terrorism in Pakistan. The government of his own party came under major pressure to condemn his statement. An emergency meeting of the  was called, chaired by PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. This meeting clearly condemned the statement made by Nawaz Sharif. After the meeting, PM Abbasi was apparently summoned by his leader Nawaz Sharif. PM Abbasi was reportedly told pointblank by Nawaz Sharif that he will reject the NSC statement. The PM was left confused. He never wanted to give an impression that he was backstabbing his leader in difficult circumstances. He called an emergency press conference in PM House and claimed Nawaz Sharif was misquoted by  . He tried to save his leader by throwing the blame onto the newspaper — but Nawaz Sharif never contradicted his interview. That's further complicated the situation — now, it is not the army but the prime minister who is embarrassed and the whole PML-N is really in trouble. The Provincial Assemblies of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have adopted resolutions against Nawaz Sharif — many petitions have bee I can differ with Nawaz Sharif on many issues — but I can’t support a treason trial against him. Treason allegations against political opponents are an old tradition. Military dictator General Ayub Khan declared Fatima Jinnah (the sister of Muhammad Ali Jinnah) a traitor and an Indian agent when she contested the Presidential election against him in 1965. Sheikh Mujibur Rehman (father of Hasina Wajid) supported Fatima Jinnah — so he was also declared a traitor. These treason allegations never did any good to Pakistan — such allegations even changed the geography of Pakistan in 1971. In fact, first of all, the treason trial of former dictator Pervez Musharraf should be completed — only then should our “patriots” think about others. If we can’t complete the trial against Musharraf, who is an absconder, then we should stop blaming a three-time prime minister for allegedly committing treason. Musharraf abrogated the Constitution twice. Nawaz Sharif never abrogated the Constitution once. We should now move on smoothly to the coming elections. Nawaz Sharif may go behind bars in corruption cases soon. He is trying to give an impression that he will go to jail not for corruption but due to his political stand against the military establishment. He may not address big rallies after a few weeks — but ""Nawaz, the traitor"" will be a subject of the election rallies of Imran Khan and Asif Zardari. Imran is sure that he will become the next PM of Pakistan and he is committed to having Nawaz Sharif tried for treason — but I think this will be a blunder. Instead of wasting time on treason trials, the next government must take measures to complete the Mumbai trial as soon as possible and stop the cross-border movement of both Ajmal Kasabs and Kulbhushan Jadhavs who created hatred between Pakistan and India.  ",2018-05-17,"Nawaz Sharif,Mumbai terror attacks,Imran Khan,Exclusive",Deep (state) trouble for Nawaz Sharif — 26/11 comments could see former PM tried for treason,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/nawaz-sharif-26-11-mumbai-attacks-treason-trial-imran-khan-pakistan-pm-shahid-khaqan-abbasi/story/1/24219.html
382,Anand Kochukudy,"In an appalling but expected turn of events, the  to take oath as the state's chief minister. It was already rumoured that the governor had taken a decision to this effect much before it was finally confirmed with a communiqué by the Raj Bhavan around 9pm on May 16. It was also inexplicable that the news was initially broken by Karnataka BJP’s official Twitter handle. But almost on cue, the Congress high command in New Delhi reacted swiftly to move an urgent petition seeking a hearing in the night to try and prevent the swearing-in. By midnight, it was revealed that the chief justice of India, Dipak Misra, had consented to an urgent hearing. The bench constituted by the CJI to hear the matter included justices AK Sikri, SA Bobde and Ashok Bhushan. The dramatic hearing began around 2am and had Congress's Abhishek Manu Singhvi representing the appellants and attorney general KK Venugopal and additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta representing the Union government. Former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi was assumed to be representing BS Yeddyurappa. The Congress’s case was that the decision of the governor inviting BS Yeddyurappa to be appointed as the chief minister of Karnataka and granting him 15 days to prove his majority was unconstitutional, arbitrary, illegal and violative of Article 14. Arguing his case, Singhvi referred to the   (referring to paragraph 4.11.05) wherein it is mentioned that “the governor, while going through the process of selection described above, should select a leader who, in his (governnor's) judgement, is most likely to command a majority in the Assembly”. Justice Sikri shot back with paragraph 4.11.04 of the commission’s recommendation where the order of precedence to be accorded is explicitly given. The governor should select a chief minister from among the following parties or group of parties by sounding them, in turn, in the order of preference indicated: 1) An alliance of parties that was formed prior to the elections. 2) The single largest party staking a claim to form the government with the support of others, including ""independents"". 3) A post-electoral coalition of parties, with all the partners in the coalition joining the government. 4) A post-electoral alliance of parties, with some of the parties in the alliance forming a government and the remaining parties, including “independents” supporting the government from outside. 
 
 Justice Sikri asked Singhvi: “You (Congress) are at three but your case is that they (BJP) are not at two?” To a layman like me, it struck me as odd Abhishek Singhvi referring to the Sarkaria Commission’s recommendations since it was already being cited in the media as part of BJP’s defence of the governor’s stand. When justice Sikri referred to the court approving the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission in Arunachal Pradesh in former CM Nabam Tuki’s case, Singhvi cited examples where a combination of parties was given preference over the single largest party. Meghalaya, Manipur, Goa, Delhi (2013), Jammu and Kashmir being some of the recent precedents. But Singhvi thereafter referred to the   — though he did not refer to the SR Bommai judgement (1994). The basis for limiting governor’s discretionary power was laid down by a seven-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court in the landmark  It was further refined by the court in the Rameshwar Prasad case in January 2006, when a five-judge bench had adjudicated: “There is nothing wrong in post-poll adjustments and when ideological similarity weighs with any political party to support another political party though there was no pre-poll alliance, there is nothing wrong in it.” The Rameshwar Prasad judgement goes on to say, “If a political party, with the support of other political party or other MLAs, stakes claim to form a government and satisfies the governor about its majority to form a stable government, the governor cannot refuse formation of government and override the majority” Coming back to the pre-dawn proceedings, Singhvi also contested the governor’s decision to give Yeddyurappa 15 days to prove his majority. In his submissions on behalf of the Union government, attorney-general KK Venugopal tried to argue that “anti-defection law would apply on the MLA-elects only after they were sworn in on the floor of the House”, to which justice Sikri responded with, “does that mean all the suitcase exchange is possible before they are sworn in? That's impermissible"". As a keen political observer, I couldn’t but conclude that this could have been BJP’s rationale all along to emerge victorious as and when the floor test is held. When the bench sought to know from the A-G the grounds on which Yeddyurappa staked claim to form the government, he referred to the letter submitted to the governor dated May 15 and 16 by Yeddyurappa. But it wasn’t available for the court to inspect and the court realised that respondent BS Yeddyurappa wasn’t represented in the court. Mukul Rohatgi had clarified that he was not representing Yeddyurappa but ""some BJP MLAs from Karnataka who woke him up from sleep"". In fact, Rohatgi referred to the loss of sleep at least four times during the proceedings leaving one to wonder if it was a deliberate strategy on his part to evoke similar sentiments from the bench. When justice Sikri proceeded to make an oral observation that they wouldn’t restrain the swearing-in, Abhishek Singhvi interjected with: “If Yeddyurappa comes with the letters and the court finds there is no merit in my case, I am out. Else I am in. But once he is sworn in then the whole thing will have to be reversed."" He also made an issue out of Mukul Rohatgi representing Yeddyurappa in proxy. Singhvi also appealed to the bench to defer the swearing-in pending the bench inspecting the letters submitted by Yeddyurappa to the governor. In the end, the court decided not to defer the swearing-in, but made it conditional on the A-G producing the letters Yeddyurappa wrote to the governor and pending the decision of the court in this petition. A notice was issued to the respondents and the case is slated to be heard tomorrow (May 18) at 10.30am. While it is certainly commendable that the Supreme Court heard the petition urgently and made Yeddyurappa's swearing-in conditional, it wasn’t clear why the swearing-in couldn’t be deferred till the bench was convinced the decision taken by the governor is consistent with law. The discretionary powers conferred on the governor cannot certainly be arbitrary and has to be exercised within the constitutional norms and conventions guiding the exercise of such discretion. It is also well established in law that constitutional conventions are just as binding on the governor as the legal provisions enshrined in the Constitution. Didn’t the court end up giving a window to Yeddyurappa to conjure up the numbers through illegitimate means by not deferring his swearing-in? It has come to light that Yeddyurappa swiftly nominated an Anglo-Indian member to the House today to bolster his numbers. It also gives the BJP a fillip to indulge in poaching and  to further improve their tally. One only hopes that the court will arrive at a definite conclusion tomorrow (on the basis of Yeddyurappa’s letters) if the decision of the governor to swear him in was arbitrary and unconstitutional. You only need to apply common sense to arrive at a conclusion that the BJP doesn’t have the numbers; the cumulative tally of Congress and JD(S) is six more than the halfway mark. And the Rameshwar Prasad judgment settles it beyond doubt.  ",2018-05-17,"Karnataka,BJP,Governor,Yeddyurappa",Why BJP shouldn't have been allowed to form government in Karnataka,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bs-yeddyurappa-swearing-in-governor-vajubhai-vala-bjp-karnataka-supreme-court-cji/story/1/24227.html
383,Sahil Joshi,"Karnataka   invited BS Yeddyurappa to form the government stating that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has emerged as the single-largest party in the state elections. The Congress has cried foul over the development saying that despite the Janata Dal Secular-Congress alliance having more MLAs, they were not invited by the governor to form the government, who acted in a partisan manner. Reacting to the charge, BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad reminded the Congress of its own ""dubious past"". He said the Congress didn't have the moral right to question the governor now over his actions. I want to point out the same through the philosophy of karma in Hinduism - what goes around, comes around. Congress' karma in using the governor's office to dismiss Opposition parties and governments in several states has now backfired on the party. But what is important to note here is that while   might have helped parties gain temporarily, in the long run, people involved in such practices have had to pay a heavy price. BJP has a lot to learn from the past. Here are some of the examples for the party from history. The first elected communist government to come to power in India was in Kerala under the leadership of EMS Namboodiripad. The year was 1957. The then Congress government at the Centre dismissed the government in 1959 under the pretext of liberation struggle. Sources claimed that the influence of US intelligence agency, CIA, was also the reason behind Congress' decision to dismiss the government. Namboodiripad was opposed by an organised opposition, which included the Catholic Church in Kerala, Nair Service Society and Indian Muslim League, backed by the Indian National Congress. This was the first regionally formed government in a state of India which didn't have the Congress in power. After dismissing the communist government, Congress did come to power with the support of the Praja Socialist Party but couldn't reduce the presence of communists in Kerala. Kerala has remained a communist bastion since then. Namboodiripad became the chief minister again in the late 1960s under a coalition government and served a term of around two-and-a-half years. The first non-Congress chief minister of AP was NT Rama Rao of the newly formed Telugu Desam Party in 1983. Suddenly, in 1984 when Rama Rao was abroad for a heart surgery, Indira Gandhi through the then governor dismissed the government. The then finance minister, N Bhaskar Rao, claimed he had the support of majority TDP MLAs and it was accepted by the governor. Upon his return post his surgery, Rama Rao staged claim to the chief minister's chair saying unconstitutional methods were used to dismiss his government. The governor, Thakur Ram Lal, didn't budge. He was finally was replaced with Shankar Dayal Sharma after which Rama Rao was reinstated as the chief minister. Suresh Mehta was the chief minister of Gujarat in 1996 when Shankersinh Vaghela of the BJP claimed he had the support of 40 MLAs. The then governor asked Mehta to prove his majority on the floor of the house but before that could happen Opposition MLAs exchanged blows in the Assembly following which the United Democratic Front government at the Centre entered the fray. Deve Gowda, the then prime minister, recommended dismissal of the Mehta government and sought President's Rule in the state. The then president Shankar Dayal Sharma signed the order. Vajubhai Vala, then a minister in the state, lost his ministry. Then senior BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee had cited that PM Deve Gowda had betrayed him even after assuring that the Centre wouldn't intervene into the affairs of Gujarat. In Andhra Pradesh, Rama Rao came back to power in 1984 and till date his party Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has remained the most dominant party in the state with Congress nearing extinction in the state. Even in the newly formed Telangana, Congress has an insignificant presence. The same happened in Gujarat, Shankersinh Vaghela joined the Congress after betraying BJP but could never become the chief minister again. The BJP has since then been the party winning Gujarat and gave rise to current Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while Congress has been restricted to a marginal role in the state. This could well have been the first scam where a group of members of Parliament from the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) were accused. On July 28, 1993, JMM MPs along with Janata Dal, cast their votes to defeat the no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha against the then coalition government of PV Narsimha Rao. The Central Bureau of Investigation had registered a case against the MPs after reports by media regarding the scandal. The judgement came in 2014. However, the Supreme Court decided to take a fresh look at the case since the matter was high-profile and controversial. The court granted immunity to the accused MPs who had accepted bribes to vote and save the Narsimha Rao government. Rao who was called the champion of liberalisation of Indian economy couldn't get a second chance while Congress couldn't come to power for the next two decades till 2003. When it came to power, it was with the support of a number of allies. In the year 2000, the Shiv Sena-BJP combine occupied the Opposition benches and it was then that an attempted coup to overthrow the Vilasrao Deshmukh government was spearheaded by the then Sena leader Narayan Rane. Around eight to nine Congress-NCP MLAs were abducted by Rane and his men to overthrow the Deshmukh-run Congress-NCP government. Somehow one of the Congress MLAs managed to flee and the attempt failed. The attempt invited a severe backlash. Not only did the Congress-NCP alliance return to power in 2004 and 2009 but even in 2014 elections, Sena was reduced to a much lesser margin and could gain votes only because of the Modi wave and being in coalition with the BJP. Narayan Rane, the man behind the year 2000 plan, dreamt of becoming the chief minister of Maharashtra then defected from Sena in 2005 and joined Congress. He had to quit Congress recently after which he wanted to join BJP but had to settle only with a Rajya Sabha berth after announcing his own political outfit. The men behind such constitutionally immoral attempts - whichever party they came from - have suffered political obscurity. Their parties too have suffered in the process. People's mandate does matter and this addition, subtraction, defections lead to loss of credibility among the general voters. Contrary to popular belief, voters do not have limited memories. When the time comes, they make their voices and votes count.",2018-05-17,"BJP,Congress,Karnataka elections,Karnataka verdict","In Karnataka's CM race, BJP must not forget how Congress' past came back to haunt it",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-verdict-karnataka-elections-congress-bjp-jds-horse-trading-narendra-modi-indira-gandhi/story/1/24226.html
384,Sushant Sareen,"Nothing exemplifies the sheer vacuity on Kashmir that exists among the policy-makers in New Delhi than the remarkably fatuous decision to declare a   in Kashmir. Not only do the ground realities in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir militate against such an ill-thought out move, but also the assumptions underlying this step are, to say the least, utterly stupid. Far from this move preparing the ground for a return to normalcy, it will prepare the ground for an escalation in violence. Worse, instead of sending a message that the Indian state cares for the public in Jammu and Kashmir, the message that will filter among separatist and terrorist sympathisers is that the Indian state has reached the end of imagination, run out of steam, lost the will to stay the course and dismantle both the physical and psychological infrastructure of militancy as well as the ecosystem that sustains it. At the very least, the ceasefire will fritter away the gains of the last few months against the terrorists. At a time when the pressure was becoming unbearable and the terrorists were finding their space constricting by the day, the government in its foolishness has decided to give another lease of life to the terrorists. The attitude of the Indian state is akin to that of a Bollywood hero, who, after felling the villain doesn’t finish him off while he is lying on the floor; on the contrary, the hero picks up the villain and allows him to take another shot at him before he socks him back to the ground again, and repeat. This Prithviraj Chauhan syndrome of chivalry seems to smother all good sense, not just among Bollywood fight-masters but among Indian policy makers as well. Not only will the ceasefire now give space to terrorists to regroup, re-equip, re-train and restore their networks and supply chains, it will undermine the confidence of the pro-India elements in the Valley. Just a few days back, a source in the Valley had very worriedly inquired if the Government was once again fall into the ceasefire trap - he was very clear that if such a ceasefire was declared, it would deal a body blow to the fight against the terrorists and separatists. He complained that the momentum generated by the NIA raids on the terror finance networks had already ground to a halt. The initial action against the terror financiers hadn’t been followed up. His own analysis was that this was because further action would probably lead to serving ministers and officials of the government. The ceasefire means that not only will the terror finance networks not be touched - even the armed militants will remain unmolested. An even more disturbing input has come from a colleague who revealed that a backchannel was opened with the separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani a few weeks back - and the ceasefire proposal was reportedly discussed with him. Anyone who thinks that a rabid Islamist and a declared Pakistan supporter like Geelani can be won over and made a partner in peace is dangerously delusional. Instead of helping bring peace, Geelani would use such an outreach to increase his leverage, not just with the government, but also inside Kashmir with the rest of the separatist politicians and the militant cadre, as well as his Pakistani overlords. But explaining this to the impervious — and imperious — mandarins in the Home Ministry is tougher than teaching rocket science to a primary school student. A ceasefire would make sense if, after having established ascendancy over the adversaries, a sort of face saving was being offered to open negotiations. Although the security forces are on the ascendant, the enemy isn't suing for peace. More importantly, there is no one to negotiate with, unless of course, some genius thinks that the Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) will be amenable to entering into a dialogue because of this ""goodwill"" gesture. Aside the fact that the JRL controls neither the street nor the gun, the idea of catapulting this bunch to political centre-stage is mind-boggling. If anything, the aim of the Indian state should be to marginalise and eliminate these people - not give them pride of place, much less a veto, over what happens in Kashmir. Already, the guys with guns have rubbished the ceasefire. The   (LET) has “asserted that cease-fire is no option and no thought can be given on such compromise. We deem it as sin and disgrace to the sacrifices put up in the struggle. We are the heirs of the martyrs. Opting for such choice is treachery to blood of martyrs and there is no disgrace as such.” It is equally unlikely that the Jihad-infused and ISIS/ISI inspired Kashmiri fighters will have any use for this ceasefire. With the enemy combatants having no obligation to reciprocate a unilateral ceasefire, asking the “security forces not to launch operations” is tantamount to switching them from an offensive mode to a defensive mode. In other words, instead of the security forces pro-actively hunting down terrorists, the patriotic government of India has forced them to become the hunted and retaliate only if attacked. The initiative will henceforth be with the terrorists rather than the security forces - a classic recipe for disaster in any anti-insurgency and counter-terrorism operation. But the security of the forces, who are already fighting with one hand tied behind their back, doesn’t apparently bother North Block, especially its babus who haven’t heard a shot fired in all their lives. Worse, the formulation by the babus of the Home Ministry who have declared that the “decision [has been] taken to help the peace-loving Muslims observe Ramzan in a peaceful environment” suggests that the hostilities in Kashmir were the result of the actions of security forces - not that of the attacks by terrorists. Even the Pakistanis would have found it difficult to come up with such drivel. For the government to say that it expects cooperation “to help Muslim brothers and sisters to observe Ramzan peacefully and without any difficulties” is akin to saying that the operations of security forces (which, for all intents and purposes, were against belligerents and their supporters) were actually against “peace loving Muslims”. What were those who drafted the Home Ministry statement thinking? Equally galling is the fact that the entire statement talks of ""Muslims"" and not Kashmiris. Strange, that a secular country is now deciding its security policy on the basis of religion, instead of national security imperatives. The heroic assumption, or the snake oil that has been bought by the Centre - that this will “help to isolate the forces that bring a bad name to Islam” — betrays the total lack of comprehension of the dynamics of what is happening in Kashmir. For a country that has been confronted with the Islamist-driven insurgency for nearly three decades to take a gamble on the basis of such inanities is a confirmation of how nothing has been learnt in all these years.",2018-05-16,"Terrorism,Kashmir,Ceasefire,Ramzan","Kashmir's Ramzan ceasefire is total foolishness, which will only hurt our security forces",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/ramzan-ceasefire-kashmir-pakistan-terrorism-let-hafiz-saeed/story/1/24202.html
385,Amitabh Srivastava ,"Tej Pratap Yadav often describes himself as a unique politician with both his parents, father Lalu Prasad and mother Rabri Devi, having served as chief ministers of Bihar. On Saturday, when he tied the nuptial knot with Aishwarya Rai, it added one more former chief minister to his extended family tree. Daughter of RJD legislator Chandrika Rai, Aishwarya is also the granddaughter of a former chief minister, Daroga Prasad Rai, who ruled Bihar for 310 days in 1970. However, in the marriage function involving two families with three former chief ministers in their family tree, Nitish Kumar, a political rival of the RJD family, was the only serving chief minister who was in attendance to witness the couple. Though many of Lalu’s avowed friends — from Mamata Banerjee to the Gandhis — could not make it, but Nitish, a political rival, turned up with flowers in hand. Beyond the marriage, what caught everyone’s attention was the fact that the occasion saw Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar meeting “bada bhai” Lalu Prasad after a gap of 10 months. Since July 26, when Nitish broke away from the Grand Alliance to rejoin hands with the BJP, he has been at the receiving end of unmitigated bitter criticism on a daily basis from his former alliance partners. In addition to RJD spokesmen, Lalu’s sons, Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav, who ironically calls him Nitish chacha, have been attacking the chief minister regularly, a tirade seen both aggressive and intimidating in equal ounces. All this, however, did not stop Nitish from visiting Lalu’s family. Attending a marriage in the family of a political rival was a warm gesture from Nitish. As he reached the marriage stage at Patna’s Veterinary Ground to offer his blessings, he walked straight to Lalu Prasad and held his hands. The RJD boss, who was out on parole from judicial custody in Jharkhand and is not keeping well, too got up and shook hands. As Nitish flashed a warm smile, Lalu for some moments looked a bit inscrutable but soon the chief minister’s warmth caught him up and the RJD chief too smiled back. Nitish occupied a sofa along with Rabri Devi and spoke to her for some time. Nitish then spoke to Lalu’s eldest daughter Misa Bharti, a Rajya Sabha MP. One by one, all seven daughters of Lalu’s came forward to speak a few words with the Bihar chief minister. Nitish recalled regularly seeing Lalu’s daughters when they were children and said it was after a long time that he was meeting all of them. All in all, he seemed warm and perfectly at peace with himself. Soon after, when Tej Pratap and Aishwarya walked on to the stage, Nitish blessed them, handing over a bouquet of red roses to them. Those who were present later described Nitish as a perfect politician with an infectious charm. Not only governance, the credit for his long innings also goes to the new caste-neutral social base that he methodically created, going beyond the traditional hegemonic groups like Brahmins and Bhumihars, and more recently, Yadavs and Paswans. During an exclusive conversation with the Bihar chief minister earlier, I noticed Nitish carefully scooping out a measured, quarter spoon sugar to add to his steaming cup of tea. “Tea has a special taste. Any more sugar will spoil it,” he said matter of factly. Whether it’s tea, governance or being a gentleman politician, the Bihar chief minister has set high standards for him.

386,Colonel Vivek Chadha,"The government of India has asked security forces not to launch operations in Jammu and Kashmir to enable ""peace loving Muslims to observe Ramzan in a peaceful environment"". The  from the government came a few days after the chief minister of the state, Mehbooba Mufti, and most political parties made the appeal. 
 
 In the past, a similar initiative had been taken by the Atal Bihar Vajpayee government to negotiate peace with the Hizbul Mujahideen in the year 2000, which ultimately failed to bring peace to the state. The prevailing internal security situation in J&K indicates growing concern on three counts: steady increase in local militant recruitment and violence; repeated attempts by mobs to resort to violence and disrupt ongoing  ; and growing frustration among some segments of the youth, resulting in the creation of an emotional disconnect with the state. This hardening of attitudes on part of the separatists and protesting youth, resultantly led to stringent measures by security forces, which had become the target of violent mobs, at times to the extent of being lynched and getting seriously injured. The recent past witnessed a series of encounters, with several terrorist leaders being neutralised. This created an operational momentum in favour of security forces. The decision to stop the initiation of operations, except in self-defence or to protect the population in an area, is always fraught with operational risks. Therefore, the discomfort of security forces with such initiatives is understandable. From their perspective, such measures provide armed groups a breather, allowing them to regroup and strengthen. This enhances their residual capability and gives them the ability to hit back harder over time. Considering these circumstances, the appeal for a ceasefire and the acceptance of the same by the government needs closer examination, especially since this is likely to receive both support and criticism in the days to come. The decision must have been a tough call for the government given the possibility of its failure to yield desired results. However, it is only the political leadership of the state, which can and must initiate such bold steps with an aim to create a disruptive impact. Despite difficult circumstances, several possible reasons can be ascribed to the decision. One, the decision can reverse the negative tide and give peace a renewed chance. It can be argued that terrorists should have declared ceasefire first. Contrary to this argument, the government has a taken the high moral ground by taking this step, which is essential under circumstances in which perceptions matter. Two, this move will discredit any segment among the separatists or terrorists which refuses to reciprocate the move. Therefore, the responsibility for violence and unrest shall rest solely on those supporting disruption. Three, the move will help reach out to the youth of the state directly. This is critical under the prevailing conditions, where many among them do not see the separatists as their representatives. This will create the requisite psychological bridge to further facilitate peace initiatives. Four, the measure also has wide ranging political support within Kashmir. This will help bring together all peace-loving forces in a united move to initiate change against the negative sentiment. Five, the non-initiation of operations initiative on the eve of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to J&K creates the necessary sentiment for him to reach out to the youth of the state directly. Given his ability to create such a connect, the decision creates the very opportunity that can usher change. Six, the decision allows for all affected segments of the society to step back and possibly re-evaluate their position. This will stall the cycle of violence that was snowballing to disturbing levels. It will also provide the opportunity and conditions to try the option of dialogue in pursuit of lasting peace. Seven, Ramzan is a time of fasting and prayers. The step taken by the government will blunt the propaganda that tends to give a religious colour to decisions of the state. It will also initiate the necessary emotional opening for seeking peace. An internal security situation will always present decision dilemmas for the government, especially in states like J&K. However, if the solution to such situations is considered political, then the government of the day must receive full support for taking the initiative to give peace a change, even if it comes along with the obvious accompanying risk of terrorists receiving a breather. This is where the security forces must not only support this initiative but also sensitise the rank and file to the larger cause for which they have and will continue to serve the nation selflessly.",2018-05-17,"Kashmir crisis,Ramzan ceasefire,Militancy in kashmir,Kashmir ceasefire",Why everyone must support Modi government's Ramzan ceasefire in Kashmir,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kashmir-ceasefire-ramzan-ceasefire-militancy-in-kashmir-bjp-stone-pelters-mehbooba-mufti-militants/story/1/24206.html
387,Romita Datta,"As the  started pouring in on May 15, Mamata Banerjee at 11.16am tweeted that had the Congress joined hands with the JD(S), things would have been different, ""very different"". 
 
 A few hours later, the Congress and JD(S) were seen joining hands in front of the camera and pledging to go to the governor and stake claim to form the next government. Did the Congress and the JD(S) take the hint? An alliance, which seemed impossible before the election, took just a few hours to be in motion. Even the Congress was ready to vacate the post of the chief minister to the JD(S). Mamata must have had smiled to herself, having played the ""lead role"" in trying to stop the BJP from coming to power in Karnataka. But at the same time she wasted no time in blaming the Congress for not going for a pre-poll alliance. In doing so, she yet again made it clear that Congress was at fault and failed to get the pulse of the voters. The fact that the JD(S) has got a good number of seats, indicates that a joint platform of the Congress and the JD(S) would have had an edge over the BJP, and the alliance would have secured majority. By pointing this out, Mamata also succeeded in showing the Congress as a less dependable political party, which is egoistic and full of itself. Earlier, when the Tripura elections gave a clear mandate in favour of the BJP, Mamata was the first to point out that the saffron party could have been stopped, if the Congress would have entered into an alliance with the independents, tribals and other parties. She made it clear that the Congress was playing a spoilsport and "" "". The idea was to start a trail of thought and political debate as to whether it would be politically wise to go with the Congress, which lacks the acumen and the far-sightedness to gauge the political situation. It was a clear case of denouncing Rahul and his ability to do political thinking. Moreover, by accusing Rahul Gandhi of having given oxygen to the BJP, Mamata Banerjee helped stoke the doubt in people's mind whether it would be wise and pragmatic to go with the Congress under the new AICC president. Mamata has strong reservations against Rahul Gandhi and being led by him is something she will not agree. In order to avoid such a situation, she floated the idea of a ""Federal Front"", two years before the 2019 polls. She is trying to bring all regional parties under the umbrella of a federal front in a move to isolate the UPA and win away its partners, which are also not happy with it. After the Karnataka polls, by tweeting that message, she sent another signal to the national leaders that the Congress under the leadership of Rahul will dither and miss the bus, as it did in the past, but will never make amends.  ",2018-05-15,"JD(S),Congress,Mamata Banerjee,Karnataka Assembly polls","Karnataka election: If JD(S) is the 'kingmaker', Mamata Banerjee is the matchmaker",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-assembly-polls-bjp-lead-mamata-banerjee-congress-jds-alliance-united-opposition/story/1/24173.html
388,Makarand R Paranjape,"As I write this column, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has a convincing lead in the Karnataka hustings, is still a few seats short of securing a clear majority. Of the 222 constituencies which went to the polls on May 12, the BJP has won or is  , according to the Election Commission. What makes matters somewhat complicated should the BJP not cross the half-way mark on its own is that in this three-cornered contest between the BJP, Congress, and Janata Dal (Secular), other players seem to be likely to win only two or three seats. Dozens of small parties, including the CPI and CPI(M), not to speak of the scores of Independent candidates, have been totally wiped out. The margin for negotiation — some would say horsetrading — is thus limited. Will the JD(S) play “kingmaker” or “heartbreaker”? The Congress has already accepted defeat: G Parameshwara, president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, said: “We accept the mandate of the people. We bow our heads to the verdict. We don’t have numbers to form government.” Of course, that’s not the end of it. He continues: “The Congress has offered to support JD(S) to form government.” It is this feeler that opens the door to a non-BJP government in the state. It is another matter that the same gentleman boasted just a couple of days back, “Congress will cross 112- seat mark very easily.” Indian elections have been known to make the proudest bite the dust. One of these is ousted chief minister Siddaramaiah, who lost in Chamundeshwari and barely scraped through in Badami. He has announced that he is to meet the state Governor at 4pm. He will have to eat humble pie because he categorically ruled out a post-poll alliance with the JD(S). We must not forget how he was kicked out of the JD(S) by the redoubtable HD Deve Gowda because he posed a challenge to the latter’s son, Kumaraswamy. Interestingly, as we come closer to the crunch, the major actors have turned silent on social media. Siddaramaiah’s last tweet was on May 9 and Amit Shah has remained mum for the last 24 hours. Given the BJP’s track record in forming governments in states where they did not have a clear majority, not to mention the fact that they rule at the Centre, there is almost no doubt that they will capture Karnataka too. The party has a formidable team of strategic thinkers and negotiators, in addition to charismatic national leaders to ensure that they cross the finishing line. The BJP forming the government would also be in keeping with Rajdharma or the order of things. After all, there is no other way of interpreting this verdict but as a vote against the ruling Congress. The JD(S), we must not forget, is a distant third. It does not enjoy the mandate of the people. Therefore, the people of Karnataka would not like them to form the government. That is all the more reason why an alliance with the JD(S) for the BJP is nothing short of disastrous. Being out of power for so long, the former is likely to exact more than its pound of flesh in return for its support. This will severely damage the reputation of the senior member of the alliance. In the case of the BJP, if the experience of the past when the JD(S) betrayed it is anything to go by, such alliances are counter-productive. In fact, the BJP being a junior partner even in Jammu and Kashmir has only diminished its stature. What is absolutely clear from the verdict, however, is the immense power and popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He is a political phenomenon of the likes India has not seen in a very long time. I have said in the past and do not hesitate to repeat it: I consider him India’s most important leader since Mahatma Gandhi. Modi is a game-changer. Though an outsider to Karnataka, he managed to sway the voters away from the Congress. Yeddyurappa played little more than a distant second-fiddle to him. Modi’s charisma is so great that he wins elections all over India almost on his own. This is also somewhat dangerous because it centralises power and authority in the figure of a single individual. In any healthy democratic polity second and third-tier leadership are absolutely essential. The BJP’s win in Karnataka, many observers have asserted, is the prelude to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Whether this is true or not, what is indubitable is that the party seems all set to rule 21 of India’s 29 states. The Congress, as Modi had sarcastically quipped in one of his election rallies, has been reduced to “PPP” — Punjab, Puducherry and Parivaar.” It is also salutary to remember that the Congress’s attempts to divide the Lingayat votes by declaring them as a non-Hindu minority religion have failed. Caste and community considerations may not have been cleaned out in Karnataka, but the magic of Modi has certainly overturned, if not overridden them.

389,Nivedita Khandekar,"It was four summers ago when Narendra Modi, the then prime-ministerial candidate of the BJP, had made an emotional statement. He was in Varanasi to file his nomination for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Knowing that the Ganga holds a special place in the collective psyche of India’s majority, Modi had carefully chosen his words and added that emotional touch. Later, that line was perfectly exploited to the hilt by the BJP’s publicity machinery.  were: “  (I have been called here by Mother Ganga).”  The first step that Modi took came after his ministers took oath. The name of the ministry responsible for Ganga was  to “Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation”. Also, the earlier National Ganga River Basin Authority was dissolved, and a National Ganga Council was proposed. But  issues prompted the government to convert National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) into an overarching authority. But as the Modi government completes four years, there are no signs of a clean Ganga. A project that the prime minister claimed was close to his heart and one for which he has taken personal interest has been lagging seriously behind schedule. The initial years were almost wasted when Uma Bharti was the minister for water resources and Ganga rejuvenation. Since Nitin Gadkari was given the full-time additional charge of this ministry, there seems to be a semblance of some work being done, DPRs prepared, projects pushed, and money flow controlled. Earlier last week, Gadkari, a minister known for expediting works and almost always meeting targets, however, admitted that there were delays, funds remained underutilised, new components were added. Overall, even when the work has been going on in right earnest everywhere, “I can now say with some confidence that the Ganga will be 70-80 per cent clean by March 2019,” Gadkari told the media as he presented a detailed report card ahead of the completion of four years of the NDA government. “It is a general perception that nothing significant is being done under Namami Gange Programme, but this is not correct. 251 Gross Polluting Industries (GPI) have been closed and closure directions have been issued to non-complying GPIs,” he said, and also added, “Real time monitoring of pollutions is being done in 938 industries. As many as 211 main ‘Nallas’ have been identified which are causing pollution in Ganga and 20 modular STPs are being deployed to treat Nalla water. Regular review meetings with all the states government officials, contractors, consultants are being done and obstacles regarding DPR’s, tendering process, finalisation of design, payment to contractors are being removed for speedy completion of projects.” From an almost pompous announcement of “we will clean the Ganga” to admitting that it will be only 70-80 per cent clean, this is a major climbdown for a government for which the countdown for the Lok Sabha polls has already begun. Not much seems to have been done till the end of financial year March 2018. “Work is going on full steam. It is just that we are practically re-assessing the goals,” an official said. The bigger problem, in fact, lies with what has not been done. “Namami Gange” is an integrated Ganga Conservation Mission, an umbrella programme with the aim to integrate previous, currently ongoing and new projects planned as part of the programme at an indicative cost of Rs 20,000 crore — a non-lapsable fund. The priority is on key activities such as pollution abatement, river front development, rural sanitation, biodiversity conservation, restoration of special properties of the Ganga, river flow improvement, Ganga Task Force, capacity building, GIS mapping and Ganga monitoring centres. Gadkari went on to detail the statistics, numbers and data and listed the whole range of works that have been done, are in the pipeline, proposed et al. But in the end, the promise is to have only 70-80 per cent of the Ganga cleaned. But more worrying is what he did not promise. Environmentalists have always maintained a very simple basic definition of a river — it needs to be “aviral”, a water body that flows continuously, and “nirmal”, one that is “clean”. Even when the government has rearranged its targets for cleaning the Ganga, the worst part is its refusal to concede how aviral and nirmal need to go together for any river. “Aviral has lot of aspects and needs to be studied further. Modiji has made it clear that cleaning the Ganga is our priority number one. Once we do it to a major extent, the issue of aviral will be discussed,” Gadkari told the media. Among the many issues raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), which had  the “Performance Audit of Rejuvenation of River Ganga”, a major section was dedicated to e-flow — the ecological flow of the Ganga. Pointing out how “aviral dhara or continuous flow is important for restoring the wholesomeness of the River Ganga”, the NGRBA notification (2009) had emphasised the urgent need “to maintain ecological flow in the River Ganga with the aim of ensuring water quality and environmentally sustainable development”. The CAG said “there is an urgent need to maintain ecological flow in the river Ganga with the aim of ensuring continuous flows throughout its length so as to restore its ecological integrity that enables it to self-rejuvenate”. Exactly what experts and environmental activists have always maintained — that a continuous flowing river is one that can cleanse itself. The CAG had further pointed out: “The NMCG did not identify places of discontinuity of water flow due to engineered diversion or storage and did not initiate any remedial action thereof. NMCG did not determine the magnitude of ecological-flow at different points for the River Ganga. It also did not assess the linkage between ecological flow and water quality. It was in the process of obtaining data on flow during different seasons, for the period 2015-17 from Central Water Commission. Thus, the NMCG has neither formulated the parameters for determination of ecological flow at different points nor identified the particular impediments affecting the flow.” A serious flaw but one that the government has put on the backburner. This leaves room for suspicion. Why is the government not keen on pursuing the goals of aviral and nirmal together? Is it because it still wants to construct dams upstream of Rishikesh in Uttarakhand? Or is it because the government is majorly promoting water highways which might need the construction of barrages downstream of Allahabad? There are no clear answers to these questions. What exactly is this government’s intention? Without the aviral dhara and nirmal dhara together, whatever else will be done will only be a mockery in the name of Namami Gange and Ganga cleaning. The Ganga is a perennial river fed by snowmelt and ice melt almost round the year. Ganga’s is the largest river basin in India, constituting 26 per cent of the country's land mass and supporting about 43 per cent of its population. The basin covers an area of 10,86,000sqkm, extending over India, Nepal and Bangladesh. About 79 per cent area of the Ganga basin, spread over 8,62,769sqkm, is in India. The river flows through five states — Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal – of India before it drains into the Bay of Bengal.",2018-05-15,"National mission for clean ganga,Ganga,Clean ganga,Namami Gange",Mockery of Modi vowing he'll have River Ganga cleaned up 4 years ago,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/namami-gange-save-ganga-nitin-gadkari-water-resources-ministry/story/1/24170.html
390,TS Sudhir,"The Congress is now officially PPP - Punjab, Puducherry, Parivaar. This acronym was coined by Narendra Modi on the campaign trail in Karnataka. With Bangalore gone, the Congress has shrunk further on the political map of India. How did the BJP manage such a big win when many backed chief minister Siddaramaiah to win despite anti-incumbency of five years? Here is what I think are the 10 reasons why Karnataka chose to colour itself saffron. During the last minute blitzkrieg from May 1 by Modi during which he addressed 21 public meetings and spoke to different groups via Namo App, the Congress team admitted to me it was losing momentum and it urgently needs to course correct. The course correction never happened in the face of three-four meetings that Modi addressed every day. The Congress that through March and April was seen as setting the agenda, was reduced to only rebutting and fact-checking Modispeak. On the ground, the cadre was enthused and the voters bought into his vision of Congress-mukt Karnataka. A lot was made of BS Yeddyurappa's leadership, the fact that he had gone to prison in a corruption case that forced him to step down as CM in 2011. The people of Karnataka took a leaf out of Tamil Nadu's book. Just like the neighbouring state brought back Jaya in 2016 despite her jail stint in the disproportionate assets case, it brought back BSY today (May 15). It showed corruption as a card cannot be overused. Like Jaya had been punished in 1996 for the same case electorally, Yeddyurappa had met his Waterloo along with the BJP in 2013 for providing a corrupt government, the people were willing to give him a second chance. The aggressive push by the RSS mattered immensely on the ground. In constituencies all over Karnataka, especially in coastal and central Karnataka, the Sangh Parivar campaigned door-to-door, spending time with the families, asking them to vote for a Hindu party. The results show the Hindus for Hindus card worked. The BJP had close to 20,000 WhatsApp groups in Karnataka which it used aggressively to get its political messaging across to the voters. Though the Congress claimed it had 16,000 groups, the kind of content it shared on the groups was no match for the BJP. While the Congress stole a march on the more urban medium of Twitter, the smartphone penetration ensured every voter was the recipient of BJP's virtual outreach. The feeling in the last five years that he was anti-Vokkaliga and anti-Dalit, having marginalised senior leaders belonging to both communities proved to be his undoing. There was a feeling that his government was dominated by the AHINDA (Muslims, Dalits, backward classes) and the results in Old Mysuru region where it expected to do well, suggest there has been a reverse consolidation against this. Siddaramaiah expected the Lingayat card to work for the Congress to an extent, at least take away 8 to 10 per cent of the Lingayat votes away from the BJP. In 2013, the 9.8 per cent Lingayat vote shift to Yeddyurappa's Karnataka Janata Paksha had brought about the BJP's downfall. The results from northern Karnataka show the ploy did not quite work and the BJP's charge that Siddaramaiah was dividing Hindu community gained currency. The BJP had virtually outsourced three districts - Bellary, Chitradurga and Raichur to B Sriramulu and Gali Janardhan Reddy. Though Reddy was kept at arm's length by Amit Shah and Modi, on the ground, he was unofficially in-charge of ensuring the BJP succeeds in central Karnataka. The Congress made Yeddy + Reddys an issue and hoped the rest of Karnataka would show its disgust to the homecoming of Reddy. That did not quite happen. Shah worked hard to ensure back channel talks with the mutts, especially Lingayat and Dalit seers, to solicit their support for the BJP. The party was determined not to let the Lingayat vote move away from it. The Congress fought this election like a regional outfit, highlighting the Kannadiga regional identity, flag, and language aggressively. None of it seemed to have worked at the hustings, with the people choosing to invest in a national identity. The Congress renominated most of its sitting MLAs, without realising that several of them faced severe anti-incumbency. The argument given then was that if they were not given tickets, they would either defect or stand as independents and spoil the chances of the official Congress candidate. The results show that like many times before, the Congress messed up on this critical part. Before Karnataka election, Modi's critics would gloat calling the south of the Vindhyas, BJP-mukt Dakshin Bharat. Siddaramaiah himself went to town talking about a north-south divide. The election result has busted both claims.",2018-05-15,"Narendra Modi,Siddaramaiah,Assembly election,Karnataka elections",10 reasons why BJP crushed Congress and took a massive lead in Karnataka,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-elections-siddaramaiah-bjp-congress-yeddyurappa-narendra-modi-karnataka-election-result/story/1/24142.html
391,Vishnu Sharma,"Indian  has once again stirred the political pot in the Himalayan nation. The Left alliance of the Communist Party of Nepal (UML) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist-Centre) — which was going strong just a while ago, is now on shaky ground and almost in tatters. Also, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is no more the unwavering ""nationalist"" he was being hailed as before the Modi avalanche hit the Himalayas. Hardly hours after Modi left Nepal, Oli was uncharacteristically apologetic. Addressing Parliament on   accepted his government’s weaknesses in handling the visit. Even though he reiterated that the relationship between the two nations cannot remain strained forever, he nevertheless “praised the patriotic people of Nepal” for “keeping tabs on the government and its lapse so that such things don’t repeat again and past mistakes are corrected”. He added that he had ""taken the concerns of media and intellectuals very seriously"".  Speaking in Parliament,  evoked  , scheduled in June this year, as an example of how nations must mend ties, but he certainly was concerned about the dent in his ""nationalist"" image and the anger the visit had generated in Kathmandu. The Oli-led UML and Prachanda's Maoist-Centre fought the elections together with the promise of merging the two parties and forming a single communist bloc in Nepal. The election promise is still unfulfilled and, post Modi's visit, looks doubtful. The long and uncertain wait for the merger has frustrated the supporters and workers of the parties and various morchas. On the occasion of Communist Party’s formation day, April 22, which also happens to be the birth anniversary of Lenin, the two sides were caught in skirmishes and raised slogans against each other. The Maoist-Centre supporters accused the UML workers of showing arrogance by not putting Lenin’s picture on the podium. They were also unhappy that Prachanda was not welcomed with equally distinctive words as was used for KP Oli. The programme began only after the organisers hung an image of Lenin along with KP Oli’s picture and Prachanda was introduced elaborately. Since the elections, both Oli and Prachanda have been telling their supporters that the unification is just a matter of time. Firstly, it was due before Oli’s India visit. Then there were news that the merger would happen before PM Modi's return visit. A month ago, Oli and Prachanda had signed a seven-point unity agreement and formed a team of top leaders to resolve the issues related with the merger. But since then the enthusiasm has evaporated and the merger, as one Maoist central committee leader told in confidence, is a non-agenda, that is, they have even stopped discussing it in the meetings.  As soon as Modi landed in Nepal’s Janakpur, the cracks between the two parties began to show. While Prachanda kept a low profile throughout Modi’s stay, his ministers too gave a miss to all state programmes. Nepal’s minister of energy, Barshaman Pun, did not attend the inauguration of hydropower project Arun III. His associate complained that he was not invited. Later the Maoists leaders boycotted the civil reception given to Modi in Kathmandu. It is learnt that Oli is cancelling the political appointments made in recommendation by the coalition partner Maoist Centre. He has even started to ignore suggestions offered to him by Prachanda. By now it is almost clear that the UML’s top leadership is not very sure about Prachanda’s leadership. Ever since the UML was formed in the 1990s, it seen Prachanda and his party as rivals. Even during the People’s War day, the Maoist cadres had often attacked the UML leaders and workers in places of their influence. Curiously, even today UML’s website has a link to the names of 490 of its cadres killed by the Maoist-Centre activists. The page reads: ""The number of victims of the conflict is several times higher than the workers killed during the party’s struggle against the Rana regime, Panchayat system or the monarchy.""   Similarly, the Maoist leaders too are increasingly becoming weary about the merger. The way the leaders are being sidelined is seen as a warning for future. According to the central committee leader, mentioned earlier, that the youth wing of the party - Young Communist League - and most of the intellectuals and the foreign department of the party are against the unity. However he says, at the end, Prachanda will have the last say in the matter. It is not clear yet what is in Prachanda’s mind, but it seems he is ready to give some more time to his comrade Oli to put his house in order. Oli and Prachanda are ambitious and both need each other. But both of them should also keep in mind that the delay in unity is not taking them anywhere. If the merger isn’t hastened, it will only accelerate the split. And the takeaway for Oli is, national chauvinism, red or saffron, is like the djinn of the Arabian Nights, easy to evoke, difficult to control. ",2018-05-15,"Foreign policy,India,Modi,Nepal",How Modi visit left Nepal's politics in a massive mess,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/nepal-modi-visit-india-communal-foreign-police-divisive-figurehead-kp-oli-prachanda/story/1/24139.html
392,Claude Arpi,"After focusing for years on Lhasa and southern Tibet, Beijing has decided to invest in the development of western Tibet, known as the Ngari Prefecture of the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR). Despite the 2015 Nepal earthquake which delayed the building of infrastructure in the area, particularly the railway line Lhasa-Kyirong at the Nepal border, the work has now started at an accelerated pace. One project which could have serious strategic implications for India is the extension of the National Highway G216 from Xinjiang to Kyirong landport; linking Xinjiang to south Asia seems to be a new dream for the leadership in Beijing. Though technically it is a formidable challenge to cross the Kunlun range, the Chinese engineers are determined to implement the scheme. This could also have immense economic consequences as it may become the main conduit of a new Silk Road from Central Asia to Nepal and South Asia. Has India been taken into the loop when Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""informally"" met the Chinese president recently? It is doubtful. Meanwhile, western Tibet develops fast. In January, VTIBET.com reported that the Ngari prefecture received over 6,60,000 visitors in 2017. The statistics released by the Ngari Tourism Bureau website said that it was a 20 per cent growth compared to the previous year. Even the revenue increased. “The tourism revenue totalled about 750 million yuan, up by 10 per cent over the same period last year.” The website cites the prefecture’s marvels: the Kailash Manasarovar area, the ruins of the former Guge Kingdom and the Tholing Clay Forest — all located in Ngari Prefecture. Last month, Radio Free Asia (RFA) announced that the Chinese authorities have seized farmland in Lhatse to build a new airport, “displacing Tibetan villagers and offering far less in compensation than the land is worth”. RFA argued that the land belonged to Yushang village in Shigatse prefecture’s Lhatse county. Apart from the deprivation of the land, the news item shows that in the years to come, Western Tibet could become the new economic and touristic hub and, of course, an important strategic centre for the defence of China’s borders. The opening of a new airport should be seen in this perspective, though the rapidly increasing trade with Nepal shouldn’t be ignored. According to  , the total value of Tibet’s foreign trade exceeded 5.8 billion yuan (nearly Rs 6,700 crore) in 2017. “The domestic economy has been steadily improving, and the demand for international market has generally recovered,” noted the daily. Nepal is the main recipient of Tibet’s exports. In April, Nepal’s foreign minister, Pradeep Gyawali, visited Beijing. After meeting vice-president Wang Qishan and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, he spoke of “expediting past agreements, developing trans-Himalayan multidimensional transport network and building a China-Nepal-India economic corridor.” Gyawali noted that China is Nepal’s genuine friend and a trusted ally. “We should build on the excellent roots of civilisational, geographical and cultural affinities to further connect our countries and societies.” This new civilisational bond between China and Nepal explains the need of a new airport in Lhatse.  mentioned another megaproject, the ""extension"" of the G216 Highway which, according to the article, will end in Kyirong. What does the extension of G216 mean? In 2016, a ""Public Announcement for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of G216 (Tibet Area)"" was made. The original 857-km-long highway starts from Altay City in northern Xinjiang and ends in Baluntai (in Hejing County). It will now be extended via Minfeng and Keryia in southern Xinjiang to western Tibet and Nepal. Needless to mention the immense technical challenge to cross the Kunlun range between Keryia and Rutok where the road will join the G219 or Aksai Chin road. To give an idea, Keryia is located at 1,459m sea level, while Lake Lighten on the plateau is at 5080m (a 3,500m climb in less than 200km). It is perhaps the most difficult terrain in the world. The last section of the ""extended"" G216 (towards Nepal) will have a length of about 94km; the geological conditions are complex, said a Chinese website: “After experiencing the May 12, 2015 earthquake in Nepal, the geological conditions are even more unpredictable. The original roads at the Kyirong Port have been seriously damaged, and the subgrade has subsided in some sections.” The main bridge in this section is said to have collapsed “and the road surface was broken and cracked.” Kyirong is located 24km away from the Nepal border; it is now the main channel for land trade between China and the former kingdom. Due to the earthquake, the railway line between Shigatse and Kyirong has been delayed by at least three years. After the earthquake, one section of the G216 slipped and is no longer accessible. The road from Kyirong to the border with Nepal is only a dirt road. “When the rainy season arrives, disasters such as landslides and mudslides are frequent.” The point remains that if the terminal section of G216 towards Kyirong is difficult, it is nothing compared to the section which will try to cross the Kunlun range, north of Lake Lighten. One more crazy dream of the rulers in Beijing? Or a visionary project in view of the importance of having a second Xinjiang-Tibet highway (after the Aksai Chin road built in the early 1950s)? Could it be a true New Silk Road linking Central Asia to South Asia via Nepal? It is difficult to say today. The engineers have to cross the Kunlun first. India should watch the developments.

393,Rajeev Dhavan,"In a famous speech to the Constituent Assembly, BR Ambedkar asserted that the “individual” not the “group” was the basis of the Constitution. Of course, he was referring to “past” groups. Elections were to be based on “individual votes” (apart from some reservations for SC/ST and others). The Constitution did not mention “political parties”. That was understood in the English sense. It was later mentioned in the ""symbols"" order. Due recognition was given to political parties in the Anti Defection Amendment in 1985. It was expected that “candidates” (albeit linked to parties) would be selected on merit-performance. The Karnataka elections are the culmination of juggernaut politics in a way that crumbles sensitivities of the electoral process. It is true that crucial elections have always invited party leaders to canvass. One approach is to take party leaders to the marginal constituencies. The other is the blitzkrieg. Although Karnataka was preceded by UP, Gujarat and Bihar, the nature of elections has altered. Now every election (including a by-election) has the prestige of a general election — with each victory or loss as crucial. Elections are like an invasion to conquer. The BJP wants to invade strongholds by whatever means. Their strategy was first pointed towards the Northeast, which is separated from mainland India by a chicken’s neck at Siliguri. We know that the Northeast was partly won by guile (President’s Rule in Arunachal, Uttarakhand) and the use of governors where they were not the leading party (Goa, Manipur) — forcing electoral democracy to take a back seat. Karnataka represents the invasion of the South across the Vindhya mountains into different realms separated by language, culture, beliefs and practice. What was involved in this invasion was establishing the BJP empire in the South, putting all their resources into it. Curiously, it was Aurangzeb’s (whom the BJP despise) dream to extend the Mughal Empire beyond the Vindhyas. In pursuing that dream the BJP wants the annihilation of the Congress party at every juncture. The battle was pitted at different battlegrounds. The entire forces of the BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his general Amit Shah. Joining the fray were eleven odd ministers at the centre. The rulers of Delhi seemed to abandon governance of the nation. It was during this period that Trump imposed sanctions on Iran, which will have a mighty effect on India’s oil and its strategic initiative for a port to access Central Asia. It is no excuse to say that government carries on because bureaucrats run it. Or that the PM was briefed. The only external affairs initiative of Modi was to engage Nepal and assure that a road would be built to connect Nepal’s religious sites with Ayodhya. Saffron-clad chief minister Adityanath of UP found himself in Karnataka when burning issues need attention in his state. Unconnected was the CM of Haryana questioning whether Muslims could pray in the open. In the Babri Masjid case (1994) the Supreme Court said Muslims don’t need a mosque. They can pray anywhere “even in the open”. The Lingayat issue surfaces because recognition was given to them by the incumbent government but it may backfire. Constitutionally, the demand for recognition as a separate faith should not be problematic because monolithic Hinduism’s claims over all beliefs other than Christians and Muslims is a hoax though supported by a doubtful judgment in the Swami Narayan case (1966). The Sangh Parivar wants to invite a diversion between Hindus and non-Hindus. This is its politics played out in the knowledge that pan-Hindus policies can be a trump card for them. Of course, the frontal face is sab ka sath, sab ka vikas. On its part, Congress took on the challenge to field Rahul Gandhi. The exchanges between the parties were asinine playing on vituperations: Rahul is namdar (derived from his name) or Modi is kamdar (a work based pedigree). Rahul erred in his off-the-cuff statement that he is a possible prime Minister after 2019. But this adds fuel to the fire of juggernaut elections. The fact that the Reddy brothers were with the BJP that was drowned in the rhetoric of exchange. Many young members of the electorate did not know who the chief minister of the state was as they were sucked into personality-based politics. Yet the Yeddyurappa versus Siddaramaiah battle was eclipsed by the New Delhi leadership. Social media targeting has and will play a role. Cambridge Analytica may have gone but its equivalents are very much alive. Ultimately, it’s down to the voter and the constituency system. In America, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a million but lost because of America’s electoral system. In India, the aggregate popular vote is eclipsed by constituency results. Psephologists, unable to gauge ground realities suggest that anti-incumbency is a lesser factor. A hung Assembly is not beyond prediction. Even Amit Shah reduced his expectation from 150 to 130 seats (still above 122). But it is precisely in a hung Assembly that the BJP-appointed governor will play a crucial role. Whether JD(S) will dethrone Congress’ candidate Siddaramaiah for a price will depend on machinations — the ultimate decision maker. Juggernaut politics has come to stay and will reflect in forthcoming elections this year in MP, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan as a prelude to the general elections of 2019. Indian democracy is usurped by showmanship and the possibilities of electoral fascism. Karnataka is its grave turning point in the new millennia.

394,Atul K Thakur,"KP Sharma Oli, Nepal's prime minister, is a politician gifted to represent the contradictions. Before he secured absolute majority and let the insecure comrades-in-arms, including formidable Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai join an unusual left unity, he was not someone who believed in Nepal's ethnic diversities and the rights of Madhesis, Tharus, Janjatis and women. Oli had represented the old world view of Kathmandu's ruling elite, unevenly dominated through the stronghold of hilly Arya-Khas community. But in the changed times, with the provision of provincial governments in Madhesh and extraordinary attention on his over-sized promises, Oli is now more receptive to broader ideas than ever before. Living the same positive spirit, he visited India immediately after taking charge as a prime minister for a second term. Attempting course-correction, he also invited Narendra Modi to visit Janakpur, Muktinath (Mushtang) and Kathmandu — places vital for latter's ""cultural encircling policy"" and effectively creating a Ramayana Tourist Circuit around India-Nepal-Sri Lanka. Finally, Modi was allowed to do what Kathmandu had once resisted fearing it may rile an aggressive China. Noticeably,   didn't touch the base of China's One Belt One Road Initiative and skipped the complex issues of trilateralism. Also, on enhancing bilateral economic cooperation and for removing the idiosyncrasies in India's stalled energy and infrastructure projects, the visit proved to be a wasted opportunity. It's been ironical that the high-profile political visits and diplomatic engagements have not been helpful to the stalled hydroelectricity projects in which India has high stakes and is subject to growing criticism in Kathmandu's policy circle. Among a large number of Nepalis, India is no longer being seen as an ally that keeps its words and implements things on ground. This should concern PM Modi, as for him, Nepal is the most important zone where he has been trying hard to implement his plans. What was rather expected of Modi's visit was to get the long-pending issues of Kosi project and other joint energy projects on the table for discussion in order to find mutually agreeable solutions. In fact, a point-wise analysis of pending issues and solving them would have been appreaciated. In Janakpur, the culturally, historically and politically rich border town of Nepal, Modi received a rousing welcome from his counterpart Oli and the local government. Among the highlights of the visit were flagging of a Maitri Bus Service between Janakpur and Ayodhya and announcement of a grant of Rs 100 crore for Janakpur. A long-pending project, Raxaul-Kathmandu railway line project, was also tabled for discussions. A feasibility study on the project in likely to be completed this year. The response from the public to Modi's visit was, however, cautious. In hilly areas, Modi is still seen as the single-biggest reason behind the nine-month-long painful   that came in 2015. The people of Nepal also had to face unnecessary trouble because of the demonetisation plan. In Madhesh, a section of activists and people are deeply disappointed with the growing bonhomie between Modi and Oli. The Nepali prime minister is seen by many in his own country as being responsible for promulgating a divisive constitution. For now, Nepal's political fundamentals are stable and the government is committed to pursue the economic policies implemented by the previous governments and kings. The ruling regime in Kathmandu is not averse to experimenting on the foreign affairs front. On both counts, China will have a larger role to play. To maintain India's traditional edge in Nepal, Modi government should rely on the basics and let its external affairs ministry to do some crucial talking. As on any competitive and contested turf, uninformed and unpopular advisers will harm India's prospects further. Ideally,   should no longer be dealt through the emissaries and immature handlers of New Delhi-based think tanks. To move ahead, the Modi government will have to rely on proper channels. In recent years, the bilateral relations between India and Nepal have been through a roller coaster ride. Both countries should come to terms with that and ensure a stable framework for the times to come. While Nepal had opted for ""a balancing approach"" in dealing with Modi, India must base its reciprocation on firm grounds as it has to maintain its unique edge with its closest neighbour and silently compete with China that is no longer a lazy power of old times. India also has to ensure that Nepal shares New Delhi's concerns about its sovereignty. Kathmandu will come closer, if New Delhi will make enough room for Nepal - for availing its closeness with India and remaining distinct and different!",2018-05-13,"India-Nepal relations,KP Oli,Modi in Nepal,Narendra Modi",What India couldn't achieve during Modi's Nepal visit,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-india-nepal-relations-kp-oli-madhesi-hydroelectricity-project-prachanda-nepal/story/1/24109.html
395,Rajeev Sharma,"Pakistan's ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's admission that   in Mumbai needs to be viewed from different perspectives - his political compulsions, its diplomatic and political fallout for Pakistan, the unexpected diplomatic win for India and reactions within India, some really wild and   making a case for Indian invasion of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) and his advocacy for Indian help in liberation of Balochistan. First, consider Sharif's remarks in his interview to Pakistani daily  , which triggered an international diplomatic maelstrom: ""Militant organisations are active. Call them non-state actors. Should we allow them to cross the border and kill 150 people in Mumbai? Why can't we complete the trial?"" It's pertinent to note that the three-time prime minister has made this hugely embarrassing remark for his country at a time he is being hounded from all sides, particularly the judiciary, and neither the political establishment nor the powerful military has come to his help. In April, Pakistan Supreme Court disqualified him for life from holding any public office for failing to declare his assets while being the prime minister, a harsh measure which came just two months after the Pakistani apex court   of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). The February 2018 order of the Supreme Court ruled that all decisions taken by Sharif as the party chief stood ""null and void"". Sharif's condition is akin to a cat trapped inside a room with all exits sealed and stick-wielding people coming after the hapless animal. In such a situation the cat invariably pounces at the attacker's face to escape. Sharif too appears to have done that. Being a seasoned politician and three-time premier, Sharif cannot be unmindful of the consequences of his remarks for his country's image internationally. This may be part of Nawaz Sharif's conscious and deliberate strategy aimed at his domestic constituency. He is probably sending a signal to the political and military establishments to intervene and stop his ""persecution"" before it is too late. It remains to be seen if Sharif gets some substantive relief in the coming days as Pakistan is due to hold its next general election later this year. If no such thing happens, Sharif may further up the ante and come up with more embarrassing statements which name and shame Pakistan. Expectedly, Sharif's remarks have roiled the political waters within Pakistan. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chairperson Imran Khan pounced upon the opportunity and criticised Sharif for speaking against Pakistan's sovereignty, saying the ex-PM has joined hands with foreign forces for personal gains. Khan even   in lambasting Sharif and said Sharif was speaking the language of PM Modi to save the Rs 300 billion that he has concealed under the names of his sons' offshore companies. Incidentally, you can call it the Sharif impact as close on the heels of Sharif's remarks, Imran Khan was showered with rare praise from general Pervez Musharraf, who said Khan had a very good chance of being elected as the prime minister in the upcoming elections. Musharraf also said that Imran Khan was a much better choice in comparison to Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari to lead the nation. This may be indicative of things to come and confirms the widely held belief in Pakistan that Imran Khan is being propped up by the Pakistan Army. Actually, this is not the first time when former rulers of Pakistan have put their country in a fix with their controversial statements. Loose lips sink ships! Just about six months ago, former Pakistan president and army chief general Musharraf had said that he was the  , an internationally ostracised terror outfit which is banned even in Pakistan since 2002. He didn't stop at that and added that he was aware that the LeT liked him too. In an interview with Pakistan's Ary TV in November 2017, Musharraf had remarked thus about LeT's founder and mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks Hafiz Saeed: ""I'm the biggest supporter of Lashkar-e-Taiba and I know the LeT and JuD people like me… Yes, I have met him (Saeed), even recently…I have always been in favour of action in Kashmir, and I've always been in their favour, that in Kashmir we must pressure the Indian Army and this (LeT) is the biggest force."" Musharraf's remarks had come after Saeed, a United Nations-designated terrorist, was freed from house arrest on an order from Lahore high court. Obviously, Musharraf cannot be unaware of the fact that the United States too has branded Saeed a terrorist and put a $10 million bounty on his head after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. Sharif knows that erstwhile rulers of Pakistan like Musharraf have embarrassed Pakistan with their controversial remarks and gone scot-free. However, Sharif's remarks have triggered some hawkish response from within India. Sample this statement of yoga guru Ramdev in response to Sharif's confession: ""It is true that terrorists are trained in Pakistan, a solution to this problem is that India should invade PoK and make it a part of the country. India should also help in freedom of Balochistan, only then Pakistan will correct its course."" Political parties like BJP and Congress too waded into the controversy and lambasted Pakistan's involvement in aiding and abetting terrorism in India. Union minister for minority affairs, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi,  : ""Pakistan is solely responsible for 26/11 terrorist attack. We have already provided enough evidence of the same to them but they have always denied those facts and all the related reports. The entire world knows this reality that Pakistan is responsible for 26/11 terrorist attack in India. If Nawaz Sharif has finally accepted this fact then it is great news."" Another Union minister minister of state for home Hansraj Gangaram Ahir said Pakistan was solely responsible for the 26/11 attacks. Congress leader Rajiv Satav too blamed Pakistan for orchestrating the 26/11 attacks and demanded stern action from the Centre against the Pakistani government. Satav said: ""Former prime minister Manmohan Singh ji has already said that Pakistan is behind the Mumbai 26/11 attacks. He was very strict with the Pakistani government when he was the prime minister. This is a very serious matter now."" Nawaz Sharif's admission of Pakistan's hand behind the 26/11 Mumbai carnage will inevitably trigger further slide in Pakistan's credibility before the international community. It may also adversely impact Pakistan in several cases it is locked in with India before the International Court of Justice and other international platforms. It has given an unexpected bounty to India to expose Pakistan at international platforms. The Sharif bombshell has exploded weeks ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China in June which India and Pakistan would be participating in for the first time as full-fledged members. China would be more wary of Pakistan now.",2018-05-13,"Pervez Musharraf,Pakistan,Nawaz Sharif,Terror attack",Why Nawaz Sharif has admitted to Pakistan's role in 26/11 attack now,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mumbai-terror-attack-26-11-attack-nawaz-sharif-baba-ramdev-tehreek-e-insaf-imran-khan/story/1/24107.html
396,Dr Rini Ralte,"“How do people from the Northeast feel about life in Bangalore?” I was asked this question over the phone while I was at a police station, trying to help file an FIR for a molestation victim from the Northeast. That alone answers the above question.  in less than 12 hours. While most people living in the state may not be participating directly in the polls, there is a lot at stake for us, too. It's another matter that at the moment, for all parties in the state, it's all about "" "". They don't feel the need to make a special mention of the ""outsiders"" living here. Nevertheless, we have been watching the election closely. I came to Bangalore 27 years ago, but every year, hundreds from across the eight states of the Northeast come to Karnataka for employment and education. Around three lakh people from the Northeast live in Bangalore, while two lakh others are spread out in other cities of the state. And this, despite the  , when those from the region living here rushed back home following rumours of orchestrated violence against them. Though attacks on the NE people were reported from cities outside Karnataka too, it was mainly those living in Bangalore who left the state in panic. The police and the government (at the time, the BJP was in power in Karnataka and Jagadish Shettar, the chief minister) claimed that not all the attacks on the northeasterners were racially motivated. Well, we can't be certain that was indeed the case. Yet, six years on, every year, citizens from the Northeast come to Karnataka in search of a better life. Bangalore is a favourite when it comes to deciding the city of their dreams outside their homeland. For many of us, it's not just about jobs. Though unemployment is a major reason, there are other important concerns, such as poor governance, lethargic administration, human rights violations and sexual abuse by the armed forces back home, that force us to make this choice. These are the painful realities which northeasterners wish to leave behind when they step outside their homeland. For a northeasterner with no school education, life as a construction worker or an ATM security guard in Bangalore is any day less menacing than living in the fear of getting picked up by an Army van on the mere suspicion that he/she is a militant – and then never returning home. The same is the case for the educated, yet unemployed — it's better to serve in the hospitality sector, even at the lowest rung, than to succumb to frustration or drug abuse. For the student community in the Northeast, quality higher education of the kind offered outside the region is years away. Yet, while they leave their homes in the hope of better prospects and progress, they get beaten up, molested, raped and at times, even murdered in this state. Every month, I am inundated with calls from young men and women asking for help against  , aggressive neighbours and rapist employers. Not to mention the catcalls and jeers, which, unfortunately, are more than occasional. In Namma Bangalore, there are different names for a northeasterner — for the educated elite, we are the “migrant population” (decent enough); for the moneyed but uneducated, and flush with Kannadiga pride, we are the “tribal-chinkis”, sometimes also “Chinese” or a “kanchhi” (Nepali), the ""immoral"" outsiders. But that doesn't mean there have been no kind souls in Bangalore. There are many Kannadigas who have been working for our rights. Without their support, perhaps it would not have been possible at all for us to create public pressure on the police. The police are our only hope because the government says it cannot provide special cover only to NE people. They say if we give special attention to just one group, other ""outsiders"" too would start asserting their wants. “People from Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu or Maharashtra will say ‘what about us’?” Coming back to the elections, in which around 20,000-30,000 of the estimated five crore citizens will cast their ballot tomorrow, political parties, for obvious reasons, don't see much of a vote bank in us. Of course, the BJP got  all the way from Guwahati for campaigning — but he didn't meet representatives from all NE states, although a few Assamese friends told me that he had been talking about setting up “Assam House” in Bangalore should the BJP come to power. The small NE community in Bangalore obviously expects more from political leaders from its own region (irrespective of which party they belong to), especially from someone who is now seen as the most powerful BJP leader in the entire Northeast. But then, we also know that political leaders are bound to place the interest of their party over the people they represent. For that matter, it doesn't make much of a difference whether the Congress or the BJP wins this election. What we want is someone to hear us out, address our problems. And that is why voting or not, elections mean more to the ""outsiders"" living here than just the indigenous population. A change in government policies and programmes would also mean a change in the attitude towards the people from outside Karnataka living in the state. It's about our existence, our careers, our dignity and our dreams. We may not be a big vote bank, but then, numbers don't decide the actual success of a polity. People do. And every year, more people get added to this number in Karnataka. When I look back, it's slightly discouraging that despite spending 27 years in this city, and earning the goodwill of the local people, I remain an inside-outsider.

397,Kiran Tare,"Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was taken aback when Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray not only welcomed  , son of late BJP MP Chintaman Wanga, in the party fold but also fielded him in the poll fray in the by-election of Palghar Lok Sabha constituency, near Mumbai, on May 7. Angry Fadnavis blamed the Shiv Sena for  . “Shiv Sena has not done a good thing. They should have backed our candidate in Palghar,” he said. In Maharashtra, all major political parties have maintained a tradition of not to contest a by-election necessitated because of the death of a sitting member. Fadnavis reminded Thackeray that the BJP had not contested the Assembly byelection in Bandra as well as the municipal seat in Mumbai following the death of Shiv Sena members. He expected Thackeray to reciprocate the same after the demise of Wanga three months ago. However, under pressure from the cadre, Thackeray felt that it was the right opportunity to send out a signal that the Shiv Sena was firm on its stand of fighting elections alone by putting up a fight in Palghar. In an attempt to be politically correct, Fadnavis has claimed that BJP had unanimously decided to field Shrinivas in the poll fray before Shiv Sena hijacked him. He claimed that he had given an appointment to Shrinivas within five minutes of receiving a request for the same from him. “He was kept in an undisclosed place for five to six days so that we could not contact him,” Fadnavis said, pointing fingers at the Shiv Sena. The party sources, however, tell a different story. According to a senior leader, the BJP was not in a mood to field Shrinivas as he is not a public figure like his father. He points out that Shrinivas never interacted with the party leaders whenever they visited the Wangas’ home. “We could not say no to him because of the goodwill attached with his father. He got the wind of our intention of not giving him a ticket so he approached the Shiv Sena. It proved as a blessing in disguise for us,” the leader said. Fadnavis has indicated that he will take the by-election seriously. He managed to poach former Congress minister of state Rajendra Gavit to contest on a BJP ticket. “If we cannot win this by-election Wanga’s soul will not forgive us.

398,Mausami Singh,"The most difficult thing in any election is to read the voters' mind. It becomes all the more difficult when caste complexities and religious polarisation become the deciding factors. Kairana in UP is a classic example of such a mix of ideas, issues, politics and people. The run-up to Lok Sabha  has transformed Kairana into a political laboratory with stakeholders experimenting to find their formula for success in the 2019 elections. The Lok Sabha seat fell vacant following the death of BJP MP Hukum Singh, the man ""credited with"" the ""Hindu exodus"" that polarised voters in 2017 Assembly elections. The BJP has reposed faith in his daughter  who will be fighting Tabassum Hasan, fielded by the Rashtriya Lok Dal and backed by the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress. Tabassum, a former MP, is the wife of veteran SP leader Munawar Hasan. If Mriganka manages to win this by-election, it would also mean settling ""old scores"" with the Hasan family - Tabasum's son Nahid Hassan had defeated Mriganka in the 2017 Assembly elections. Obviously, the stakes are high as the BJP, pitted against a united Opposition, faces an uphill climb to reclaim its territory. So, on a scorching May afternoon, as BJP leaders gradually arrived at a small meeting ground in a congested market area in Shamli, desperation was writ large on their faces. One of them, taking the microphone, tried his best to whip up hysteria, but the crowd didn't seem too enthused. The stage was jam-packed with men in starched kurtas and a few women in sarees. A bunch of ministers, legislators and the state BJP chief sat together in a show of strength. After having burnt its fingers in the by-elections of Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the saffron party is treading with caution. Off the record, BJP leaders admit that the odds are heavily against them. With Yogi Adityanath in the state and Narendra Modi at the Centre, winning Kairana should ideally have been a cakewalk for the BJP, but for the demography of this constituency and the new Opposition alliance. Out of 17 lakh voters, almost five and half lakh are Muslims and about two lakh are Dalits, and a consolidation of the two for any candidate would mean an easy victory. The nationwide protests called by Dalit outfits on May 2 are an indicator of the simmering discontent and anger among the community. Many of them voted for Modi in 2014, but there is a growing sense of disappointment with the ruling BJP. In such a scenario, they only have Mayawati to look up to. With the latest alliance in place, the caste balance is heavily tilted in favour of the Opposition. To add to the Dalit and Muslim votes, the Jats have a strong emotional connect with Chaudhary Charan Singh's RLD. When combined, the Jats and other backward caste voters make up 11.5 lakh votes. There is an old saying in Uttar Pradesh that whichever party wins over the ""burqa and khurpa"" (a combination of Muslims, Dalits and OBCs) rules the state.  As BJP leaders addressed the small gathering of a few hundred people in Shamli, it was clear that the political discourse would invariably veer towards ""migration"" and ""ghar wapsi"". Controversial leader and state minister Suresh Rana, thundered: ""Who was Hukum Singh? He always stood for the welfare of his people, he was the person who raised the issue of migration in the beginning."" ""Ever since Yogi government has come to power the law and order situation has improved greatly."" ""Many have come back, people are calling to get their children admitted in school here."" Almost two years back, Hukum Singh had flashed a list of 346 Hindu families alleging that they had fled the district due to rampant lawlessness and fear. Various media reports though disputed the BJP's claims on "" "" after probe. Regardless of the facts, the BJP propaganda machine went into an overdrive to make it a poll issue. It is clear that the ruling party doesn't have enough issues to whip up a frenzy among voters. While voters are not ready to buy its promise of good governance, the party has faltered big time on the employment front as well. Since restoring law and order was one of its main poll plank during the 2017 Assembly election, BJP leaders have been flaunting a string of ""encounters"" as the government's no-tolerance policy against crime. This despite various reports accusing the BJP of misusing the UP police to create fear among people with fake encounters. In a constituency with a deeply divisive history, political parties and poll rhetoric hardly have any place for development and livelihood issues.    ",2018-05-12,"'hindu' exodus,Hukum singh,Uttar Pradesh,Kairana by-poll",Kairana by-poll: Why BJP is raking up 'Hindu exodus' stink to ask for votes,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kairana-by-poll-up-yogi-adityanath-hindu-exodus-hukum-singh-bjp-united-opposition-alliance-dalit-muslims/story/1/24076.html
399,Abhijit Iyer-Mitra,"The  . This is mostly good because it didn’t change much anyway, and like most things Barack Obama, was about substituting hope and marketing for cold hard policy. US President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the deal and re-imposition of sanctions isn’t all hunky-dory though. The process is long, complicated and will not be smooth sailing as the president has effectively thrown the ball back in Congress’ court: a Congress whose members are prone to posturing and peacockery, and who refused to assume responsibility for their support or opposition to the deal. From the US’ point of view, this timeframe provides sufficient scope to use Trump’s willingness to walk away from the deal to signal to North Korea that he’s a tough negotiator – as well as to sufficiently worry the Iranians to offer better terms. The question, of course, is why would the Iranians offer better terms, given that only one party – the US – has pulled out? But the interdependency of Europe with the United States means that no   entity can do business with Iran anymore. For example, Iran’s latest purchases of Airbus aircraft are dependent on engines produced in the US, and should the full spectrum of sanctions come into effect, even these brand new planes will be unserviceable. Similarly, most oil, infrastructure and finance companies have huge stakes in the US, and continuing business with Iran will automatically bring US sanctions upon their heads. In no cost-benefit analysis will any company or European nation choose Iran over the US. So, while Europe may symbolically throw a few cookies at Iran, there is little they can realistically do. The biggest political loser in this game, it seems, is  , who was convinced he had, through his intellect and charm, convinced Trump to keep the Iran deal intact. What is curious though is the actual losses are minimal. Iran’s entry or exit into the oil market was never a big deal immediately given that their extraction equipment is old and hasn’t been modernised, with their crude more suited to countries with similarly old refineries like India. As the last two years have shown, the massive cost of modernisation alone would mean that Iranian crude suffered from a monopsony market, and was therefore limited to whom it could sell to, sanctions or no sanctions. Similarly, years of sanctions meant a massive parallel economy had developed, mostly controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and other powerful individuals who comprise the deep state therein. The sudden lifting of sanctions challenged the monopoly they had built up over the decades and they were adamant about not letting independent Iranians encroach into this space. This is one of the reasons why, despite the removal of sanctions, Iran’s economy has been moving from one crisis to another with a massive drop in the value of its currency. As such, the demise of the deal is the best thing that happened to the deep state in Iran. This is also the best thing that could have happened to India. India’s refineries are uniquely suited to process Iranian crude and Iran can no longer play the “Oh, but I have other suitors waiting for me” game. It also means the negotiating advantage is now decisively with India and the barter agreement with Iran will have to be reinstated, which once again favours India. What was unique about the sanctions was that even if India paid Iran in cash, Iran’s negotiating position was so bad that it had to accept Indian offers at less than market cost, simply to generate enough cash to keep its economy running, with the losses having to be absorbed by the Iranian state. As such, even minimal compliance or non-compliance with new US sanctions causes damage to the Iranian state and enables India to keep both Iran and the US happy. Equally, it adds urgency to India’s Chahbahar connectivity programme, which India — if it plays its cards smartly — could use to supply US forces in Afghanistan with non-combat provisions, or at least sell it to the US. Even in West Asia, these sanctions will have little or no impact. Iran’s support for Hezbollah and the Syrian government will continue unabated. This was one of the main complaints of the detractors of the Iran deal, that terrorism-related sanctions had been lifted in lieu of nuclear compliance, in effect, giving Iran a “licence to terrorism”. Iran’s missile programme similarly had been continuing unabated: missiles that have absolutely no military value without a nuclear warhead. Supporters of the deal disingenuously and persistently avoided this question, repeatedly stating, “we are studying this problem’. So, where are we today?

400,Harsh V Pant,"Kidnapping of seven Indian engineers in Afghanistan along with their Afghan driver who worked for the Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat company that operates a power station in northern Baghlan has once again brought to the fore the worsening security situation in that country, but also how precarious Indian involvement in the nation is becoming. Though no group has claimed responsibility for these kidnappings, the local Afghan leadership has put the blame on the Taliban. The Afghan government has assured New Delhi that it would leave no stone unturned to protect and free the Indian engineers. Security situation in Afghanistan has been highly volatile in recent weeks. Just recently, more than 50 people died in a coordinated double suicide bombing in Kabul and a shooting in the eastern Khost province. Those killed included 10 journalists. The Taliban launched their 2018 spring offensive last week even as the Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for recent bombings, including attack on a voter registration centre, which killed 60 people. The Taliban and the ISIS are competing with each other and, in the process, the level of destruction and mayhem is reaching the extreme. While both the Taliban and the ISIS want to overthrow the US-backed Afghan government and impose strict Islamic rule, the Taliban’s focus has largely been government officials and security forces, even as the ISIS has been targeting civilians from Afghanistan’s Shia-Hazara minority, who it views as apostates. The Afghan state’s capacity is under siege and the insurgents are doing all they can to underscore its growing vulnerabilities. Regular attacks on government ministries and organisers of October’s parliamentary and district elections underscore the ability of the insurgents to take on the government forces at a time and place of their choosing. As it is, less than 60 per cent of Afghanistan is being controlled by the government forces, according to various estimates. As per the latest report of Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, the Afghan army and police together have 36,000 fewer personnel today than they did last year as a result of desertions and casualties. Recognising its limitations, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani made one last-ditch effort in February to restart the peace process by offering to recognise the Taliban as a legitimate political group. He suggested that he was willing to consider a ceasefire and a release of prisoners, including inclusive elections, and in return, the Taliban would have to recognise the Afghan government and respect the rule of law. But the Taliban have so far not considered it important enough. Instead they want direct talks with the US even as the Trump administration is struggling to come up with a coherent policy. US President Donald Trump’s heart is clearly not in the Afghan war, but his administration bought into the arguments of Gen John Nicholson, the US commander in Afghanistan, leading to a deployment of an additional 3,000 troops, taking the total of US forces in Afghanistan to about 14,000. The security situation on the ground, however, continues to be shaped by a logic of its own. Kidnaps in Afghanistan are not a new phenomenon. Last year, a Finnish aid worker was kidnapped from a Kabul guest house and released some months later. Before that in 2011, 12 Iranian and Afghan engineers were kidnapped while working on a road project in western Afghanistan. And Indians and Indian interests have been regular targets as well. As early as in 2003, two Indian engineers were abducted while assault on Indian outposts has continued unabated. The Indian consulate in Kabul was attacked in 2008 by a suicide bomber, resulting in the loss of lives of 55 people and wounding hundreds. This was followed by another attack on the Indian Embassy a year later and then, in 2010, a guest house frequented by Indians was targeted, killing several doctors. There more than 150 Indian engineers and technical experts working in Afghanistan on major infrastructure projects and their protection has been a matter of concern for New Delhi. Yet India’s engagement with Kabul has remained robust despite these challenges. Last year, India and Afghanistan inaugurated two air-corridors to boost connectivity and it has resulted in significant increase trade volumes. As part of a next-generation “New Development Partnership”, India is now implementing 116 new “high impact” development projects in 31 provinces of Afghanistan. India has given four military helicopters to Afghanistan and is imparting training to Afghan security personnel. It remains open to extending further assistance to bolster the armed forces of Afghanistan, though overall New Delhi’s approach on military matters remains one of caution. India’s engagement in Afghanistan is crucial for the Afghan state’s long-term viability and India has done well to continue its engagement despite facing the wrath of its adversaries. But, New Delhi will also have to figure out a way of protecting its nationals and other assets at a time when the Afghan security situation is getting worse by the day. The challenges for India are only going to grow and New Delhi cannot forever continue to rely on the benevolence of others.

401,Rajdeep Sardesai,"Ten days in Karnataka over two extended trips still leaves you with the stamp of an ""election tourist"" but then that is my professional hazard, so here are my 10 takeaways of an election that could still end up confounding every pundit and pollster. No two state elections are ever the same but in Karnataka, we have several elections taking place within the same state. As you travel from north to south, as I did, you are stunned by how quickly issues change as does the wondrous landscape. If water scarcity and the Mahadeyi river water sharing is a major issue in the Mumbai-Karnataka region of the north, then a distinct communal polarisation can be seen in the coastal belt. While south Karnataka farmers along the Cauvery basin still agonisingly recall two years of consecutive drought even while in Bengaluru, familiar cribs over crumbling infrastructure echo across middle-class colonies. Regional splits, income divides, rural urban fault-lines, Karnataka is a state lacking a pan-Karnataka narrative. The one factor that unites Karnataka is caste. The Hindi heartland can take some satisfaction that it isn't just north India where caste arithmetic counts, the caste equations are just as embedded in the Kannadiga psyche. If the Vokkaliga Lingayat dominant caste equation has been a constant narrative in recent elections, this time it is the backward caste, Dalit, Muslim social engineering (AHINDA) strategy of chief minister Siddaramaiah that has created ripples. The priestly Veershaiva Lingayat versus ""other"" Lingayats, ""left"" versus ""right"" Dalits, Karnataka is trapped in a maze of caste identities. Dalits in particular hold the key in 2018: If there is a wider Dalit consolidation, then it could change political equations. Karnataka's politics has seen a unique alignment of caste and community with cash and crime. The wealthy and powerful mutts (or religious seminaries) have their pockets of influence so do the even more cash rich politicians with their criminal records. While the media attention has been on the Reddy brothers - the mining barons of Bellary - the truth is that crime and corruption are great political equalisers in Karnataka. 
 
 If the BJP has the Reddys, the Congress too has its fair share of netas who have been on the wrong side of the law. Corruption in Karnataka is perhaps more ""de-centralised"": Almost every MLAs assets have dramatically increased when in power. (I did encounter an exception though: A Mangalore based MLA JL Lobo, a retired government servant, who actually appears a role model of financial integrity). And yes, most of the ""criminal"" netas are expected to win easily. There was a time when state politics were fought by all powerful regional ""bosses"". Indira Gandhi's imperious ""high command"" culture in the 1970s destroyed the idea of ""independent"" chief ministers in national parties, paving the way for the rise of regional party assertion. Ironically, one of those Congress chief ministers harshly dealt with by Mrs Gandhi was Karnataka's original backward caste hero Devraj Urs. Now, Siddaramaiah is attempting an Urs 2.0 brand of backward caste assertion and virtually running this election on his own pro-poor image. This is a rooted politician who has come up from taluka-level battles: He is on first name basis with virtually every sarpanch he meets. Politics for him is a ""take no prisoners"" style ""kushti"": from waving the flag of Kannadiga sub nationalism to dividing castes to a slew of freebie schemes, Siddaramaiah has been a neta on steroids in the last 18 months. Win or lose, he has provided a template for the revival of netas who seek to break away from the Delhi durbar. Speaking in English does him disservice. Listen to him in Kannada and you realise how disconnected the English-speaking elite are from ""real"" India. And yes, if he does win, he owes a debt not to Basavanna, the Lingayat icon, but to NTR and MGR/Jayalalithaa, towering southern India politicians who realised early enough that cheap food for the poor is a route to power, this could well be the ""Anna bhagya"" or cheap rice election. Well, yes and no. If Siddaramiah is almost a local folk hero, Yeddyurappa too once was an iconic figure, especially for the Lingayats. The past tense is necessary. The BJP leader has seen better days. At 75, he is tiring and the years of being accused of corruption and even going to jail have taken their toll. He seems like a leader on the edge and flares up easily on the campaign trail, perhaps acutely aware that this is his last chance to return to power. The BJP may have erred in projecting him as their chief ministerial candidate so early - he loses out in the popularity stakes to Siddaramaiah - but the party may have had little choice. BSY is still the BJP's tallest state leader, the Lingayats are still the core of the BJP's vote base, and the Gen-next leadership of the BJP just hasn't taken the next step yet to be seen as credible alternatives. Is there a retirement age for politicians? Well, not if you are Deve Gowda. The former prime minister will turn 85 this month but that hasn't stopped him from criss-crossing the Vokkaliga heartland of the old Mysore region. He travels only by car because he says choppers make him feel distant from his people. He tells me it is his spartan food habits that keep him going; I rather think it is the hope that his party could be kingmaker, if not king once again, that is driving him. There is nothing ""secular"" or idealistic about the Janata Dal Secular. It is now a single caste, single family business enterprise that still has an unshaken base of Vokkaliga shareholders in one corner of the state. The rumours that he is in a secret understanding with the BJP could damage the crucial ""plus"" vote of the JDS amongst Muslims and lead to a decline in seats. What will Gowda do on May 15? Only Gowda and sons have an answer. My sense is he will prefer anyone who makes his son the chief minister, even if for a short duration: ""putra-moh"" remains an Indian ailment. Yes, the BJP is primarily a party of north and west India, a party locked into a Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan worldview. But as the victory in Tripura showed, this is a party in expansionist mode that can adjust to any challenge. Crossing the Vindhyas has been a bridge too far in the past, but in Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the BJP have a duo whose ambition is boundless. Backed by a well organised and committed RSS cadre, this is independent India's most effective and ruthless election machine. 
 
 If the BJP wins in Karnataka, huge credit will go to the manner in which the party under Shah has worked yet again at astute and rigorous booth level management; if it loses, it will be back in five years, to try again even harder. In Modi, the party has a leader who has become a cult figure, a feel-good guru rolled into a political demagogue, who can instantly connect with his audiences. There doesn't seem to be a Modi ""wave"" outside of pockets of urban Karnataka - the emotional bond you see in a UP or a Gujarat is missing in the rural heartland here - but he is still by some distance the most popular national leader, especially among the young and the more urbanised audiences. In a Lok Sabha election in Karnataka, Modi's appeal would give the BJP a distinct edge; in a Vidhan Sabha election where local factors are more pronounced, Modi's ability to get the BJP to punch above its weight and rise above caste and sub regional divides is more uncertain. In school, there are marks given for effort and those given for general proficiency. For sheer effort, Rahul Gandhi deserves the highest marks in Karnataka. He pitched his tent here as early as February with his Jan Aashirwad yatra. He may still not be a natural instinctive politician and, at times, it almost appears as if he is trying too hard (his ""mutt-hopping"" in Karnataka example makes him look like an imitative neta). His public speaking skills have improved but will never match up to Mr Modi's histrionics. A presidential-style contest with Mr Modi in a multimedia age would be a walkover but at least he is now slowly carving out an image as a leader who is willing to listen to voices other than his own. His best work in Karnataka has been outside the campaign trail - giving Siddaramaiah a relatively free hand in ticket allocation and managing factions within the state Congress. He now needs to find a narrative that appeals to a young, aspirational India that seeks merit above lineage. Is this the best Karnataka has to offer? Travelling across this beautiful state, it seems as if the election fever has been more in the media and TV studios than on the ground. No politician or party truly enthuses the Karnataka electorate nor is there visible anti-incumbency anger. There is a status quoist nature to the political choices on offer, leaders who have been tried and tested and, mostly failed. ""We are a so-so state in politics"" is how one voter in Hubli aptly put it. If the Royal Challengers Bangalore has suffered because of an embarrassment of riches, the Karnataka political league is marked with a bankruptcy of talent. If the state is still marching forward, it is because its civil society remains energetic and progressive. Politics in states like Karnataka is a backward sector and will remain so for a while unless the cash driven political economy of elections changes. The general view is Karnataka is a ""too close to call"" election, one that is likely to throw up a hung Assembly in an age of clear verdicts (I am told resorts are already being booked for potential ""deal making"" post elections). As an old Karnataka hand tells me: Congress will not go below 80, the BJP will not be below 65, the JDS will not be below 30, the balance 50 marginal seats will decide the eventual power play. My own sense is that one of the two national parties will be close to a majority. If the Congress has a slight edge, it is simply because it has a wider social base and a more trusted local face. The BJP, realistically, is in the fight in about 170 seats and needs a high strike rate to get a majority. The Congress needs Deve Gowda's vote share to decline and the backward caste coalition to stay intact. Turnout holds the key. If the BJP can succeed in its last mile push to get its supporters to come out in large numbers, then it remains in with a chance. But it's the poor and lower income groups, rural and urban, who usually brave the summer heat to cast their vote who may well decide the final verdict. One last thing: we haven't had a ""super over"" in the IPL this year; maybe Karnataka with all its political twists and turns will provide us with one!

402,Anand Kochukudy,"At an outreach programme organised for prominent citizens in Bangalore today (May 8), Congress president  stated that he was ready to be prime minister, if Congress were to emerge as the largest opposition party in 2019 general elections. As this comes in the last leg of the Karnataka Assembly election campaiging, it might act as a morale boost for party workers who have waited patiently for the reluctant politician in Gandhi to take centre stage. It was less than a year ago -  - Gandhi declared that he was “absolutely ready” to be the prime ministerial candidate for the general elections. It came in the run-up to the Gujarat elections and was a prelude to his taking over the party’s reins from his mother Sonia Gandhi. While it’s one thing to be the prime ministerial candidate of the Congress, it’s an entirely different proposition to emerge as an acceptable choice for ambitious regional satraps who smell an opportunity to grab the PM's chair in 2019 based on various permutations and combinations. Needless to say, it will also depends on the outcome of the Karnataka Assembly polls, which is just four days away. Although Gandhi may not get much credit - as it happened with Punjab - if Congress comes back to power under Siddaramaiah, his prospects for emerging as the challenger to Modi will get further diminished if BJP were to form the government. It is the Congress’s marginalisation across the country that has given confidence to many regional leaders to become claimants to the top job in 2019. Ahead of the results in 2014, this writer remembers the BJP spokespersons’ jibes against Congress for not touching the triple digit-mark. Even the BJP hadn’t anticipated the Congress ending up with a tally of 44 and being left without a leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. While many people expected the grand old party to take corrective measures to prevent further slide, Rahul Gandhi took his own sweet time to finally come to terms with the losses and claim his party’s top position. Meanwhile, the Congress lost power in one state after the other, with Punjab being the only silver lining. In the past couple of months, there has been a lot of chatter about the likelihood of a ""third front"" or a grouping of regional parties calling the shots after the next elections. Apart from West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who camped for four days in New Delhi in March to talk to other opposition leaders, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao too has been flirting with the idea of a regional non-Congress/non-BJP front. These regional outfits expect a repeat of 1996, when no party or front could claim victory, and thrusted the unheralded HD Deve Gowda to the PM post. In fact, the general election of 1996 was an inflection point in many ways. RSS offshoot, the BJP, formed its first 13-day government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee - before he resigned on account of lack of numbers. In the ensuing commotion, the CPI (M) prevented Jyoti Basu from becoming the PM, and Janata Dal’s VP Singh’s name got vetoed by the Congress, finally leading to then Karnataka CM Deve Gowda emerging as the surprise pick. Deve Gowda’s biggest achievement as prime minister was that he was successful in giving hope to regional satraps across the country to aspire for the PM's chair. His defence minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, the then Janata Dal president Lalu Prasad Yadav and a host of others expressed their desire at various times to be the prime Minister after Gowda. Until 1996, despite short-lived governments under Charan Singh and Chadrashekhar as precedents, none of the regional leaders had the audacity to aspire for the top job. Coming back to Rahul Gandhi, what makes it tough for him to emerge as a consensus candidate-regardless of a positive result in Karnataka - is the fact that he hasn’t yet delivered an election victory on his own for his party. Although Congressmen would typically jostle to credit him with victory even in by-polls, his inability to win in Gujarat has been a huge setback to Gandhi’s candidature getting acceptance from allies. A victory in Gujarat - without a local face - would have propelled him to emerge as the natural challenger to Prime Minister Modi. But that wasn’t to be. Now, in all likelihood, it will be a ""Modi versus the rest"" scenario. Despite the ambitions harboured by the regional chieftains, there is a huge difference between 2019 and the scenario in 1996. Back then, the Congress lost power after a full term and there was no way it could claim to lead the government in a coalition set-up. So, they chose to support from outside the regional outfits led by Janata Dal - to keep the BJP out of power. Therefore, despite the burgeoning ambitions of Mamata Banerjee and K Chandrasekhar Rao, all of them might have to play second fiddle in the post-poll scenario, if Congress can at least garner more than 100 seats (which they should). Even a considerably weakened Congress is poised to make big returns in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states across the cowbelt, if recent by-elections are any indicator. But for the Opposition parties to dethrone Modi, they will need some unity in the pre-poll stage to avoid the splitting of votes and making it into an even fight. The Congress, as well as the regional parties, will have to accommodate each other and make some sacrifices to make it a reality. The decisive alliance in Uttar Pradesh between the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party,   is a good omen. But whether it be scaled up to the national level - with Congress as a glue - is for us to wait and watch.  ",2018-05-08,"Modi,2019 Lok Sabha polls,Prime Minister,Rahul Gandhi",Why Rahul Gandhi ready to be PM is not good enough to unite Opposition,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rahul-gandhi-ready-to-be-prime-minister-2019-lok-sabha-polls-modi-united-opposition-bjp/story/1/23986.html
403,Ashok Upadhyay,"Every time there's an election in India, Pakistan becomes BJP's ""go-to"" country. Or so it seems. BJP president Amit Shah once again tried to drag Pakistan into its poll debate, this time in Karnataka, referring to a tweet by Islamabad that praised Tipu Sultan. 
 
 Of course, this is not the first time that Shah and his party have a problem with Pakistan, Congress or Tipu Sultan. Over the past few years, the BJP has dubbed Tipu Sultan as ""anti-Hindu"" and has condemned Karnataka’s Siddaramaiah on a number of occasions for celebrating the birth anniversary of the former ruler of Mysore. Last week, the Pakistan government had praised Tipu Sultan while remembering him on his death anniversary. The Pakistan government’s official Twitter handle wrote, ""Revisiting an important and influential historical figure, the Tiger of Mysore - Tipu Sultan on his death anniversary. Right from his early years, he was trained in the art of warfare and had a fascination for learning."" Countering Shah's tweet, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said: ""There should be clapping for the uncanny timing. Wonder how Pakistan woke up in the middle of the Karnataka election to tweet about Tipu Sultan. This is a deliberately created coincidence."" The big question here is: Who drags Pakistan or makes it a party to Indian elections? Is it the Congress, as Amit Shah alleges, or is it the BJP itself?  On December 10, 2017, during a poll campaign in Gujarat’s Palanpur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that Congress leaders had held a secret meeting with important people from Pakistan before Mani Shankar Aiyar called him a ""neech"" person. Modi  , ""You people must have read the newspaper about the incident at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house. It was an issue of hot debate in newspapers and media yesterday that a meeting between former Pakistan high commissioner, former minister of external affairs of Pakistan, former vice president Hamid Ansari and former PM Manmohan Singh was held at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house. The meeting had run for three hours and the next day he called me 'neech' (lowly).""   He went on to add: ""This is an issue of serious concern that when Pakistan has become a sensitive issue for the country then what was the reason to hold a secret meeting with Pakistan when the polls are being held in Gujarat. Former director general of Pakistan army Arshad Rafiq has insisted that Ahmed Patel should be made CM of Gujarat. ""Former Pakistan army director general intervened in Gujarat election. They held meeting with Pakistanis at Mani Shankar's house and the very next day, the backward community of Gujarat, Modi and poor people of Gujarat were insulted. ""Is it not an issue of concern for the country? The Congress must answer what suspicious activities they are doing. They must answer the country."" So, it was Modi who dragged Pakistan saying it was conspiring with the Congress party to defeat the BJP. Fingers were pointed at former prime minister Manmohan Singh along with former vice-president Hamid Ansari. Seventeen days later, the BJP didn't exactly apologise, but it said that PM Modi didn't mean to question Manmohan Singh's commitment to India. Union minister Arun Jaitley said, ""The PM in his speeches didn't question, nor meant to question the commitment to this nation of either former PM Manmohan Singh or former VP Hamid Ansari, any such perception is erroneous, we hold these leaders in high esteem, as well as their commitment to India."" This clearly was a volte face for the BJP because what Prime Miniser Narendra Modi said wasn’t true. In 2017, during his campaign in Uttar Pradesh, Prime Minister Modi made similar anti-Pakistan statements. Addressing an election rally in Gonda district, the Prime Minister  : “The derailment of the Indore-Patna Express on November 20 last year was a conspiracy and conspirators carried it out sitting across the border... Gonda is adjoining Nepal."" He further said: ""If the cross-border foes want to carry out their work, is it not necessary that more vigil is maintained in Gonda?"" However, after the PM spoke, home minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament that “the prime minister did not directly mention the ISI’s name in the Kanpur train derailment case” and investigation in the three train accidents were yet to be completed by the NIA. ""If BJP loses Bihar, crackers will be burst in Pakistan."" On October 29, 2015, during Bihar Assembly polls, BJP president Amit Shah, during a rally in Raxaul,  : “  BJP   Bihar   Bihar  ,   Pakistan    ."" Not only this, the BJP placed front page advertisements in local newspapers targeting the Nitish government for being “soft on terrorists” and not taking strict action at the time of arrest of Indian Mujahideen leader Yasin Bhatkal. During the Lok Sabha election campaign, on March 26, 2014, Narendra Modi  : ""Three AKs help Pakistan. AK-47 (rifle) is used by terrorists who shed Indian blood... then there is AK Antony, the defence minister who says Indian soldiers were beheaded by persons wearing uniforms of Pakistan army, when the Army said clearly the soldiers were beheaded by Pakistan army men."" Hitting out at Arvind Kejriwal, Modi had alleged, ""The third is AK-49 - he has just given birth to a party and on his party's official website he has given away Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan. One of his associates says there should be a referendum in Kashmir. They are speaking Pakistan's language."" AK-49 was a clear reference to Kejriwal’s 49 days as chief minister of Delhi in his first stint. In 2002 Gujarat Assembly election, a day after the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee countered Pervez Musharraf’s criticism of the Gujarat killings at the UN, Modi, the then chief minister picked up the cue and converted it into an election issue. Modi  : “Mian Musharraf’s language is borrowed from the Congress. Both are saying the same thing.” He further said, “...the songs which Sonia Gandhi and some English TV channels were singing about Gujarat after Godhra have obviously been heard across the border. Now Mian Musharraf is repeating their accusations against me in an international forum. Isn’t it strange that Pakistan, which has engineered so much bloodshed in Kashmir and forced its Hindus out, should try to teach me lessons in communal harmony?” Modi went after Musharraf and said, “Mian Musharraf, the conspiracy to destabilise India was hatched in Pakistan. But you must remember there are many more Muslims in India than in your country where one Islamic sect is always fighting another. At least in India Muslims are able to live in peace.” All these examples clearly reflect that from 2002 till date, using making Pakistan a party to Indian elections has always been part of Modi-Shah’s electoral strategy. Modi suggested in 2002 that Pakistan, along with the Congress party, was conspiring to defeat him. In 2018, Amit Shah is making the same point and telling how Pakistan is working in tandem with BJP's opponent, that is, the Congress party, against the interest of Hindus and the saffron party.",2018-05-08,"BJP,Karnataka elections,Modi-Shah,Pakistan","BJP may hate Jinnah, but come elections it can't do without Pakistan",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pakistan-karnataka-elections-jinnah-mani-shankar-aiyar-modi-amit-shah-bjp-congress-tipu-sultan/story/1/23965.html
404,Minhaz Merchant,"The demand to remove   portrait from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) misses the point. The problem is not the portrait. The problem is the toxic ideas the portrait represents. All sensible Indians, Muslims and Hindus, should examine those ideas and demolish each, one by one. The portrait will then no longer matter. Mohammed Ali Jinnah was an accidental Muslim. A Gujarati Khoja, his family, like most Khojas, had been recently converted to Islam from Hinduism. He spoke fluent Gujarati but not a word of Urdu. Jinnah disdained the traditions of both conservative Hindus and Muslims. He relished pork. He drank scotch. He affected the manner of an English gentleman: waistcoat, pipe and monocle. As Akbar S Ahmed in his book, Jinnah, Pakistan and Islamic Identity: The Search for Saladin, wrote: ""Jinnah's lifestyle resembled that of the upper-class English professional. Jinnah prided himself on his appearance. He was said never to wear the same silk tie twice and had about 200 hand-tailored suits in his wardrobe. In spite of his extravagant taste in dress Jinnah remained careful with money throughout his life (he once rebuked his ADC for over-tipping the servants at the governor's house in Lahore in 1947). In the early 1930s, Jinnah lived in a large house in Hampstead, London, had an English chauffeur who drove his Bentley and an English staff to serve him. There were two cooks, Indian and Irish."" When political opportunity beckoned in the late 1930s, however, Jinnah embraced Islam with fundamentalist fervour. It is Jinnah's bigoted ideas, marinated for decades after his death by Pakistan's generals and politicians, which have turned Pakistan into a failed state. Those who blame Jinnah for Partition should thank him. Undivided India would today have been a simmering cauldron of 1.60 billion people: one billion Hindus, 550 million Muslims and 50 million others of various faiths. Muslims would have comprised over 33 per cent of India's population. That tinderbox could be lit with the smallest fundamentalist matchstick into unending civil war. History teaches us that in a country where antagonistic faiths are roughly equal in number, religious violence can be endemic. Lebanon and Northern Ireland are two diverse examples. In poor, underdeveloped Lebanon, the population is 54 per cent Muslim and 40 per cent Christian. In developed, wealthy Northern Ireland, Protestants comprise 48 per cent of the population and Catholics 45 per cent. In Lebanon, civil war raged between Muslims and Christians from 1975 to 1990, leaving 1,50,000 people dead. Deep religious and ethnic scars remain. Muslims and Christians view each other with suspicion even as Iran-backed Hezbollah, a Shia militia, now effectively controls the government in Beirut. Increasing Shia-Sunni conflicts have today led Lebanese Christians to forge secret alliances with both Muslim sects, leading to continuing communal and sectarian tensions. In Northern Ireland, Protestants and Catholics fought each other for over three decades from the 1960s to the 1990s. More than 4,000 people were killed, including scores of British policemen. Northern Ireland's legislative assembly, Stormont in Belfast, remains suspended since January 2017 following renewed disputes between warring unionist Protestants (who want to stay within the United Kingdom) and republican Catholics (who want to secede from the UK and merge with Ireland). So India must first thank Jinnah for insisting on Partition. He took with him most of his toxic thoughts to a country founded on theocracy and pre-programmed to fail. An enduring myth is that Indian Muslims identify with Pakistan. The overwhelming majority doesn't. They regard Pakistan as an embarrassment to their faith. Only a small indoctrinated minority of Muslims, especially in states like Kerala, Jammu & Kashmir and West Bengal, see kinship with Pakistan. It is this tiny minority though that foments trouble. Many are paid agents of Pakistan's ISI. They infect campuses like Jawaharlal Nehru University,   and Jamia Millia Islamia. Some mentor sleeper terror cells in J&K, Kerala and West Bengal. Hindu extremists make things worse by turning into cow vigilantes, harassing Hindu-Muslim couples under the guise of love jihad and pushing for the cause of Hindu nationalism rather than of an Indian nationalism that is plural, inclusive, and safeguards national security. This plays into the hands of the Left-Islamist narrative that right wing Hindu extremists are as dangerous as Islamist terrorists. Rahul Gandhi in 2006 fed into this twisted narrative by telling an American envoy that Hindu terror posed a greater risk to Indian security than Islamist terrorism. Much of this impacts voting patterns. Indian Muslims don't trust the BJP. By denying tickets to Muslim candidates in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has shown it has given up on the Muslim vote. That leaves Muslims with a Hobson's choice: vote for the Congress which woos them during elections but ignores them for the next five years or cast their lot with brazenly communal parties like the AIMIM, IUML, NCP, SP, RJD, TMC and NC. All are regional fiefs using Muslim victimhood to garner votes. Do they care about Muslims' prosperity? A visit to Hyderabad's old city, an Owaisi family fief, will provide a quick answer. If Indian Muslims want to share in India's transformation over the next decade from a low-income country into a middle-income global power, they must integrate into the mainstream. Be Indian first, Muslim second. The most successful and enlightened Indians - from Jawaharlal Nehru to APJ Abdul Kalam - put the nation above their religion. If India's 200 million Muslims remain segregated, prosperity will elude them as it has for the last 71 years. Scan the media: Every day dozens of start-ups announce millions of dollars in venture capital funds. Spotting a Muslim entrepreneur among these young start-up innovators is like searching for a needle in a haystack. So keep Jinnah's portrait. But integrate. Dump his theocratic bigotry that has brought Pakistan to ruin.

405,Madhuri Danthala,"In the heat of elections, no stone is left unturned to gain a favourable perception in the people’s minds. If there is not much to talk about what a party has to offer vis-à-vis development and progress, the mistakes of the political opponents are exposed. While a party may not directly make comments or cast aspersions, private individuals and even media, especially the TV channels who either overtly or covertly support a party get into the fray. However, in trying to do so, people often get carried away and indulge in mudslinging and slander. As the BJP finds itself in a tight spot, as people questioned the intention behind the party’s decision to field eight members from the infamous Reddy Brothers’ inner circle of friends and family, its supporters are in the lurch trying to defend it. 
 
 BS Yeddyurappa, whom the party had disowned earlier due to the corruption charges he faced, is widely perceived to be the chief ministerial candidate. Yeddyurappa is seen as losing clout as his rivals, the Reddy brothers, claim a chunk of the tickets to contest the elections. With such tainted candidates, it is natural that the people question the BJP about its seriousness in containing graft. Given that in the past few months, many corporate fraudsters have fled the country, (either due to sheer incompetence of the government or because it is in connivance) the supporters of the BJP are scurrying to project their failures/guilt onto other parties. For instance, the Republic TV channel, cast aspersions on the Congress social media chief, Divya Spandana, by linking her name to the fugitive corporate honcho, Vijay Mallya. In an ""exclusive"" the channel dug out tweets from Spandana’s Twitter handle between 2010 and 2012, when she was a brand ambassador for the Royal Challengers Bangalore IPL team. This, the Republic TV said would embarrass the Congress party, as its social media chief had links with the ""financial terrorist"" (as the channel described Mallya on the show). Republic TV, however, ignored the fact that the ""financial terrorist"", was an independent candidate for the Rajya Sabha, from Karnataka, and won because he was supported by the JD(S) and the BJP. With a lot of ""excess votes"", the BJP had decided to support Mallya to keep out Congress candidate TV Maruti. While such acts of omission by a TV channel that appears very close to the ruling dispensation can be taken with a pinch of salt, what is inexcusable is any individual or group casting aspersions on people’s characters. Quoting the ""exclusive"" TV report, writer and academic Madhu Kishwar questioned the character of Spandana in very despicable language, in addition to using derogatory and demeaning words for Congress president Rahul Gandhi. It is ironic that a person who claims to be a crusader for human rights would actively demean political adversaries. Rather than lead by example and promote a culture of dialogue, as is expected of intellectuals across the political spectrum, Kishwar has often been provocative on Twitter. Despite claiming to be a champion of human rights, she has often made comments that can be seen as inciting hatred among people. As the nation debated the heart-rending case of rape in Kathua, Kishwar stated that the family of the accused may have been scape-goated, for a crime committed by the ""jihadi"" Rohingyas. While she is entitled to her views, it is abhorring that a writer and academic would paint an entire community as being jihadi. While human rights crusaders are aghast about the crimes being committed against the Rohingyas, Kishwar sees nothing wrong in referring to an entire community fleeing persecution (a UN official is even convinced it is genocide) as being jihadi, which essentially is euphemism for terrorism. While in the heat of elections, many things can be ignored, such instances of casting aspersions on people’s character and sowing seeds of hatred are uncalled for. We should indulge in debate and not slander.  ",2018-05-04,"Divya Spandana,Madhu Kishwar,Elections,Smear campaign",Modi fans must understand elections are no excuse for slander,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/madhu-kishwar-smear-campaign-elections-divya-spandana-rahul-gandhi-vijay-mallya-bjp/story/1/23884.html
406,Nishat Shah,"As India grows at a rapid pace, the share of services is the major factor in our GDP growth. The share of manufacturing is steady but at an unsatisfactory level for a growing economy. The share of agriculture is declining at a rapid pace and is somewhere around 16 per cent as compared to about 58 per cent for services. This is a normal phenomenon for a growing economy that agricultural share declines, but the share of manufacturing is too low for India. What is worrying is that agriculture, which is rapidly losing its importance in GDP share, supports 58 per cent of India's population which we call rural India. We all know that there are problems in rural India and farmers are restless. And state governments are busy   to keep the unrest in check. A recent article by renowned agricultural scientist  and Shweta Saini in   analyses this unrest in detail. Our agricultural growth has declined to 2.4 per cent average for the past four years as compared to 5.2 per cent of the preceding four years that is 2010 to 2014. The growth rate has halved which is fuelling the distress. The increase in procurement prices of foodgrains has been on an average just about 3 per cent as compared to higher annual increases in preceding years. Here is the classic tale of producers versus consumers. Sharper increases in procurement prices will fuel food inflation and anger the urban voter who is the consumer. The balancing has to be done by every government and it is a tough task. The present government no doubt wanted to bring inflation under control and hence tightened procurement prices. The discontent is now being met with loan waivers and this will continue till the elections to pacify the farmers, a key voter base. The same article also talks about the two promises that our present Prime Minister made during his campaign speeches. The first was a procurement price of 50 per cent above the cost of production. The government has woken up after four years to have a look at it. Here the dispute is about what constitutes the cost of production. The farmers are demanding 50 per cent above the total cost of production while the government is looking at an alternative cost which is 38 per cent lower. The farmers are thus feeling cheated. The other promise that the prime minister had made was regarding reforms in Food Corporation of India(FCI). The reforms were regarding splitting the FCI into smaller entities and each entity would look after a specific function like procurement or storage. No progress has been so far though a committee has submitted its report. It is important that these issues are looked into urgently. It is a tragedy that such a vast proportion of India's population lives on agriculture which is not growing as rapidly as services or manufacturing. The long-term solution is faster urbanisation and that implies faster growth in the economy. But that appears some years away looking at the present growth of around 7 per cent. The government has to transfer more resources to the rural sector to keep the unrest in check and reduce rural poverty. But the first task is to push up the agricultural growth to between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. Our mainstream media pays less attention than it should to problems in the agricultural sector. The bias is clearly visible. We are more bothered about our food prices to care about the man who produces them. But that producer is also an Indian who has made India self-sufficient in foodgrain production. His continuous distress is a matter of shame for all of us. This issue needs our attention and empathy. We will be failing in our duty if we turn a blind eye to it.  ",2018-05-04,"Farmers,GDP,Modi government,Agricultural crisis",Why declining share of agriculture in GDP should worry Modi government,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/agricultural-crisis-gdp-share-farmers-modi-government-poll-promises-farm-loan-waivers/story/1/23901.html
407,Nikhil Wagle,"In a landmark Marathi film,  , made by renowned filmmaker Jabbar Patel in 1974, a question is often asked in a hushed tone: ""What happened to Maruti Kamble?"". The film revolves around the clout of a sugar baron in a village of Maharashtra, who falsely implicated a former military man, Kamble, killed him because he could challenge his economic progress, and passed it off as suicide. Fishiness of the developments, and the fear of the sugar baron, ensures people only ask this question in a hushed voice. Today, time has come to ask a similar question: What happened to  ? She was an important witness in the  . She, along with her brother, had helplessly watched her house in the village of Wada being burnt down by a mob of 150, following which she had received death threats. Her brother even filed a complaint in February, but police typically ignored it. On April 22, Pooja’s body was found in a well near her home. She had gone missing before that, and the police hadn’t even realised it is a witness whose life is at stake. The police woke up after recovering her body. Her chappals had been found outside the well, and the police concluded it’s a suicide, without even looking for a note. Initially, they wanted to conduct the post-mortem in a local hospital, but after her family protested, the police charged Rs 2,000 from them and transferred the body to Pune. 
 
Pooja’s family consistently maintained it’s a murder. Even  speculated along similar lines. After which, the police investigated seriously and arrested nine under IPC Section 306 (abetment to suicide), and Section 34 of the Scheduled Castes And Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. It includes the ones who set her home ablaze, and threatened her family members. But it would be difficult to say whether it is a suicide or murder until the results of post-mortem are out, say police. Because the police investigation has been lackadaisical, the ones initiating the Bhima Koregaon Yatra founded a  , which reveals that police never examined the spot where Pooja’s body was found. Further, Pooja’s body hadn’t been bloated, indicating it wasn’t in water for a very long time. The wounds on the body were fresh and the nose was bleeding. It begs the question whether the police were trying save anyone. One does not have to be a Sherlock Holmes to know the people burning her home and threatening her. They had been summoned to the police station a few times. Yet, when Pooja’s brother complained, why was it ignored? Who benefits from losing a key witness in the Bhima Koregaon violence? Pooja’s father Suresh has been an old foe of the radical Hindutvawadis in their village. On January 1, they had called for a bandh in the vicinity of Bhima Koregaon, and Suresh had bravely defied it. With his colleague Ashok Athavle, Suresh initiated the prabodhan rally, organised blood donation camps and so on. And as revenge, his home was reduced to ashes the following day. But the police did not extend any protection to the family. Even when the family determinedly began reconstructing the house, and received further threats. Since January 1, the area has been polarised with vicious atmosphere. After Pooja’s death, it has intensified. And within a fortnight of her death, the village has planned to drive out the Sakat family, for Suresh, who hails from the Matang community, is apparently “defaming the village” by filing false cases. The gram panchayat here is acting like khap panchayat. The government should, in fact, prosecute it. This is a story of a Dalit household in a supposedly progressive state. It is a tragic reminder of the kind of life Ambedkar’s followers are meted out.The ones who organised the riots at Bhima Koregaon are roaming free.   was arrested after a long time and received bail in a short time. But  is still untouched. We must also remember that Pooja's mysterious death transpired after Ekbote’s release. In the meantime, however, Ambedkarites are being labelled Naxals. The horrified image of Pooja’s bloodstained body continues to haunt me. News stories about her mystifying death did appear in the media, but hardly has anyone followed it up with vigour. Nobody took to the streets for her, nobody ran hashtags. In all likelihood, we will forget about her after a while.

408,Nadim Asrar,"The Sangh Parivar's abhorrence for and denial of history makes a lot of sense. After all, the project of a ""Hindu Rashtra"" needs a clean slate. Any resemblance to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan here is not a coincidence. There is only one little hitch. The fantasy of India as a clean slate to make it a playground for Hindutva fascism is threatened by the country's plural history and syncretism. No matter how many Mughalsarais are renamed as Deen Dayal Upadhyay stations, Aurangzeb Roads changed to APJs, or Taj Mahals converted into Shiva temples called Tejo Mahalayas, there simply is no way to erase the remnants of the long journey India has undertaken before it turned into a republic. If only they knew a nation is not a destination, but a perpetual contest between competing identities. Moreover, a nation is about its people, and people have a tendency to hold on to their past. It helps them in identifying and asserting themselves in a contested democracy. The latest in that long saga of the Sangh anxiety is a portrait of   hung on one of the walls of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students' union office. After nearly 80 years of its innocuous presence inside the building, which also has portraits of Dr BR Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi among others, a BJP parliamentarian wants it removed and has suggested so in his letter to the AMU administration. A suggestion disguised more as a threat. A report today said chief minister Yogi Adityanath's mercenaries in Hindu Yuva Vahini have asked AMU to remove the picture within 48 hours, failing which they will do it themselves. So, why does the Sangh hate Jinnah? Like it happens with most cases of hatred, it's again born out of ignorance. That Jinnah was the founder of Pakistan, and hence responsible for India's Partition, is as reductionist as to suggest Mahatma Gandhi was behind India's independence from the colonial rule. AMU as an institution is nearly 150 years old now. It started off as Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875 and turned into a university in 1920, decades before India's independence. The university is the product of a certain moment in history, when elites and educationists - which included not only Muslims, but also Hindus and ""reformist"" British - led by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan decided to impart modern education to the Muslim community, which was the worst victim of the brutal aftermath of the 1857 rebellion. With the arrival of Gandhi and the launch of a formal freedom movement, as our NCERT books suggest, AMU, like all other universities in those days, responded to it. That it turned out to be a major platform for Muslims to rally around should surprise nobody. Jinnah, in that context, became popular on the Aligarh campus. Yet, Jinnah was not the first person that the AMU students' union awarded its prestigious life membership to. That honour was given, rightly so, to Gandhi in the 1920s. In subsequent years, other national leaders, including Ambedkar, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sir CV Raman, Jai Prakash Narayan and others were made life members of the students' union. Jinnah made the cut in 1938. Like portraits of most leaders inside the union building, Jinnah also found a spot. That portrait has been hanging at the AMU students' union hall for decades, and yet, it did not turn AMU into another Pakistan. The university remains a premier central institution, funded by the government itself. Did, for example, portraits of British colonialists-cum-orientalists, found in most top universities across India, turn them into Oxford or Cambridge? A university like AMU is more than a university. It is also a historical artefact, a realisation of the Aligarh Movement in concrete, literally. AMU, like most of India's artefacts, tells us about the long journey the idea of India has undertaken with all its complexities and contradictions. The past is not an annoying neighbour you decide to stay away from. So, let's be clear here, and acknowledge this new aggression under the current regime to destabilise AMU, just like the regime has destabilised other premier institutions, including JNU, which was also declared anti-national by the same forces. The idea is to paint Muslims as divisive, and having affiliations with and sympathies for Pakistan. The Jinnah row also comes a week after the RSS said it will hold a shakha on the campus. The design is to polarise the country ahead of multiple elections in various states this year, and the crucial Lok Sabha election in 2019. For a party and a government whose only priority is to win elections, there is no reason to believe that the Jinnah story will end here. The portrait in AMU will no more be frozen in time, as it has been so far. It will be retouched, and a fresh coat of stereotypes and suspicions about Indians Muslims will be put on it.

409,Sagarneel Sinha,"The situation in trouble-torn Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state, seems to be getting worse. The   is facing an uphill task to contain the deteriorating situation. The PDP, which was earlier known for its soft-separatist stance, mainly represents the Kashmir valley while the BJP represents Jammu and Ladakh regions. Kashmir valley is largely a Muslim region and Jammu is a Hindu majority region with a chunk of Muslim and a sizeable Sikh population. The third region - Ladakh - has Muslim (mostly Shia), Buddhist and Hindu population. It seems the marriage between the ruling alliance partners haven't been received well by the people of the state. While the BJP is facing pressure from the people of Jammu and Ladakh for allegedly ignoring the development of the two regions, the PDP too is losing its base rapidly in the Valley as majority of them are angry with Mehbooba Mufti's change in stance - from pro-separatist stance to a pro-India - and her strong handling of the separatists and stone-pelters. In the past three years while the BJP and the PDP were busy managing their alliance, the state has seen a considerable rise in militancy in the Valley. According to data presented by the chief minister in the state legislature, as many as 66 youths  in 2015, 88 in 2016, and 126 in 2017. These figures clearly point to the rising separatism in the Valley. According to the Union home ministry, the state  . Last year, the state witnessed civilian deaths numbering to 40, highest among the past five years. However, Indian security forces got a major breakthrough in eliminating 213 militants in 2017 compared to 150 in 2016 and 108 in 2015, with a reduction 2.44 per cent casualty of security forces. Despite that, the Valley's ground remains fertile for the growth of separatism with the rise of stone-pelters who tend to protect the terrorists from the bullets of the security forces even at the cost of their own lives. On the other hand, the Hindu-majority Jammu, which became the hometown of Kashmiri Pandits who were forced to move away from the Valley, is apprehensive of the ""rising presence"" of Rohingya refugees in Jammu. The Jammu residents see it as a ploy of the anti-India forces to alter the social demography by sheltering Muslim Rohingyas in the region. Even security forces fear the hand of ISI agents brainwashing the migrants. There have instances that raised concerns among the security agencies. In 2015, a militant killed by security forces in South Kashmir originally belonged to Rakhine, the epicentre of Rohingya crisis in Myanmar. According to an  , 27 Rohingya families residing illegally in Jammu owned SIM cards. The revelation raised eyebrows as to how the SIM cards were obtained, given that Rohingyas don't have citizenship documents. Added to all that, the recent brutal gang-rape of a minor Muslim girl in Kathua, Jammu, has exposed the ever-widening fissures between Hindus and Muslims in the state. The people of Jammu demanded a CBI inquiry (still demanding) instead of a state police probe due to their distrust in the CM. This shows that the people have lost confidence in the state government. Mehbooba Mufti should have sensed the concerns of the Hindu majority Jammu residents. PDP's junior partner BJP too has failed to honour the aspirations of the people. To make matters worse, the BJP recently inducted Rajiv Jasrotia, BJP's Kathua MLA – who took part in the rally organised by Hindu Ekta Manch (HEM) seeking a CBI probe into the rape and murder of the eight-year-old girl – into the council of ministers besides some other pro-Hindutva faces. What's more, within an hour of the cabinet shuffle in Jammu and Kashmir on April 30, the new deputy chief minister,  , shocked everybody with his statement on the Kathua rape and murder by calling it a ""chhoti si baat (minor issue)"". Jammu and Kashmir needs a strong political desire to root out the mess created by separatism and divisive politics in the state, which is today more divided than ever under the PDP-BJP alliance government.  ",2018-05-02,"Militancy,Kathua rape,PDP-BJP alliance,Jammu and Kashmir",Why the gulf between Jammu and Kashmir has widened under PDP-BJP rule,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-pdp-bjp-alliance-kathua-rape-militancy-rohingya-migrants/story/1/23837.html
410,Kaveree Bamzai,"There is only one response to every side that is involved in this noisy but pointless debate on ""Indian heritage for sale"". Alexander Pope's well-known quote: ''A little learning is a dangerous thing/Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring/There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain/and drinking largely sobers us again.” One cannot really blame KJ Alphons for not knowing the history of his ministry. Despite being a former IAS officer, he seems woefully short on facts, and was most recently quoted as  , ""Indians have no problem stripping naked when applying for visa, but complain of privacy intrusion when the government asks for their personal details."" The white man's bogey seems to be a particularly favourite theme of his, no doubt to please his minister Mahesh Sharma, who seems rather partial to the Sangh Parivar. So how does he counter criticism of the Monument Mitra scheme under which   has adopted the Red Fort? Not by telling the truth: which is the Adopt a Heritage scheme is the same as the National Culture Fund with more branding being allowed to corporates. No, instead he raises the ""foreign hand"" bogey. He is quoted in    as  : ""The UPA government led by it had itself gone ahead to hand over the restoration and maintenance task of at least five monuments to a foreign agency, that is, the Aga Khan Trust."" The story goes on to say: ""Under its (UPA’s) National Culture Fund, the then government had reached out to many corporate for preservation and conservation of heritage monuments,” and Alphons said that ""While under the NCF, the UPA had doled out money to the agencies like Aga Khan Trust, in our scheme it is the corporates which is putting in money for its maintenance.'' Those three statements are wrong on so many levels. Here's how: 1) The National Culture Fund (NCF) was set up under the Ministry of Culture in 1996, at the initiative of HRD minister, the late SR Bommai, and culture secretary BP Singh, during the United Front government. There was no sign of UPA or Congress then. All Mr Alphons needs to do is either speak to Mr Singh who now lives a retired life in Delhi, or read the second edition of his book,  . 2) The MoU between NCF and ASI and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture was initially for the garden restoration of Humayun's Tomb. It was signed in 1999, when the BJP was in power. Yes, the BJP. 3) The MoU did not involve ""doling out money"" to the trust. The trust invested its own money initially and then raised money from other organisations such as Tata Trusts and The Oberoi Group. The project, completed in 2013, in collaboration with the ASI, has seen the complete revival of Humayun's Tomb, and a number of adjoining monuments such as Nila Gumbad, Isa Khan's garden tomb, Bu Halima's garden tomb, Arab Serai gateways, Sunderawala Mahal and Burj, Batashewala group of monuments, Chausath Khamba and Hazrat Nizamuddin Baoli. The Aga Khan Trust for Culture does not need any tax breaks in India, since it is not a ""corporate"", its follow-up MoU in 2007 to conserve Humayun’s mausoleum and 50 other sites has been with the ASI itself. It works at the pleasure of the ASI and under its constant monitoring. It has to get everything approved in writing and a lot of research and documentation goes into that. It has received grants from the Ministry of Tourism for some work but otherwise has spent its own money as a grant, without any possibility for recovery of funds. 4) As part of its work around Humayun's Tomb, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture also restored the adjoining 90-acre park inspired by Mughal Garden traditions. Created by landscape architect M Shaheer, the garden includes a 600-metre ""paradise carpet garden"", a 30-acre micro-habitat zone with provisions for birds, an amphitheatre for cultural events and 20 acres of nursery beds that the Central Public Works Department regularly uses. This is called Sunder Nursery, yes the very same one where Prime Minister Narendra Modi took   for a much publicised walk in March. If this is a foreign agency, it is one sanctified by no less than Prime Minister Modi. 5) The NCF existed and continues to exist to attract corporate funding for restoration of monuments. The list of projects under it is long and if Mr Alphons cares to read it, he can see how much money has been   by organisations. Among several corporations, the NTPC will spend Rs 5 crore for five years and the ONGC will spend Rs 2 crore for five years.",2018-05-02,"Tourism Ministry,Culture Ministry,Dalmia Bharat,Red fort",Red Fort 'adoption': Why tourism minister needs to get his facts right,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/red-fort-kj-alphons-indian-heritage-for-sale-dalmia-bharat-group-culture-tourism-upa-bjp/story/1/23839.html
411,Kumar Shakti Shekhar,"By reconstituting its Madhya Pradesh unit ahead of the Assembly election, the Congress seeks to maintain regional and caste balance. However, the party has completely overlooked two communities - Brahmins and minorities (read Muslims) - in the latest exercise. In the April 26 reshuffle, while Kamal Nath has been made president of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC), Jyotiraditya Scindia has been appointed as chairperson of the campaign committee for the state. Apart from the two, the MPCC now has four working presidents - Bala Bachchan, Ramniwas Rawat, Jitu Patwari and Surender Choudhary. Ajay Singh and Rajendra Singh remain the leader of Opposition and deputy speaker, respectively, in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly. While Nath, Ajay Singh and Rajendra Singh belong to the general category, Scindia, Rawat and Patwari belong to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. Besides, Bachchan comes from the Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Choudhary from the Scheduled Caste (SC) category. Of the four leaders belonging to the general category, Nath comes from the traders' community while Ajay Singh and Rajendra Singh are Thakurs. However, Brahmins are conspicuous by their absence from the list of leaders holding key posts in the MP Congress. Two senior Brahmin leaders, former MP Satyavrat Chaturvedi and former Union minister Suresh Pachauri, have remained sidelined for some time now. Though Brahmins constitute only about 6 per cent of the state's population, they are a dominant caste. They wield influence on other castes. This does not bode well for the Congress in the state as Brahmins may turn hostile towards the party over the issue. On the other hand, this may help the BJP, which has given adequate representation to the Brahmins both in government and administration. Apart from Brahmins, Muslims also have not got due representation on any key post in MP Congress. Such is the state of affairs that five-time MLA, Arif Aqueel, who has won all Assembly elections since 1990, too has not been given any key post in MPCC. Considered to be Congress general secretary   acolyte, Aqueel is the only Muslim MLA in MP Assembly. He was the only Muslim MLA even in the previous Assembly. Despite this, he has not been given any important responsibility by the party leadership. While Muslims are believed to support the Congress, MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been trying to reach out to the minority community. Unlike Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several BJP leaders, Chouhan attends iftar parties and also occasionally wears the skull cap. He is considered a moderate among the BJP leaders. With Congress ignoring the Muslims, a part of the community may turn against the party. Madhya Pradesh is primarily divided into five geographical regions - Malwa-Nimar, Bundelkhand, Gwalior-Chambal, Mahakaushal and Vindhya. The Congress has given representation to all the five regions. While Nath belongs to the Mahakaushal region, Scindia and Rawat belong to the Gwalior-Chambal region, Bachchan and Patwari hail from Malwa-Nimar belt, Choudhary belongs to Bundelkhand and Ajay Singh and Rajendra Singh to the Vindhya region. Though Digvijaya Singh, who was the MP chief minister for two consecutive terms from 1993 to 2003, has been left out, he enjoys the maximum support among those holding the key posts. Leaving out Nath and Scindia, of the six other senior leaders, three - Choudhary, Ajay Singh and Rajendra Singh - are Digvijaya loyalists. Of the remaining three, Rawat is considered close to Scindia and Bachchan to Nath. Patwari, who was MP Youth Congress president, is known for his proximity to Congress president Rahul Gandhi. With this new team in place now, the Congress hopes to defeat the BJP, which has been in power for three consecutive terms since 2003, when the state goes to poll this year. Rahul Gandhi may have tried to end factionalism by attaching due importance to Nath and Scindia but he needs to infuse greater enthusiasm in the party workers to take on the well-oiled election machinery of the BJP.",2018-05-01,"Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Jyotiraditya Scindia,Assembly election,Madhya Pradesh election",Will Congress' reconstituted team in Madhya Pradesh be able to take on BJP?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/madhya-pradesh-election-assembly-election-jyotiraditya-scindia-kamal-nath-shivraj-singh-chouhan/story/1/23808.html
412,M Reyaz,"Bomb blasts and terror attacks have become so normal in   that within hours of any such incident, the rest of the city, except the grieving families, continues with its daily chores. Even the international media appears to have long forgotten the Afghan war, and casualties in terrorist attacks have been reduced to mere numbers. But even by Kabul standards, Monday's twin blasts by purported ISIS terrorists was a bleak reminder that the longest war that the United States had declared after 9/11 to end terrorism is far from over. Only last week, ISIS attacks at   centres in Kabul and Baghlan province had killed at least 63 and injured more than hundred others. As a blast was heard in the Shash Darak area of the Afghan capital, brave journalists came to cover the event while locals gathered to help the injured, like they always do. A second suicide bomber who was carrying a camera himself to “blend” among the media personnel, according to police, just then detonated his bomb. This was clearly the deadliest day in the history of Afghan media since the fall of Taliban. In a clear case of “shooting the messenger”, among 31 dead so far nine were journalists. The list of dead included chief photographer of AFP in Kabul, Shah Marai, three journalists of Radio Liberty, locally known as Radio Azadi - Maharram Durrani, Ebadullah Hananzai and Sabawoon Kakar. TOLO News cameraman Yar Mohammad Tokhi, 1TV journalists Ghazi Rasooli and Nowroz Ali Rajabi, Saleem Talash and Ali Saleemi of Mashal TV were also among the dead. At least eight other journalists were injured.  The   has claimed the Kabul twin attacks, claiming they have killed the “apostates”. In a separate targeted assassination, BBC Pashto service reporter Ahmad Shah was the 10th journalist killed in the Khost province on the same day.  Ruchi Kumar, one of few foreign journalists still based in Kabul, described the Monday attack as “surreal”. She  , “As the death toll continued to rise, it still seemed surreal that so many of our colleagues had paid such a heavy price just for doing their jobs. Even as reports continue to pour in across social media, there were few visuals, if any, of the attacks, because nearly all of Kabul's photojournalists and videographers had either been killed, injured or were in shock.” On a bloody Monday,   in a school in Kandahar province when suicide bomber detonated a car targeting a Romanian patrolling troop. Sixteen more people, including five Romanian soldiers, were wounded. This is not the first time journalists have been targeted in Afghanistan. Another BBC journalist Abdul Manan Arghand was killed in Kandahar last week on his way to work. In November, last year, Pashto language   was attacked by ISIS terrorists posing as policemen, killing at least one and injuring  20. In 2016, terrorists stormed the headquarters of  , killing at least seven and leaving over 25 wounded. Besides targeted killing, journalists have also been victims of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. In the famous 2014   attack, AFP journalist Sardar Ahmad was shot dead along with his wife and two children. At least 15 media professionals were killed last year in targeted attacks according to Reporters without Borders (RSF).  Earlier, the   (AJSC) reported 101 incidents of violence (including 13 deaths) against media workers in 2016, up sharply from 73 in 2015.  categorises Afghanistan as “partly free” (Indian media is also considered “partly free”), but the media-scape of the war-torn country remains the single biggest success story of post-Taliban era.  In fact, Afghanistan fares better than most in the region.   Afghanistan 118 (two places better than 2017) in 2018 World Press Freedom Index (India is 138, Pakistan 139 and Iran 164). For a country marred in conflict and civil war for over three decades, mushrooming of a vibrant civil society, increasing number of grassroots organisations and local NGOs, as also increasing number of media houses are biggest achievements of last two decades. Television and cinema were considered haram (forbidden) by the reactionary Taliban regime and hence even TV antennas were destroyed. None of the TV or radio channels were allowed to broadcast, except the state-owned Shariat Radio that served as the mouthpiece for the regime. Similar was the fate of the newspapers. The Northern Alliance-administered North Afghanistan had managed to run Badakhshan Television, broadcasting news and films for around 5,000 viewers for three hours a day. With the help of foreign aid, the country has seen unmatched growth in the field of information and communication. From almost no electronic media until 2002, today Afghanistan has 110 TV channels and 304 radio stations, according to Afghanistan Telecom Regulatory Authority (ATRA). During the Taliban period, to make international calls one needed to come to Peshawar, Pakistan. By  , approximately 89 per cent of population came under mobile telephone coverage. Afghanistan today has more than 21.5 million active GSM subscribers.  Afghan entrepreneurs have in fact launched some of the most ambitious and creative projects. In May last year, Zan TV, Afghanistan’s first and only TV station run by and for women, was launched. In the same month, first issue of a  like lifestyle magazine, for women called   was published. Headquartered in Dubai, Saad Mohseni’s Moby Group is largest Afghan media conglomerate running TOLO TV, TOLO News, Arman FM, 101India, and Vice Middle East and North Africa, among others.  According to Afghan parliamentarian and chairperson of Women, Civil Society and Human Rights Commission, Fawzia Koofi, “Taliban and Daesh (IS) continue to target our innocent people and civilians. They particularly attack journalists as they think, that way they can attract more attentions.” She further said that terrorists have “no respect for media and freedom of speech since they reveal their crimes,” adding, “They are against any progress.”",2018-05-01,"Kabul,ISIS,Terror attack,Afghanistan",Twin blasts in Kabul: Why terrorists are targeting the fledgling Afghan media,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/afghanistan-twin-blasts-isis-terror-kabul-journalists-killed-afp-chief-photographer-shah-marai-security-forces/story/1/23809.html
413,Minhaz Merchant,"Chinese President Xi Jinping is a princeling: his father Xi Zhongxum was a senior political leader in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi comes from a humbler background, but the two men have one quality in common: ruthlessness. The   in Wuhan marked only the opening move in an elaborate chess game between the duo. Afghanistan is the chess board. Xi wants India to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), though China’s vice-foreign minister  said in Wuhan, “China won’t force it on India to or be too hard on it.” Without India’s participation, however, the BRI will lack legitimacy. Kong’s statement is, therefore, more pragmatic than definitive. Enter Afghanistan. Xi knows that the United States is already encouraging India to play a larger economic role in Afghanistan. The decision by Xi and Modi to work jointly on economic projects in Afghanistan satisfies three Chinese concerns and two Indian ones. First, India-China   will indirectly draw India into the BRI which, as Xi announced late last year, will extend to Afghanistan. Second, for that to happen, peace must return to Afghanistan with the Pakistan-sponsored Taliban joining an Afghan coalition government at some stage. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of the BRI, already faces security threats from Baloch insurgents. Restoring peace in the region is therefore key to BRI’s success. India’s economic role in Afghanistan, now backed by China, can help. Third, a deeper economic partnership in the region between India and China will, Xi hopes, help wean India away from the US orbit of influence. Xi is keenly aware that by 2030 the world’s three largest economies will be the United States, China and India. In this geopolitical triangle, China and the US will form the two largest angles and India the smallest. But though the smallest, India will be the swing power. Whoever it aligns with – China or the US – will have the edge. Xi sees US-China rivalry in Cold War terms. As this century unfolds, India will increasingly play, in this new Great Power rivalry, the role Britain played during the Cold War between the US-led West and the Soviet Union. With Britain, an emasculated power, and Europe, entrapped in pacifism, India is the only regional power with a large economic and military presence that the US can rely on to counter China. Hence comes the carefully crafted change in India-US joint statements, highlighting the Indo-Pacific rather than the Asia-Pacific, giving prominence to the Indian navy’s strengths in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). It is a doctrine that conflicts with Xi’s ambitions in the region. Xi knows that India and the US are developing a strong strategic military partnership. That is why he played the “pan-Asian” card with Modi. In Wuhan, Xi spoke emphatically of China and India as Asian powers building a “globalised and multipolar world” together. As a shrewd strategist, Modi sees two benefits from Xi’s gameplan. The first is neutralising Pakistan. While Xi has his own geostrategic reasons for drawing India into a pan-Asian orbit, Modi knows that joint India-China economic projects in Afghanistan will cool Pakistan’s fevered opposition to India’s growing role in a country Islamabad has long coveted as part of its strategic depth theory. The second benefit for India in Xi’s new overtures is that a joint India-China co-operation lowers the temperature on the eastern front. With India’s military still under-equipped to fight a two-front war, a modus vivendi with Beijing will help the Indian Army focus on counter-terrorism operations in Jammu & Kashmir and infiltration of terrorists across the Line of Control (LoC). Will Pakistan buy into the emerging India-China entente cordiale? Clearly not. But it may have little choice. Geopolitical alignments are changing rapidly. China and the US are locked in a trade war. China’s exports to the US are over $500 billion. China’s imports from the US, at $170 billion, are only a third of that. Beijing is, therefore, vulnerable to punishing trade tariffs that US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose. Developments in the Korean peninsula have also worried China. The meeting last week between South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un came as a result of US, not Chinese, pressure. The proposed Trump-Kim summit will sideline China. Beijing has been ruled out as a venue. Mongolia or Singapore is likely to be the venue for the historic summit. As Jane Perlez wrote in  China finds itself removed from the center of the rapidly unfolding diplomacy, and is unusually wary about Mr. Kim’s objectives in reaching out to his nation’s two bitterest enemies (South Korea and the United States). With events moving so quickly, and Beijing finding itself largely left on the outside, analysts say China and its leader, Xi Jinping, must at least consider what they called worst-case contingencies. The loss of prestige is a big problem for China and Xi, who wants everyone else to view China as an essential actor of international relations. So China fears the outcome could be either a North Korea or a unified Korean Peninsula leaning toward the United States.” A unified Korea could, despite Xi’s endorsement of the peace treaty between Moon and Kim, be a nightmare for Beijing. Since the 1950-1953 Korean war, China has used North Korea as a buffer state to keep 28,000 US troops stationed in South Korea at a safe distance. A unified Korea could bring them to China’s doorstep. Increasingly isolated and in Trump’s crosshairs, Xi’s pragmatism has compelled him to launch his charm offensive and seek co-operation with India rather than confrontation. The possibility of Doklam 2 has significantly receded. Modi’s next move on the chessboard will be interesting. Pakistan-abetted terrorism needs to end. Membership to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and designating Masood Azhar as a global terrorist will form part of the agenda of future Modi-Xi meetings. The balance of power between Beijing and New Delhi has shifted subtly. Both Xi and Modi know that Afghanistan is where the winning moves in this elaborate geopolitical chess game will be made.",2018-05-01,"Doklam,Xi Jinping,Narendra Modi,India-China Ties",Why Modi and Xi Jinping are new grandmasters of the geopolitical chess game,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-china-ties-narendra-modi-xi-jinping-doklam-obor-unified-korea-us-pakistan-nsg-masood-azhar/story/1/23805.html
414,Madhuri Danthala,"As a child, like most girls in my school, I held Dr Kiran Bedi in high esteem. For many of us girls from small town India, she was the epitome of women’s emancipation. However, since she has entered political life, she has lost much of her sheen. Of course, we still respect her for her achievements, but she’s not someone I look up to anymore. I was appalled to learn from a friend (he too is an ex-admirer of Dr. Bedi) that, as the Lt. Governor of Puducherry, she had ordered that the free rice scheme be implemented only if the local MLAs and Panchayat Commissioners certify that the villages are open defecation free (ODF) and garbage free. She subsequently  after drawing a lot of flak, and clarified that her intention wasn’t to deny poor people of their entitlement. However noble one’s intentions may be, we cannot be insensitive to the plight of those who live in penury. Setting them free from the squalor they are confined to requires a compassionate approach, and the state, as well as the better-off citizens, ought to display utmost sensitivity to the most vulnerable sections of society. This insensitivity of treating poor people as a burden on society is quite deep among the well to do. Bedi’s order brings into focus the debate around rice schemes, which are criticised by middle and upper classes as election gimmicks. The southern states are often mocked for the subsidised schemes that dominate electoral discourse. Very often, it is argued in middle class circles that “doles” such as free rice programmes or highly subsidised food are a bane on India’s economy. It is also suggested that such schemes make people “lazy” and they are exploited by political parties for their votes. In fact, when the  was being implemented in 2013, many people said it would be a burden on the exchequer. BJP MP Pratap Simha (then a columnist with  ) had castigated the newly formed Siddaramaiah government for implementing the Anna Bhagya scheme before the Food Security Act came into force. In an article he penned on July 13, 2013, he claimed that such schemes drain out the state’s coffers and encourage laziness. However, people who believe that such schemes make the poor lazy are oblivious to ground realities. It is often said that being poor results in more expenses. When people don’t have access to nutritious food, they tend to fall sick more often, and hence their medical expenses rise. Any government that seeks equitable and social justice will therefore provide them with access to subsidised food. Only those who are oblivious to the plight of the poor will argue that such schemes encourage laziness. Further, those who claim that subsidising the food of the poor is a drain on the exchequer conveniently ignore the many “incentives” given to the corporates and large companies. The “incentives” essentially are subsidies. Yet not many criticise the fact that the corporates receive a lot more “incentives” than what governments spend on subsidies. It is argued that large companies create jobs and hence add value to the economy. Again, it is conveniently ignored that a healthy population is a prerequisite for economic development, and hence any cost incurred should be seen as an investment rather than wastage. Cleanliness and hygiene obviously are important. In fact, they too add to solving the larger problem and ensure a healthy population. But the responsibility for ensuring that should be pinned on the authorities. The poor should not be penalised for what is essentially lack of civic sense, which all sections of the society are guilty of. Despite having large ecological footprints, the middle classes often indulge in mocking the poor. It is this contempt for the poor that makes us such an insensitive society. We must fight poverty, not the poor.  ",2018-04-29,"National Food Security Act,Open Defecation,Subsidy,Kiran Bedi","Kiran Bedi’s ‘no toilets, no free rice’ order was shockingly insensitive",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kiran-bedi-no-toilets-no-free-rice-puducherry-subsidies/story/1/23773.html
415,Rana Safvi,"So has the Red Fort really been passed off to a private body? In September 2017, the ministry of tourism, government of India launched what it called “ , Project for the development of Tourist Friendly Destinations September 2017”. As part of it, private or public sector companies/individuals would “adopt” heritage structure for upkeep, and be called “Monument Mitras”. The rationale given for this was that since India was a culturally rich country and tourism was on steady rise, there was a need to provide basic amenities to tourists on an immediate basis, and advanced amenities on a long-term basis. The vision statement of the project  , “Ministry of tourism in close collaboration with ministry of culture and Archeological Survey of India (ASI) envisages developing the heritage sites, monuments and any other tourist sites by making them tourist-friendly to enhance the tourism potential and their cultural importance, in a planned and phased manner.” The objectives of the project listed on the government document are: Under this scheme, the group selected will provide tourists with amenities such as clean toilets and drinking water, illumination, signage, Wifi, multi-lingual audio guides, cloakroom, canteen, advanced surveillance system (Like PTZ based CCTV cameras), tourist facilitation cum interpretation centres (tourist multi-purpose centre) which will have facilities such as museums, shopping/souvenir shops, cloakroom, toilet, drinking water, money exchange ,digital interactive kiosk, digital (LED) screening, light and sound shows with regular cultural shows, battery-operated vehicles and advanced tourist flow management system linked with carrying capacity of the monuments.   There will be expert committees to oversee the projects, and 93 monuments based on footfall have been identified for it. In the case of Red Fort a memorandum of understanding was signed between Dalmia Bharat Limited and the ministry of tourism, ministry of culture and the Archaeological Survey of India on April 9. The ministry of tourism went public with the deal on April 25, and on April 28, the general public got to know via an   that the Red Fort was being adopted by the Dalmia Bharat Group.  There seems nothing objectionable to this on the surface. Yet, as soon as the news was announced, social media was abuzz with messages that the iconic Red Fort had been sold.    
 
   
 
  The supporters were not far behind. 
 
   There was speculation that the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) could be involved in the project too, so I contacted Swapna Liddle, the convener of INTACH’s Delhi Chapter, for her views. Liddle said INTACH was not involved in the process, but “As for the adoption, it is about building and maintaining visitor amenities. Considering that right now, these are really poor, this might be a good idea. The ASI, I trust, will play a proactive role to ensure that the aspects concerned with historical information – signage, interpretation centres, audio guides, etc., will be approved by experts. The building and maintaining of an interpretation centre will also be the responsibility of the group that adopts the heritage building. Interpretation centres give a brief history of the monument, its conservation record, etc. Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, chairman and coordinator, CAS in History and coordinator, University Museum, AMU, who is an expert in medieval Indian history and archaeology, is more alarmed at the consequences of such “adoptions”. He feels history maybe “tailored” here. Rezavi has also been protesting the handing over of Humayun’s Tomb and its surrounding area to the Aga Khan Trust. In the 2014 Indian History Congress session held in JNU, Delhi, a resolution was passed against the conservation of Humayun’s Tomb being done by the Aga Khan Trust. Rezavi said: “Actually, it’s a very sad day for India! Even our monuments and past are being commercialised. This is a step far more dangerous than we can imagine at the moment. The first baby step in this direction was taken when Humayun’s Tomb was handed over to the Aga Khan Trust, and its technocrats destroyed its authenticity to convert it into a modern money-spinning enterprise.” However, there are arguments that the ASI is too starved of funds to give the monuments the care they need and deserve. KK Mohammad, regional director (retired), ASI, says: “ASI faces a cash crunch, which has an impact on infrastructure and facilities at the monuments. In the light of this, the adoption is a good step. ASI doesn’t have the manpower to manage these huge monuments. They need toilets, parking pathways and interpretation centres, which is beyond the capacity of the ASI and its straitened finances.” Since there are so many conflicting opinions, let us examine what is really happening here. The  , or Red Fort, will complete 400 years on June 15. It was on June 15, 1648 AD, that Shah Jahan entered the Qila e Mubarak and illuminated the grounds with his blessed presence. A per the ministry of tourism  : “The fourth party [Monument Mitra] agrees during the period of adoption that no revenue will be generated from the public as collection fee, convenience fee etc. However, in case any fees are planned to be charged, it will be subjected to specific clearance of the relevant Government parties to the MoU.” The contract has been given to the Dalmia Bharat group for Rs25 crore for 5 years. According to the    : “The  Bharat group will charge people visiting the  after getting specific clearances from the m and the ministry of tourism. Any revenue generated through the activities planned by the corporate house would also have to be ploughed back into the Fort's development and maintenance. ” The project is supposed to be done from the company’s CSR funds and is a non-profit enterprise. Since I write on heritage and have an upcoming book on the iconic Red Fort, I have researched its past and present thoroughly. I have also found about ASI ticket sales in monuments. As per figures given by the Ministry of Culture in Lok Sabha, just the Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan, has an average annual ticket sale of over Rs 21 crore (last year saw a drop in visitors to the Taj Mahal and figures stood at Rs 17.8 crore).   The Qutub Complex generates over Rs 10 crore in ticket sales, Red Fort and Humayun’s Tomb generate around Rs 6 crore each.  This money goes directly to the ministry of culture, which allocates funds to various monuments. I know the Red Fort got a measly Rs 50 lakh a year allocation till two years ago. In this scenario, the Dalmia Bharat Group will be collecting Rs 6 crore X 5 years = Rs30 crore. Once they improve infrastructure, the sales will go up, as they did in the case of Humayun’s Tomb. So how much of their own funds will be pumped in? Again, according to the    : “The Dalmia Bharat Group would be allowed to charge visitors for semi-commercial activities that it plans to conduct. The “reasonability of the rates charged for the services” would be determined by a joint committee headed by representatives of the Archaeological Survey of India, Ministry of Culture and the Dalmia Bharat Group. All revenues generated from these “semi-commercial activities” would need to be deposited in a separate bank account that would be used only for developing and maintaining the monument.” They will have “semi-commercial activities” at the Red Fort, so are we looking at revenue generation of over Rs 10 crore a year? Will they put back this entire amount into the fort’s maintenance? If that is the case, any heritage organisation could have done the same, and in fact looked after the fort as a beloved heritage and not just a money-making venture. So, we await clarity and transparency till the exact terms of the Dalmia Bharat group and ministry of tourism contract are released. Let us now examine the second cause for concern: As per the    : “Two aspects of the Red Fort’s adoption deal stand out from all other aspects. Firstly, the government has promised the Dalmia Bharat Group that it would be held “harmless” in case the Archaeological Survey of India and others like Delhi’s district collector decide to pursue any claims related to the work done on the monument. While the indemnity clause may help against pressure tactics and frivolous activism of the “culture brigade”, it also gives creative freedom for transforming the Red Fort.” Secondly, the contract also allows prominent visibility to the  brand.” Let us take the indemnity clause, which, as per the Ministry of Tourism document quoted above, says: “First, Second and Third party will identify and hold harmless ......... Fourth party (company/Trust and its officers and employees), against any loss, costs and expenses of any third party claims which the latter may suffer as the result of any claims or proceedings brought against them arising from work performed in accordance with the scope of work and performance of this understanding.” To clear prevailing confusion, the Dalmia Bharat group will not be doing any conservation work, as Aga Khan and INTACH do. It will only develop and maintain infrastructure of the tourist amenities in the Red Fort complex, and not the monument itself. However, even the maintenance of a 400-year-old monument is a delicate job. Any mistake could shake its foundation and cause it irreparable harm. So why has the Dalmia Bharat Group been indemnified of any damage that they may unwittingly incur upon our heritage? I am sure with their expert committees, they will not let any harm come to the fort, but every corporation has inbuilt accountability. Why doesn’t this corporate have inbuilt accountability in this case? The Red Fort is an integral part of our heritage. Apart from the Mughal chapter of the fort’s history, it was here that the First War of Indian Independence was started, where the British Union Jack was taken down, and the Indian Tricolor hoisted. It is from here that the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on every Independence Day. Shah Jahan’s Red Fort was called the Qila e Mubarak (the Auspicious Fort). Bahadur Shah Zafar’s Red Fort was called The QIla e Mu’alla (The exalted Fort).

417,Kaveree Bamzai,"The history of India began in 2014, so is it surprising that Google thinks   of India? I don't see why Divya Spandana is surprised. After all, our ancients knew of surrogacy, plastic surgery and of the internet much before the West. India was not forged from mass migration and all its Hindu inhabitants were directly descended from the land’s first inhabitants. And the only progress that India has seen has been since 2014, when the Era of Modi dawned.  
 
 For one era to consolidate, another has to be wiped out. And for the RSS project of Making India Great Again, the reference point has to be a remote era rather than the recent past, where its own role has been less than stellar. Hence the feverish rewriting taking place in textbooks across India – in Rajasthan, Maharana Pratap is portrayed as the  while in Maharashtra, Class VII will be taught about  or Mohammad Bin Tughlaq or even Sher Shah Suri. At the Centre, a   to make recommendations to revise textbooks. The end is to show that history began in India, and that today’s Hindu population traces direct lineage to the land’s first inhabitants – an idea that was anathema to Jawaharlal Nehru, who insisted that Indian culture was more than just Hindu culture. This also explains why Prime Minister Modi has to constantly attack Nehru, whether it was in November in the run-up to Gujarat elections (  “If there was no Sardar Patel, the temple in Somnath would not have been possible. Some people are remembering Somnath today and I have to ask them – have you forgotten history? Your parnana (great grandfather), our first Prime Minister, was not happy with the idea of a temple being built there”), or most recently in   when he said “all of Kashmir would have been India’s if Patel had been allowed to become India’s first prime minister”. It's a different matter that Patel had little interest in Kashmir and that he died in 1950. It is also evident in their support for the family of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, who around his death – including Nehru sanctioning spies who would keep a watch on them. In order to complete the obliteration of Nehru, his contemporaries have to be elevated. Also Modi has to become him, from his celebration of India's scientific temper to his public emphasis on cooperative federalism. Hence also Modi's very public conquest of the West and his calibrated embraces. The West is, after all, the site of Nehru’s ideological education. It is also the site of his many diplomatic victories, whether it was the Non Aligned Movement, or India's role in the Commonwealth. It is no surprise that Modi has retraced the footsteps of Nehru, including most recently, in going to Wuhan and being Bhai-Bhai with the Chinese.  Modi is not alone in his dislike of Nehru. The RSS shares his deep hatred of India's first prime minister, seeing him as single handedly responsible for establishing our syncretic culture. If Nehru is erased from history, it allows them to foist their version of Indian triumphalism. Everything changes. The Nehru achkan becomes the Modi jacket; the rose in the buttonhole becomes the pocket square; and the Nehru prose becomes the Modi slogans.  There’s even a psychological theory for this – in 1971, William Irvin Thompson, a professor at York University in Toronto, wrote an op-ed in     titled “ ,” describing the way in which “thoughts can become inverted when they are reflected in actions”. This is popularly known as you-spot-it-you-got-it. So I guess Divya Spandana is wrong and Google, as always, is right.",2018-04-26,"Jawaharlal Nehru,Rewriting history,Google,Narendra Modi",Why the surprise?

418,Pathikrit Sanyal,"Self-styled godman Asaram Bapu getting   on April 25 for raping a 16-year-old in 2013 evoked many reactions. On Twitter, many, including the official handle of Congress party, began to share pictures and videos of all the statesmen and celebrities who have sought the patronage of the spiritual leader over the course of the years. Among them, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the most prominent, along with former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The implication was that a man is known by the company he keeps. One particular minute-long video shows Modi, then Gujarat chief minister, addressing a gathering: ""I have been lucky enough to seek Bapu's [Asaram] blessings from times when none knew him"". The clip also shows Asaram going on to hug a visibly younger looking Modi. People circulated the video and alleged that Narendra Modi, the former chief minister of Gujarat, the state where Asaram he founded his famous and sprawling ashram, had strong connections with the tainted guru. Bollywood actor Farhan Akhtar took to social media to call out the hypocrisy. Akhtar  , “So, Asaram is a child rapist. And he has been found guilty. Good. But can people please stop sharing images of him with PM Modi. Patronising him before he was exposed to be a pervert is no crime. Let’s be fair and give him the benefit of doubt that he, like us, did not know.” 
 
 Congress, however, completely overlooked the fact that Modi had   party members in 2013 — when Asaram was accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl — not to defend the baba and betray any allegiances. Even before the arrest, it was clear that relations were strained between the two. In September, 2012 Asaram issued a   to the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government cautioning it against targeting him and his son Narayan Sai in a case related to the mysterious death of two male disciples. In a public address, Asaram warned the then CM Modi, by saying, ""If you try to suppress us more, we will throw you out [of power]"". In fact, in 2008, it was the   that had ordered a Commission of Inquiry after two boys went missing from Asaram's ashram in Gujarat’s Motera.  Those who took on Modi and Vajpayee and a bouquet of BJP veteran leaders, failed to acknowledge that Congress' Digvijaya Singh, Kamal Nath and Motilal Vora have all also been seen   the godman’s blessing in the past. In fact, Congress leader  , who had criticised the BJP on the Asaram Bapu issue, in 2013, about protecting fake godmen, seemed to have forgotten that in Madhya Pradesh, he as CM of the state had   Asaram prime land in 1998. That is not to say that BJP members have not shown their support for the now-convicted child rapist. Uma Bharti, the Union minister for drinking water and sanitation,   in 2013 that rape charge against Asaram could be a ""politically motivated"". Even Prabhat Jha, a member of Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh, had  in 2013, ""Rape charges against Asaram Bapu is a well-planned Congress conspiracy.""  Both parties should wake up and realised that the godman was patronised equally by them. After all, they saw the advantage of having a cult leader who swayed millions by their side. The same was true for Dera Sacha Sauda head   — now sitting in prison for  two of his followers more than 15 years ago — who was courted by both the parties for endless means. Ahead of Haryana Assembly elections, the BJP in-charge of the state Kailash Vijayvargiya took as many as 44 candidates to the Dera Sacha Sauda seeking blessings of Ram Rahim.

419,M Reyaz,"Senior Congress leader and former Union minister Salman Khurshid found himself in a controversy on Tuesday, April 24, after a report quoted him  , ""Congress' hands are stained with the blood of Muslims."" The statement was reportedly made in response to a question by a student at Aligarh Muslim University. The student reportedly asked why minorities should trust Congress despite series of communal riots, including Hashimpura, and the demolition of the Babri Masjid, all of which happened under the Congress rule. While responding to the ""political question"", Khurshid rhetorically said, ""You are telling us that if someone attacks you now, then we [Congress] must not come forward to protect you. I am telling you this: We are ready to show the blood on our hands so that you understand that you too must not gets blood on your hands."" He continued, ""If you attack a community, you are the one who get stains on your hands. Learn something from our history and don't create such a situation for yourself, where if you come back to AMU after 10 years you will find someone like yourself who will ask this kind of question."" At a time when the grand old party is trying to revive itself under new president Rahul Gandhi the remark   with the rank and file of Congress. The party quickly distanced itself from Khurshid's statement. Khurshid, too, clarified that he did so ""to drive home a point that even if we [Congress] have some bloodstains on our clothes or if we have committed some mistakes, we still have the right to stand up for minorities."" He also tweeted his   over media's ""sensationalism for profit"". Khurshid who has served in the past as minister of external affairs, law as well as minority affairs is interestingly in news for the second time in the last one week. He earlier made headlines when he expressed his disagreement with the proposal to impeach chief justice of India Dipak Misra, along with Ashwani Kumar, another former law minister of the UPA regime. The disagreement was registered despite the fact that the impeachment motion had Rahul Gandhi's approval. He has gone on record to say that he was   on the impeachment matter. There are speculations that this is part of Khurshid's power posturing within the party as Rahul Gandhi is in the process of putting his own team in place. Whether Khurshid meant it as an acknowledgement of ""bloodstains"" on the Congress' hands, or it was a rhetorical remark, the fact remains that the Congress party indeed cannot disown its past. One can very well argue that the Hindutva organisations have put in place what Paul Brass called the ""institutionalised riot system"". But the Congress always appeared reluctant to take action against erring police officials, who were complicit in riots as actual perpetrators. or by its inaction. There has rarely been any prosecution in major riot cases from Nellie (1983) to Hashimpura (1987). The most glaring example is the demolition of the Babri Masjid and riots that followed in Mumbai and other parts of the country. Who can forget the role of Jagdish Tytler, Sajjan Kumar and other Congress cadres in the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom. Historian Mukul Kesavan had aptly noted, ""The Congress, by a kind of historical default, is a pluralist party that is opportunistically communal while the BJP is an ideologically communal (or majoritarian) party that is opportunistically 'secular'."" In the wake of the recent series of attacks on Dalits and their icons, several SC/ST leaders of the BJP and their allies publicly spoke against an atmosphere of fear being created by some. However, you would rarely see so-called Muslim leaders of the purported secular parties take a stand unless they decide to jump to the other side of the fence. Most of them have little mass base of their own and are chosen because of their pedigree and/or loyalties to the party high command. Often derided as sarkari Musalman, Muslim leaders of the Congress and other so-called secular parties buy privileges for themselves at the cost of the Muslim community they claim to represent. When Babri Masjid was demolished, three Muslims were ministers in the PV Narasimha Rao cabinet - CK Jaffer Sharief, Ghulam Nabi Azad and (surprise) Khurshid - then MoS in the external affairs ministry. In fact, Azad who was then parliamentary affairs minister was given charge of two ministries - civil aviation and tourism - in January 1993. Ironically, only the Congress leader to then resign from the party, MJ Akbar, is now a minister in the NDA government. Similarly, Azam Khan, the Muslim face and strong leader of the Samajwadi Party was a powerful minister in the Akhilesh Yadav Cabinet when 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots took place. In fact, the Uttar Pradesh Assembly had 69 Muslim MLAs, including 43 from SP alone, but we did not hear any strong voice of resentment from them. Khurshid's Delhi residence is in Jamia Nagar, but he had not bothered to address and placate local residents after the Batla House police shootout, when palpable fear of being seen as suspects had turned the whole locality schizophrenic, eloquently expressed in a new memoir,   by journalist Neyaz Farooquee. In 2012, however, he had suddenly remembered at a poll rally in Azamgarh that Sonia Gandhi had ""bitterly wept"" after seeing photographs of the deceased. He claimed then that he had taken a delegation to Sonia, but had said nothing on record. So while we may be outraged over the acquittal of Maya Kodnani, the fact is, she and some others were at least convicted by lower courts in the 2002 Gujarat riots. They spent a few years in jails, although most of them now appear to be getting away. But the BJP government is only following its predecessors - albeit unabashedly. Otherwise a very talented counsel and a thorough gentleman, Khurshid is a perfect example of liberal-elite sarkari Musalman, disconnected from the community. Someone who is more comfortable in liberal circles in Delhi or London than among their poor cousins. At his constituency in Farrukhabad, during the 2014 elections, many people had apparently asked, ""You make Farrukhabad proud the world over [as foreign minister], but what do we get from it?"" He had clearly failed to fulfil the aspirations of people of his constituency. Even his supporters and family loyalists alleged that they rarely saw him or anyone from the family visit the constituency during his five years' tenure. After serving as MP for two terms and minister, in 2014, he promised the voters to set up an international standard centre for embroidery where latest technology would be used that would not only help the craftsmen there but also help bring Farrukhabad on the map of tourism. It is precisely because of this kind of double-speak that Muslims in the country continue to suffer. It is what makes sankari Muslamans responsible for making secularism a curse word and allows the BJP to dismiss it as ""Muslim appeasement"".",2018-04-26,"Hashimpura,Minority appeasement,Congress,Salman Khurshid",Blood of Muslims on its hands?

420,Praveen Shekhar,"Political temperatures in Karnataka are rising with Assembly polls less than 20 days away. All political parties are campaigning with full vigour as election day, May 12, closes in. The vigour of the campaigning notwithstanding, Karnataka is  , according to various opinion polls. While, the   is seen to be emerging as the largest party with 90 to 95 seats, it will be far away from the majority figures in the 224-seat Assembly. The main Opposition - BJP - could get away with 85 to 90 seats, and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda's party Janata Dal Secular could land third with 35-40 seats. If such a situation emerges on May 15, the day of election results, then Deve Gowda will be the happiest man. His political bargaining power will skyrocket because without the support of his party, neither the Congress nor the BJP will be able to form the government. Karnataka has a long history of hung assemblies. Deve Gowda's party JDS had already been in coalition with both the parties - Congress and BJP. Therefore, Gowda should not have any qualms in shaking hands and teaming up with any of these parties one again. But the problems for JDS are closer home. While former prime minister HD Deve Gowda may be inclined to team up with the Congress, his son and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy is learnt to be inclined more towards the BJP. In 2004, Deve Gowda had supported the Congress and helped form the Dharam Singh-led Congress government. But two years later, in 2006, Gowda's son Kumaraswamy severed ties with the Congress and formed his own government with the support of the BJP. However, his government too fell after one year. Over the years, Deve Gowda has established a secular image for himself. He is trying to win big in this election on the back of his secular credentials. Gowda is considered to be the tallest leader of the Vokkaliga community, which constitutes around 12 per cent of the population in the state. This time, he has   with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati. The population of Dalits in the state is 20 around per cent. Deve Gowda hopes that this JDS-BSP coalition will benefit from the current perception of an anti-Dalit environment existing in the country. Apart from this, there is a belief in the party that the secular image of the JDS-BSP combine will help them garner minority votes. However, Deve Gowda's dream of becoming the kingmaker may not be that easy. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has created difficulties for Gowda- Kumaraswamy in winning the support of the Muslim electorate. Owaisi is camping in Karnataka to garner Muslim votes. But that's not the only problem. Mayawati, who had raised high hopes for JDS wooing the Dalits, has almost gone into oblivion since the alliance was struck. While repeating a 1994 kind of victory is difficult for the JDS, which won 113 out of the 224 seats, is impossible, Deve Gowda also has to fight to save his credibility as a significant leader in Karnataka politics. At the moment, it's a ""do-or-die"" situation for him.",2018-04-24,"Congress,BJP,Deve Gowda,Karnataka elections",Why Karnataka elections are a do-or-die for Deve Gowda,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-elections-deve-gowda-bjp-congress-jds-assembly-elections-vokkaligas-mayawati/story/1/23677.html
421,Affan Yesvi,"On the diplomatic reset with China, the Narendra Modi government seems to have acknowledged the TINA factor to dialogue - There Is No Alternative. The people of Kashmir wish New Delhi shows the same sagacity where the beleaguered Valley is concerned. The recent announcement that Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) has   from Meghalaya after 27 years and further restricted in Arunachal Pradesh has become a point of heated discussion in Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir has been under the imposition of AFSPA for nearly three decades now. Given the insurgency and the political turbulence, Kashmir has borne the brunt of AFSPA. Kashmiris acknowledge that the current scenario in the Valley is disturbed. Kashmiris are also aware that if the only way forward is peace, then concrete steps must be taken by New Delhi to build the atmosphere where peace is possible. The tweet of senior PDP minister Naeem Akhtar succinctly captures the sentiment in the Valley. On April 23, after the news fregarding   withdrawal in parts of the Northeast flashed, Aktar tweeted: 
 
 
 
It is remarkable that in a single tweet, Akhtar sent out a strong message to the people of Kashmir, to New Delhi and to Pakistan as well - Our neighbours have to realise and help in this effort. The admission for Kashmir: ""We all need to work for creating conditions conducive to its revocation in J&K."" In a conflict as complex and multi-layered as the one going on in Kashmir, it will be too simplistic to assume that New Delhi can take any positive initiative till the ground situation improves. The message for New Delhi: No state can permanently be governed through emergency laws in a democracy. Kashmiris are bitter that in the years of relative peace and low insurgency in the Valley from 2011 to 2016, the government wasted valuable time in taking any bold initiative on Kashmir. The rule of the Army stayed, along with the heavy presence of the security forces all over the Valley. Today, many Kashmiris are sad to admit that given the law and order situation on the ground, New Delhi may not even consider a phased withdrawal of AFSPA. For the average Kashmiri trying to survive amid the bloody conflict, the omnipresent soldier, the constant cordons and searches translate into loss of dignity on a daily basis. Sporadically, over the last decade, Kashmir has seen intense turbulence in which school and college students too participated. For nearly two years now, the agitation against the state by students has acquired alarming proportions, in the form of stone-pelting and street protests. While palliative measures may be taken, the moot point remains that this is a generation that has grown up in a heavily militarised environment. Heavy armour vehicles and guns are a constant in their lives. How can these children be expected to grow up as responsible citizens of a responsible republic? A social consciousness must arise in Kashmir that the people here are prime stakeholders, and have to take on the responsibility of rebuilding peace here. In return, the government must take steps to remove AFSPA from Kashmir in gradual steps. As an initial confidence building measure, heavy security build-up should be phased out from the heavily populated locales of the urban centres. The Kashmiris yearn for a life of peace and dignity. If the government reposes faith in the people, and gives them the peace and dignity they crave for, the dividends will be seen in the years to come.",2018-04-24,"Stone pelting,Naeem Akhtar,AFSPA in Meghalaya,Kashmir Issue",Why removal of AFSPA from parts of Northeast has become a talking point in Kashmir,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/afspa-kashmir-issue-afspa-in-meghalaya-naeem-akhtar-stone-pelting-pakistan/story/1/23688.html
422,Anusha Soni,"The Opposition parties have presented   to justify the impeachment motion against chief justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra by laying out incidents of ""misconduct"" on part of Misra. The allegations range from his involvement in the   to administrative impropriety. As vice-president Venkaiah Naidu has rejected the motion, the matter is all set to rock the Supreme Court. In the past few months, I have been   of the way in which the   is administered. With each passing day, the need and cry for reform has only grown louder. But the present impeachment motion seems to suggest that CJI Dipak Misra is the root of everything that is currently wrong with the Supreme Court. It's a deeply misleading and absolutely incorrect picture. I shall elaborate on two arguments to establish that the attack on the CJI is purely a political move and will end up harming the judiciary. First, the present move of the Opposition parties to seek the impeachment motion is a very low attempt to harp political benefits out of the systemic issues that plague the Supreme Court. By ""low"" I mean that it's purely for partisan reasons and doesn't address the problems that it claims to which are primarily institutional in nature. Much worse, it attempts to score political points at the altar of a troubled judiciary. It is difficult to believe that the Opposition, armed with battery of top lawyers, didn't expect that the chairman of Rajya Sabha, Naidu in this case, may refuse to admit the motion. Even if the motion was allowed to go through, the Opposition doesn't have the numbers in Parliament to sustain it. The attempt has been to insist that the CJI steps down either for legal or for larger propriety reasons. When the Opposition moves SC, it will end up creating a constitutionally precarious situation because the CJI cannot deal with the matter and the top four judges have already been vocal about their disagreements with the CJI. There would also be questions about who will exercise administrative powers to allocate the case since CJI is the sole ""master of roster"". Let's deal with the medical admissions scam case. Even the worst critics of CJI Dipak Misra shall concede that there is absolutely no evidence against him in the Prasad Educational Trust case. He did not pass any orders that favoured the college in question. The call intercepts prove nothing. The   while Misra practised as a lawyer was a ground that could have been considered only when he was elevated to judgeship, this can't be a ground for impeachment. As far as exercise of his administrative powers is concerned, one wonders how Opposition parties reached the conclusion that a back dated administrative note was prepared. What evidence do they have? Also it's not that no other CJI in the past has faced such allegations of corruption. Former CJI KG Balakrishnan faced  . The most recent in the league of cases is the   written by late chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Kalikho Pul, which named former CJI JS Khehar and other judges for seeking bribe through their relatives. Let's now come to administrative impropriety. Recently justice Jasti Chelameswar conceded that selective assignment of cases is not new in Supreme Court. He even went on to concede that Jayalalithaa's disproportionate assets case was selectively assigned and that didn't happen during the tenure of CJI Dipak Misra but during the tenure of former CJI HL Dattu, who is now the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission. My second argument is that the current issues that plague the judiciary are purely institutional in nature. CJI Dipak Misra hasn't exercised his powers any worse than his predecessors. But he has indeed failed as an administrator in managing the power equations within the Supreme Court, which his predecessors managed rather better. Beyond this, to my mind, he is being used as a shield in political cross-firings. He happens to be the CJI at a point when the voices within the judiciary are screaming for reforms. It can be argued that CJI Misra has failed to win the confidence of his fellow judges and on the administrative side, there has been greater concentration of power. However, to say that the present problems of Supreme Court are only about one judge is a misleading political project. The problem is not of a personality but of the institution and the lack of transparent processes. It's time the apex court stands up to the political assault and protect the institution by undertaking internal reforms. Any face-saving attempt shall only make the situation worse.",2018-04-24,"Judicial crisis,Chief Justice of India,Dipak Misra,Impeachment motion",Why I think impeachment motion against CJI Dipak Misra is politics at its lowest,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/impeachment-motion-dipak-misra-chief-justice-of-india-judicial-crisis-congress/story/1/23683.html
423,Harsha Kakar,"The government last week announced the  , termed as the Defence Planning Committee (DPC), under the chairmanship of the National Security Advisor (NSA), Ajit Doval. This is to be a permanent body and will have as its members the chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (presently also a service chief), other service chiefs, the foreign secretary, the defence secretary and the expenditure secretary of the finance ministry. The member secretary would be the Chief of the Integrated Defence Staff (CISC). The DPC, as per the press release, is slated to prepare a draft national security strategy, undertake a strategic defence review, and formulate an international defence engagement strategy. The idea behind its creation is to establish a mechanism that can undertake integrated planning, to enable the forces to meet challenges in the emerging complex international security environment. As per the government order, the committee would have four sub-committees. These are policy and strategy, plans and capability development, defence diplomacy, and defence manufacturing ecosystem. The details of the members of each committee and its terms of reference would be announced later. The inputs generated by these committees would be pursued by the defence minister. Thus, while the organisation falls under the purview of the PMO, as the NSC is a part of it and the NSA advises the PM, the processing would be done by the defence minister. The plausible reason for placing it under the PMO is to draw in members from other ministries, which may not have worked as willingly under the MoD. India needed an overhaul in its “apex management of defence”. The basic role of “management of defence” implies developing national security objectives and strategy from national aims and interests, long-term military strategy and objectives as also evolving planning guidelines for developing military capability. It also involves implementing, monitoring and controlling military strategy and force development. Such a responsibility would involve the NSC, MoD and service headquarters. In that manner, the organisation and chain of processing is beneficial. National power flows from a combination of factors economic, diplomatic and military. Thus, the DPC has a combination of senior military members and bureaucrats from the economic and foreign ministries. It enables the government to avoid remodelling the NSC, which is presently IB and RAW (IPS cadre) dominated and lacks suitable representatives from other elements of power. Further, in creating this committee, the government has once again appointed a pseudo Chief of Defence staff (CDS) in the form of the NSA. He would now be responsible for coordinating, approving and determining major procurements, defence engagement, deployment at the macro level and budgetary demands between the three services based on emerging threat perceptions. Earlier, these delved on the defence secretary and the defence minister, leading to heartburns due to their lack of understanding military matters. It gives the government another excuse to avoid and delay appointing a CDS. The issue of avoiding appointing a CDS is further highlighted by appointing the CISC as the member secretary. The CISC heads HQ Integrated Defence Staff, which is earmarked for formulating a joint military strategy, force development and coordinating force procurement based on priorities determined by emerging threats. It has been unable to perform its assigned task because of non-appointment of a CDS, thus compelling all services to process their cases directly with the MoD. By placing the CISC in the DPC, enables the NSA to function as a pseudo CDS. Thus, control of the armed forces shifts from the defence minister to the PMO, with the NSA officiating as the CDS. There would, however, be advantages in this system. Firstly, all elements involved in projection of national power would remain under one roof. Hence, based on the nature of threat, a coordinated approach would emerge, employing each element to its full capacity. Secondly, India desperately requires the creation of a national security strategy, which could then be the policy document for countering emerging threats. Lack of such guidelines implies each ministry rumbles on in isolation. Thirdly, military engagement also implies military diplomacy and international military cooperation. It is essential in the current environment. Military diplomacy is more pronounced in nations where political uncertainty exists. While the military in these nations remains away from politics, it continues to exert power from behind the throne. Most nations in our close and extended neighbourhood, up to Africa, are falling into the Chinese debt trap, forced to surrender strategic assets. This is because governments tend to view short-term gains by accepting loans, which result in long-term repayment issues. It is here that quiet military diplomacy would pay greater dividends than diplomacy, as military to military contacts would advise on alternate options, where loss of strategic assets is avoided. Further, the military would remain, while governments would continue to change. Accepting the growing importance of military diplomacy should be accepted and implemented by the DPC. Fourthly, the world seeks to engage militarily with India. Decisions taken on the nature and level of engagement are done without consulting the armed forces, which could lead to misinterpretation. Hence, this body is an ideal institution to firm international military cooperation and coordination. Fifth is the availability of funds for enhancing defence preparedness. Closer interaction among the senior hierarchy at functional and decision-making levels of major ministries would enhance awareness of force capability and development requirements, which may benefit in release of adequate funds the long term.  Finally, and most importantly, the NSA implies the direct involvement of the PMO in immediate matters pertaining to national security and force enhancement. This could be effective if the NSA, convinced by arguments on force shortcomings, is able to open closed doors and ensure release of adequate funds. The system may work only if all involved move forward in a coordinated manner and the organisation meets at frequent intervals. If it functions akin to the Strategic Planning Group of the NSC, whose meetings are less than infrequent, then this would result in the creation of an additional elephant in government functioning. If the aim is to make the NSA a pseudo CDS, then this organisation is doomed to add to problems in the years ahead. National security has been largely ignored as respective ministers work in closed spaces, as the present budget has indicated. If this organisation can break those shackles and work to enhance defence preparedness based on realistic assessment of threat, only then would it be a worthwhile exercise.    ",2018-04-22,"PMO,Indian Army,NSA Ajit Doval,Defence Planning Committee",What government setting panel headed by Ajit Doval for defence planning means for armed forces,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/defence-planning-committee-nsa-ajit-doval-defence-forces-army-pmo/story/1/23630.html
424,Madhuri Danthala,"In 1991, women in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, began an agitation against arrack — a distilled alcoholic drink — after a few men had died, consuming spurious liquor. The popular Telugu newspaper  , extended support to the cause and even stated a column called “ , (war on liquor)”. Soon it was made an election issue by the TDP, (as anyone familiar with Andhra politics is aware,   leans towards TDP, with many even calling it the unofficial mouthpiece). The TDP came to power and implemented a total prohibition. The policy of prohibition wasn’t entirely noble as it impacted M Subbarami Reddy, a liquor baron and Congress leader who also ran the paper  , which offered the counterview of  . Soon   closed down, and the policy of prohibition was done away with. Currently, Andhra Pradesh has the dubious distinction of being the highest consumer of liquor and the media isn’t bothered about alcoholism in the state anymore. Clearly, the media had ulterior political motives and hijacked a noble cause. Even today, it appears to be applying the same formula to discredit the government’s opponents as can be ascertained from the debate over sexual harassment triggered off by actor Sri Reddy. Rather than help women seek justice, the media has obfuscated the cause and adroitly put the focus on actor-politician Pawan Kalyan, the founder of Jana Sena Party. When asked by the media to comment, Kalyan had said that rather than debating in TV studios,   must file a case and seek justice in the courts. Sri Reddy lashed out at Kalyan on TV and called him a “mad**ch*d” followed by the obscene gesture of showing her finger. She was miffed that Kalyan told her to visit a police station to seek justice. The media played the clip ad nauseum which seems to have caused deep anguish to the actor’s mother. Kalyan’s brother Naga Babu held a press conference and admonished Sri Reddy. During the conference, the otherwise jovial actor who hosts a comedy show broke down. The media should have shown more sensitivity and focused on sexual harassment, a problem not confined to the tinsel town. It however sensationalised it and cast aspersions on women who work in the film industry. In a dramatic turn of events, a leaked audio clip of Sri Reddy on the phone with actor Tamanna, found its way to the media. She claimed that famous director Ram Gopal Varma instigated her to attack Pawan Kalyan so that she gets more attention. Varma posted a video on the social media confessing that it was indeed he who ""advised"" Sri Reddy to abuse Pawan Kalyan so that she gains the spotlight. He went on to bizarrely explain that the word used by Sri Reddy should not be taken seriously, because it was used in a recent Telugu movie,   and that movie was a box office hit. All this needs to be seen in the context of a concerted effort to malign Pawan Kalyan by the powers-that-be, using the media. Kathi Mahesh, an obscure film critic suddenly shot to fame due to his comments against Kalyan. It is interesting to note the interest with which the media gave him space in prime time as he studio hopped attacking Kalyan with acerbic personal comments, which had little to do with his films. He claimed (like Sri Reddy) that Kalyan’s fans have abused him on social media. It is not fair to hold a leader responsible for the actions of self-claimed fans, if the leader in question doesn’t actively encourage or tacitly support them. There has been no evidence of Kalyan indulging in such behaviour. On the contrary, the media was largely silent when in 2015, TDP leaders “graced” an event where a speaker advocated that people of a particular caste must not donate blood, lest their “purity be lost”. The speaker was taking a jibe at Kalyan’s brother and Congress leader Chiranjeevi who advocates blood and eye donation and runs a successful blood bank. None of the leaders present was even reprimanded by the TDP. As they had done in 1991, the media hijacked the debate around a serious problem and used it to slander those perceived to be a threat to the government.   It appears that the present controversy over Kalyan was whipped up to serve two purposes. The first is to malign him as he enjoys immense support amongst the public — which the TDP banked on in 2014 to come to power, as he had endorsed the NDA. The second is to digress from the failures of the government and the many unkept promises, which people, especially Kalyan had begun to question. It must be remembered that the TDP government is the only one that has officially ""employed journalists"" and outsourced its PR work to them. It is sad that rather than cover news, the media is covering up the news, taking “yellow” journalism to its nadir.

426,Amarnath K Menon,"The special court of National Investigation Agency   — that all accused in the bombing at the iconic Mecca Masjid be set free for want of evidence — is stunning for police, intelligence and security agencies that were supposed to bust terror plots and communal conflagration. While nine died and 58 were injured at the historic mosque, where the Nizams of Hyderabad lay interred, another  in a police firing after the incident. Consequent to the uproar, within weeks, on June 2, 2007, the YS Rajasekhara Reddy government appointed a one-man commission of retired high court judge V Bhaskar Rao to investigate the police firing. Despite accusations of police excesses, the government has not disclosed the findings of the inquiry commission, submitted in October 2010. Now, to add to that mystery, K Ravinder Reddy, the fourth additional metropolitan sessions judge, Hyderabad, has concluded that adequate evidence against any of the accused is not available and virtually put a lid on the case. On the other hand, the Mecca Masjid blast probe moved from a Special Investigation Team of the Hyderabad Police, to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and finally to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) without bringing the offenders to book. The Mecca Masjid terror narrative has gone through dramatic twists and turns at each stage. It started as a cross-border Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJi) conspiracy in the hands of the Hyderabad police. Five HuJi suspects allegedly confessed to have carried out the terror strike with RDX supplied from associates in Bangladesh. Now, it has reached a dead end. No wonder, those who lost their loved ones at Mecca Masjid and in the violence that followed, feel terribly let down by law enforcing authorities and the state. The NIA says it will examine Ravinder Reddy’s judgment and decide the future course of action. But it fails to raise hopes. Aseemanand, first arrested by the CBI in the case in 2010 before it was transferred to the NIA, was acquitted along with six others in the case of the 2007 Ajmer Dargah blast that killed three and injured 17. The NIA has not challenged those acquittals. Aseemanand and five others are still facing trial in another 2007 case — the Samjhauta Express blast where 68 people, mostly Pakistanis, were killed while the train was on its way to Lahore from Delhi. After the CBI arrested Aseemanand and the other accused in the Ajmer Dargah case in 2010, they became accused in the Mecca Masjid case too “as persons affiliated to various Hindu religious outfits (seemed) to have planned and executed blasts to avenge terror strikes on temples.” There was not much headway in establishing links and the case was handed over to NIA in April 2011. The body followed the CBI’s line of investigation without discovering adequate material that is clinching to impress and convince the court. Either the CBI or NIA, or both, have apparently botched the probe and the prosecution. NIA sources have disclosed in anonymity that investigators did not brief the 226 witnesses properly, prompting 66 of them to turn hostile. The NIA did not go in for an appeal when Aseemanand and another accused, Bharat Bhai, were granted bail in March 2017 and, thereafter, transferred a principal investigator back to the Uttar Pradesh cadre abruptly before she completed her five-year tenure in Hyderabad. All this happened after the Hyderabad police chasing the HuJi narrative rounded up more than 125 Muslim youth and faced allegations of excesses. “Our fight against terrorism is weakened after these acquittals,” laments All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi,   “It was a biased investigation by a deaf and blind parrot.” Judge Ravinder Reddy has only heightened these apprehensions by  , hours after announcing the verdict, to fuel speculation that he was quitting under pressure. Vote-bank politics is apparently gaining the upper hand at a time when the state is bound to respond to relatives of victims over its failure to ensure justice.

427,Tridivesh Singh Maini,"The  , was held in Beijing at an interesting time. In the past few months, both India and China, despite their deep divergences on strategic and economic issues, and the strains caused as a consequence of the Doklam standoff in 2017, are trying to put relations back on track by increasing the level of engagement at the governmental level. Significantly, this dialogue, the first after the   -which led to the freezing of dialogue between the two countries in 2017 - was held days after the Boao Forum, where Chinese President and leader for life, Xi Jinping, made an interesting address articulating his vision on a myriad of important, but complex issues, such as globalisation, and geopolitics, especially the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). At the dialogue, India was represented by Rajiv Kumar, vice chairman Niti (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, while China was represented by He Lifeng, chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Apart from bilateral issues - trade, investment, infrastructural cooperation and economic connectivity - the trade dispute between US and China, and possible impact, including opportunities, for India-China relations, also figured in the discussions. On the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington DC, India was unequivocal, that it would remain neutral in the dispute. India did suggest to China, that it should consider and sugar from India. China's imports of agricultural commodities, from the US, are to the tune of $20 billion. For long, both sides have also been discussing the possibility of China setting up special clusters in India. During the dialogue, this issue was discussed again, with the Indian delegation stating that there is great scope for China to set up special clusters in areas such as textiles, food processing, electronic components and pharmaceuticals. It may be pertinent to point out that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was first signed in June 2014 between Indian state governments of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana and Chinese agencies) for the setting up of  . So far, not much has been achieved. In the area of infrastructure, cooperation was sought to be explored in the area of railways (specifically for increasing the speed of the Chennai-Bangalore railway corridor, and upgradation of Agra-Jhansi railway stations). India also invited China to invest in the Housing for all program by 2022. On issues like BRI, differences between both sides persisted, with China stating that Bangladesh China India and Myanmar (BCIM) Corridor was one of the important corridors of the BRI. New Delhi disagreed, and stated that the BCIM project began way before the idea of BRI was conceived. India also stated that at this point of time, India was more focused on projects such as the Asean trilateral highway project (India-Myanmar-Thailand), which would boost its ""Act East Policy"". Even on India's concerns with regard to CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor), there was no real progress with China not paying enough attention to India's concerns, that CPEC passes through disputed territory and it is a major sovereignty issue. After the Chinese president's speech at the Boao Forum, some in India had believed that China may be more sensitive to addressing India's concerns on BRI. Commenting on the BRI, President Xi said: ""China has no geopolitical calculations, seeks no exclusionary blocs and imposes no business deals on others."" Interestingly, China did take note of India's Act East Policy and infrastructural projects being upgraded in India's North Eastern Region. The issue of ""soft power"" also came up during the discussions with India suggesting that in addition to the current working groups, and additional one be set up on culture. Of late, Indian movies have been doing very well in China, with the latest success being  , whose box-office collection was nearing Rs 200 crore as of April 14. Earlier movies like   (Rs 450 crore) and   (Rs 300 crore) had won Chinese heart. Indian film star  , also one of the producers of both   and   has a large number of fans on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging website, and has also expressed interest in working with Chinese actors. Even strained ties between both countries have not been an obstacle to the success of Hindi movies in China. In fact, the success of Bollywood movies in China receives extensive coverage in Chinese media. Amid US president's insular economic policies, and intransigence on issues pertaining to climate change, there is space for India and China to cooperate. For any meaningful progress, however, a few steps need to be taken: China needs to genuinely address Indian concerns on BRI. Indian ambassador to China, Gautam Bambawale, in an interview to  , while commenting on India's apprehensions had said: ""If a project meets those norms, we will be happy to take part in it. One of the norms is the project should not violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country. Unfortunately, there is this thing called CPEC, which is called a flagship project of BRI, which violates India's sovereignty and territory integrity. Therefore, we oppose it,"" At the same time, New Delhi should also have a more pragmatic vision towards BRI. While New Delhi should not give up its stance on the ""sovereignty issue"", synergies should not be ruled out, New Delhi should be open to the BCIM corridor, which seeks to connect Kunming in China to Kolkata in India. While New Delhi is working jointly with Japan in projects like the   and even countries in the Indo-Pacific have spoken in terms of strengthening connectivity projects, New Delhi should look at all options. If Japan and China are willing to work jointly on connectivity projects, (during a meeting between foreign ministers of both countries in Tokyo, this issue was discussed) both, there is no reason why New Delhi should be totally closed to the BRI. Considering the fact, that China is planning to extend CPEC till Afghanistan, New Delhi cannot afford to be excessively rigid to participating in the project. Second, in areas like investments, infrastructure and agriculture, it is important to get Indian state governments and Chinese provinces onboard by rotation. The Fourth Strategic Dialogue in October 2016, where India was represented by then vice chairman of Niti Aayog, Arvind Panagariya and China, by Xu Shaoshi, chairman of National Development and Reform Commission, People's Republic of China witnessed the participation of India's Coastal Provinces and presentations by them on possible investment opportunities. It was also decided that greater cooperation between both sides in manufacturing is needed. The minutes of the Dialogue are as follows: ""... representatives of different states, viz., Gujarat, Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and CEO, Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Ltd. made presentations in the Working Group… The State Government representatives gave presentations on the opportunities in the above sector in the coastal regions of India… Mr Li Xuedong (Deputy Director General NDRC) stressed that the Statement of principles on Manufacturing and Industrial Capacity between NDRC, China and NITI Aayog, India to be signed on October 7 by two Chairmen of the 4th India China SED, would mark the good beginning of manufacturing and industrial capacity cooperation between the two sides. With active participation of Chinese local governments and Indian states…. Since in recent years, a number of states and provinces which were not pro-active in the relationship have begun to play a role in the bilateral relationship. Off late for instance, China has shown an interest in Eastern India (especially West Bengal) due to interest in the BCIM project.The Chinese side can also include provinces, like Jiangsu, which have done well in agriculture, and states like Punjab have sought to build linkages with them. While the India-China Forum of State Provincial Leaders has not been able to enhance the participation of states and provinces in the bilateral relationship to the degree possible and feasible, the Strategic and Economic Dialogue should seek to make Indian states and Chinese Provinces important stakeholders. Third, while China needs to address India's concerns and cannot afford to be dismissive of India's apprehensions, New Delhi needs to move beyond a 'security' mindset. Building a constructive economic relationship will be very tough without a degree of flexibility from both ends. If both sides are not genuinely flexible, the bilateral relationship will not move beyond platitudes and MoUs. China also needs to deliver on its commitments of investment in India. President Xi during his visit in 2014 had said that India would invest $20 billion over a five-year period, official estimates show that till last year, Chinese investments were a little over $1.5 billion. Fourth, basic issues such as a more realistic - if not relaxed - visa regime, increased connectivity, and more direct flights between both countries are essential for progress in all spheres. In conclusion, the current geopolitical and economic scenario is interesting, albeit challenging and complex, and India cannot restrict itself to anyone camp, it should try to harness opportunities, as and when they arise. It is also important for both sides to distinguish between short-term goals, and a long-term vision, which needs to be more holistic.",2018-04-19,"China,Doklam standoff,BRI,One Road One Belt",What India and China can do to build bridges,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/china-india-china-relations-one-road-one-belt-bri-doklam-standoff-china/story/1/23576.html
428,Sagarneel Sinha,"The CPI(M), the biggest Left party in the country, is busy discussing its future political course in a five-day long party congress that started on April 18 in Hyderabad. The   is taking place at a time when the CPI(M) is facing an existential crisis. The party is in power in just one state, Kerala, after the BJP ended the 25-year communist rule in Tripura. 
 
 The base of the party is continuously eroding in its erstwhile citadel West Bengal, where the BJP is filling the Opposition space against the ruling Trinamool Congress. Added to all these issues, another crucial issue is to keep the party undivided. Already, there are divisions inside the party regarding the issue of alliance with the Congress party. The current general secretary,  , supported by a large section of the Bengal brigade wants an alliance with the grand old party to defeat the BJP in the coming general elections. On the other side, Kerala brigade led by former general secretary Prakash Karat is against any sort of proximity with the Congress. According to Karat, the CPI(M) along with the other Left allies should fight the BJP from its own pockets of influence and for the rest seats it would be better to support the “strongest opposition” candidate. It seems that the five-day long party congress would be wasting all its energy discussing the issue of alliance with the Congress. The comrades have forgotten that the historic split of CPI in 1964 into two factions - pro-Congress CPI and anti-Congress CPI(M) - was also due to the differences regarding relations with the Congress party. Once again history is repeating in the CPI(M). So much so that it might lead to another split in the party. The question is: Why do comrades fight among themselves over proximity with the Congress time and again? The reason is the perception among the Leftists and their intellectual friends that the centrist Congress is much better than rightist parties like the Jana Sangh in the past, and the BJP at the present. They portray the Congress as a friend helping the “secular” communists when it is necessary. Due to this thought, communists had many times allied with the grand old party sacrificing their own base. The united CPI emerged as the largest non-Congress party in the general elections of 1952, 1957 and 1962, and even formed the first non-Congress state government in Kerala in 1957. However, Communist party's closeness with the Congress cost heavily, even dividing the party into two factions only to weaken its base and resulting in ceding the opposition space to the Swatantra party, Socialists and the Jana Sangh, the BJP's earlier incarnation. It was not enough, CPI didn't even hesitate to burn its own hands by supporting Indira Gandhi's infamous Emergency. It seems the comrades in  haven't learnt from the state's experiment of 2016 where the party allied with the Congress, even ignoring the concerns of its traditional Left allies. The outcome of the experiment was worse than a nightmare for the Leftists, where the CPI(M)-led Left Front got only 32 seats behind the Congress' tally of 45. Left’s votes contributed to the good performance of the Congress, but the latter failed to transfer its votes to the Left. Even the Congress didn't cooperate whole-heartedly with the other Left allies. Nevertheless, the comrades tend to repeat the same blunders. The party conference should rather introspect why the party couldn't cross beyond the borders of the three states - West Bengal, Tripura and Kerala. The BJP, which had failed to get elected even a single MLA in Tripura until last year, is at present ruling the state, a former bastion of the Left. The saffron party's victory in Tripura shows that everything is possible in politics. The CPI(M) has always been a leading voice on the issue of gender injustice and raising the issue of 33 per cent reservation of women in the country. Yet, the truth is that the women are neglected in the party structure. The Politburo, the second highest decision-making body of the party, has only two women members out of 16. The Central Committee, the apex decision-making body, has only 14 women out of 91 members. If the 33 per cent  criteria is implemented in the party structure, the number of women members in the Politburo will stand at five, and in the Central Committee, the number will rise to at least 30. Not only this, youth representation in the party is also very poor despite the fact that 66 per cent of the country's population is below 35. Also, the party should change its atheist perspective in a religious-minded country like India. The party's narrative of so-called “secularism in danger” has rather added a negative image of the CPI(M) among the majority Hindus. The most surprising fact is the “intellectual” comrades couldn't even formulate an “Indian model of socialism” till now. That's why it would be better for the beleaguered comrades to discuss issues of strengthening the party as opportunistic alliances would never help the party to recover its lost base. The worried comrades can take a leaf from the recent farmers' movement of Maharashtra led by party's peasant wing, Kisan Sabha, as it might offer some lessons to those engaged in brainstorming in Hyderabad.",2018-04-19,"Prakash Karat,Sitaram Yechury,Congress,CPI(M)",CPM party congress in Hyderabad: Can Left reclaim its lost ground?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/cpm-22nd-party-congress-tripura-kerala-sitaram-yechury-alliance-congress-prakash-karat-bengal/story/1/23572.html
429,Madhuri Danthala,"In sync with its fixation for ""uniformity"" across the country, the Narendra Modi government has been toying with the idea of  , for a while now. However, there has been little debate over what the implications of such a drastic change would be for India's political future. With the reports that the government will seek the Election Commission's opinion on whether it can be implemented from next year and the Law Commission likely to submit its report later this month, the matter of simultaneous elections being held in India is once again in focus. The government's primary argument for conducting is that polls are extremely expensive and constantly being in election mode is creating a policy paralysis. As interesting and rational as the idea sounds, it is far from easy (or even desirable) to implement such drastic changes in the country as the Constitution doesn't give a ""fixed term"" to any government. A government is in power as long as it enjoys the confidence of the respective House. Hence, to necessitate such a change, a constitutional amendment needs to be made to fix the term of a government. Arriving at such a consensus would be near impossible, given that we have 29 states. For instance, if a state government was elected in 2016, its normal tenure would last till 2021, (as long as it enjoys the confidence of the House). Thus, if it has to go for elections in 2019, its tenure will be cut short by two years. Another aspect that is unclear is what would happen if in a particular state, there is a breakdown of constitutional machinery and President's Rule is imposed. In such a scenario, would that particular state have to remain under President's Rule for the rest of the term? It would therefore encourage the implementation of Article 356 on flimsy grounds by the central government, if it is faced by a political opponent ruling a state. This will prove detrimental to the federal structure of India. The government is also considering the idea of a motion of confidence to follow a motion of no-confidence. This means that if a government is brought down by a no-confidence motion, then the Opposition has to prove that it has the requisite numbers to form the government. This de facto will rule out any scope for a ruling government to be questioned. This is most dangerous because one of the basic pillars of democracy is accountability. For instance, the BJP had promised to accord Andhra Pradesh the special category status during its election campaign of 2014 but went back on its word after coming to power citing legal complications. If the term of the government is fixed and assured, how can it be questioned? Implementing simultaneous elections will in the long run reduce the importance of the regional parties as people will tend to lean towards the national parties, which is against the spirit of democracy, as it essentially takes away the choice of citizenry. Elections indeed are expensive. But they must not be viewed as a burden on the exchequer because they are the very essence of democracy. If the fear of losing the confidence of the House is removed, governments can become very authoritarian. It is also likely to increase the use of money and muscle power, further scarring our democracy.  The idea of simultaneous elections may appear to solve the problem of frequent elections but will most certainly put our democratic traditions in peril. For a government that has displayed so much disdain for the democratic spirit over the years, the motive of suggesting such an idea needs to be viewed with caution. It is must be ascertained whether the government has the larger interests of the country in mind or some other ulterior motive. This is a government that announced demonetisation overnight without much planning, including basics like whether the Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes would require recalibration of ATMs. It is unlikely that it gave the idea of simultaneous elections in India a deep thought.",2018-04-17,"Demonetisation,Assembly elections,Modi government,Narendra Modi",Why Modi government's idea of simultaneous elections is suspicious and worrying,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/simultaneous-polls-narendra-modi-modi-government-assembly-elections-constitution-democracy-demonetisation/story/1/23526.html
430,Amit Pandey,"After hoisting the saffron flag in the Northeast, the BJP juggernaut is headed towards the southern states, especially Karnataka. The Congress, which is fighting for its existence, has also fastened its belt for the race in Karnataka. This is a three-cornered election, in which the HD Deve Gowda-led Janata Dal (Secular) is the third rival in the race. While the two main rivals - both Congress and the BJP - are confident of winning the elections, history tells a different story. In Karnataka, no party since 1985 came to power for a second consecutive term and no CM has returned after a full five-year term since Devaraj Urs in 1978. Karnataka comprises 224 Assembly seats and 28 Lok Sabha seats. The state is mainly divided into six parts: One is Hyderabad Karnataka, the portion which shares its boundary with Hyderabad. This area has 40 Assembly seats. Then there is Bombay Karnataka (50 seats), Coastal Karnataka (19 seats), Mysore (65 seats), Central Karnataka (22 seats) and Bangalore city (28 seats). The caste arithmetic of the state is going to be one of the most important factors in the coming elections. Lingayats which are the epicentre of this election constitute 17 per cent of the state population. This community can affect results in 100 seats which can be a game-changer for any party. Traditionally Congress supporters, the Lingayats were seemingly disappointed with the Congress when the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi sacked Lingayat CM Veerandra Patil in 1990. In the next elections, the Congress recorded its worst performance till date. Vokkaligas are the second-most important community in the Karnataka. Fifteen per cent of the state population is Vokkaligas - the loyal voter base of the Janata Dal (Secular) party. After the Lingayats raised their demand for separate religious status, Vokkaligas too followed suit. The community is mainly upset with the BJP and the Congress over the much-apparent appeasement of the Lingayats. Vokkaligas are mainly concentrated in southern Karnataka districts including Mandya, Hassan, Mysore, Bangalore (rural), Tumkur, Chikkaballapur, Kolar and Chikmagalur. After these two communities, the third largest community in the state is Dalits. Dalits make 23 per cent the state population. Dalits are further divided into ""Left Dalits"", or Madigas, or ""untouchables"", and ""Right Dalits"", or the ""touchables"" or Holeya communities. Madigas, who are perceived to be at the receiving end of the Congress as they have not been benefitted from any state scheme, are angry with the state government. On the other hand, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, who represents the Holeyas (also referred to as Chalavadis), has consolidated their support for the party. The third party - the JD(S) - which is fighting along with the BSP can sway the Dalit votes and can eat into a large chunk of the Congress’s Dalit vote bank. In the 2008 Assembly elections, the BJP won 22 of 36 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes. The Congress, however, had bounced back in 2013. Muslims, which have so far been side-lined in this elections, too can prove to be a game-changer. Muslims comprise 9 per cent of the state population which are concentrated on the coastal Karnataka. The BJP, in 2013, faced a shocking defeat in the region with just three out of 19 seats while the Congress bagged 12 seats. How the voters cast their ballots in the past and how much votes the respective parties gained in the past elections help understand the pattern. In Karnataka, the Congress never won less than 35 per cent of votes in the state whether Lok Sabha election or Vidhan Sabha (except 1994). In 2014 Lok Sabha elections despite a Modi wave, the Congress was able to bag 41.5 per cent and nine seats. Interestingly in the 2008 state elections, the winning party, BJP, got 33.86 per cent votes while the runner-up Congress won 34.76 per cent votes, 0.9% more than the winner. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP cornered 43.37 per cent and won 17 out of 28 Lok Sabha seats. Going by the to 2014 Lok Sabha election results, the BJP can easily achieve the target of 113 seats. In 2008, the BJP got 33.86 per cent votes, which is 10 per cent less than 2014. The JD(S), which bagged 20.15 per cent votes in the 2013 Assembly polls, saw a major decline in 2014. The party gained a mere 11.07 per cent votes with just two seats in the elections. This time around, the JD(S) is again at a position where it can be a potential kingmaker, if neither party gets a clear majority. While caste arithmetic and voting patterns are two important factors for any political party to focus on in the elections, the above-stated factors are still not enough to predict the results this year. What is, however, easy to predict is that this election will be a tightrope walk for all the three parties - the Congress, the BJP and the JD(S).",2018-04-17,"JD(S),BJP,Congress,Karnataka Assembly polls",Why Karnataka Assembly elections 2018 will be difficult to predict,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-elections-congress-bjp-jds-vokkaligas-lingayats-siddaramaiah-yeddyurappa-deve-gowda/story/1/23523.html
431,Manish Dubey,"The Haryana government’s April 11   to concerns around the information it is collecting statewide through a   raises more questions than it answers. For those coming in late, the form mandatorily seeks information on, among other things, students’ and parents’ name as mentioned in their Aadhaar cards, students’ bank accounts (if they have one), parents’ mobile numbers, parents’ occupations, including whether they are into ""unclean"" jobs, and parents’ annual income. Among the optional fields are students’ and parents’ Aadhaar numbers and parents’ permanent account numbers (PANs). Media reports suggest that not all schools are comfortable asking parents to furnish such unusual data, and the Opposition has flayed the form for its casteist tone and alleged a surveillance agenda behind it. Before analysing the government’s official defence, let us first respond to a line that its apologists initially took: that ""serious"" data like Aadhaar and PAN are optional, implying thereby that the exercise was not as coercive or intrusive as it is made out to be. This is far from the truth. In routing data collection through schools, the government has been clever to not only cast the net wide (given high enrolment levels in the state), but also expect high compliance. Mindful of wards’ interests, schools are institutions that most parents adhere to and, hence, are unlikely to take information requests from them lightly. Further, in embedding a sizeable number of optional questions and hinting at how the data collected would lead to streamlining of government benefits to students, the exercise has ensured that parents will think twice before omitting an optional field. Would an incomplete form impact available or potential benefits for my child, especially since others may be submitting fully filled-in forms? This is a question most would ask themselves. The optional field is an optional one only in theory once such a question is being raised. There is little doubt that the government is conscious of the optics of making certain fields mandatory, but also aware of the subtle pressures operating on parents when it comes to information solicited via schools. Hence, the pushing of the potentially contentious Aadhaar and PAN fields to optional-in-name fields. At another level, there are no clear answers on why certain fields are optional? If the data collection objectives were contingent upon these fields, why not make them mandatory? And if not contingent upon, why have them in the form in the first place? In short, the ""most fields are optional"" argument is specious. The government’s central line of defence - that data gathered will ensure better targeting and flow of benefits under various central and state government schemes, including direct transfer of monetary benefits to students’ bank accounts - cuts no ice either. The stated purpose of the exercise demands that: (a) all students eligible for benefits under various schemes identify themselves; and, (b) relevant bank account details are known, logically, including those of parents in case students themselves do not have bank accounts. The form ensures neither. Disclosure of mental and physical disabilities is optional, meaning the exercise may not yield a comprehensive database of all eligible beneficiaries. And, with bank account details restricted to students’ accounts, direct transfer of monetary benefits may not be possible in the large number of cases where students do not have bank accounts of their own. More importantly, the streamlining objective of the exercise would remain unfulfilled even if disability data was mandatory and parents’ bank account details were collected. For things to be truly simplified, the government would need to go a few steps further, accept all self-disclosures at face value, and eschew its customary documentation and verification procedures - this is implausible, given both the absence of any concrete policy roadmap expressing such intent and administrators’ ingrained (and not entirely misplaced) suspicion of self-attested data. In effect, it means that the form will generate data without any significant change to business processes - making it a meaningless exercise. Or worse, given the many imaginative ways of harassing citizens the lower bureaucracy is capable of, an added layer of complication in accessing legitimate benefits. With the exercise thus being optional only in name and data collected unlikely to serve its stated purpose, it is only natural for speculation to occur on the exercise’s true motives, especially at a time when efforts to link Aadhaar numbers to mobile numbers and PAN are under scrutiny. Could the form be a sly attempt to obtain such data? One does not know for sure, but in the absence of any explicit assurance that data from the form will be used only for its stated purpose and the general wariness about data leakage, it is a question worth raising. Further, with the exercise, there is also the likelihood of individual’s data lying around in thousands of schools across the state, and mindboggling prospects of their misuse. Last but not the least, there is something to be said about the mention of unclean occupations. In its defence, the government has said the term is not its original coinage and finds mention in existing laws and scheme guidelines. This is lame. Surely, there could be more sensitive ways to probe this. Its own official response breaks down unclean occupations into ""presently engaged in tanning/ flaying"" and ""engaged in manual scavenging up to January 1, 1997"" and these themselves could have been used in the form. But then that perhaps was too much to expect from a form and an exercise that is ham-handed and exceptionable at so many levels.",2018-04-17,"Aadhaar,Admission form,Schools,Haryana",Why Haryana school admission form raises some serious questions,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/haryana-schools-admission-form-students-aadhaar-number-parents-in-unclean-jobs/story/1/23525.html
432,Shiv Visvanathan,"Violence creates its own miasma as it spreads across the country. Yet, the inadequate way in which violence is read geographically, politically and ethically adds to the dreariness of morality in India. It is not only a question of lynch mobs pretending they are the law or even the idea that riots are a natural prelude to electoral process. This also includes the way sexual abuse is constructed, especially in the political domain. There is ritual of predictable indifference surrounding the event, as if minors, marginals and women are dispensable any way. Second, the administration seeks a quick erasure, feeling almost helpless before politicians and powerfully connected people who think of rape as a regular entitlement. The dreariness accumulates as one realises that while there are local protests, there is no attempt to connect these events and even ask whether, under the BJP regime, which is pretentiously committed to moral policing whether through its cohorts in the Bajrang Dal or the VHP, there is a bid to seek a way where power and majoritarianism condones or wishes away rape and social abuse. The power of scandal lies not just in the brutality of raping a minor, an equivalent scandal lies in the emptiness of the response, the hypocrisy of cover-ups, the terrorising immediacy of right-wing groups claiming that rape of marginals and minors is inevitable, even condonable. The stories from Unnao and Kathua have been reported in the papers. Yet, they create little sense of moral horror. It is as if politics and power creates an immunity system from such crimes. It is not the absolute power of a dictatorship that is frightening in India. It is the terror and the disgust that minor politicians and MLAs strike, enabling a wave of sexual perversion as part of the privileges of politics. Sometimes, I think, it is not absolute power that corrupts, it is the ordinariness of power that creates a moral universe which even a Kafka would tremble at. A society’s passivity in saying “let the law take its course” creates an erasure and a thickening coat of indifference that makes one ponder about the moral economy of a democracy. Can India be a normative society, a moral entity with Kathua and Unnao becoming everyday events in a democracy where justice becomes a mockery? The facts are almost morbidly clear, displaying a sick society at its blatant worst. Kathua is a district in Jammu and Kashmir. According to the police, a minor girl was abducted, raped and murdered in Rassana Village in the Hiranagar tehsil. The details state that the girl, who belonged to a migrant nomadic community, was gang-raped in a prayer hall. There is a dastardly occult or fetishistic element to the acts, as the perpetrators had carried out some unmentionable rituals on the girl. Not only was she detained in captivity, but one of the members of the group was summoned all the way from Meerut so that he could satisfy “his lust”. The girl was forcibly kept on sedatives, brutally beaten and repeatedly raped by the group as if they were rotating a rare opportunity. The scandal does not stop here. The obscenity continues as a group of lawyers sought to thwart the charge sheet demanding a CBI probe to delay the process. The lawyers were almost guiltless, making one wonder about the state of law, not just law and order, in Jammu. Worse, the Hindu Ekta Manch marched through Kathua, unfolding the Tricolour. Rightist and fundamentalist groups circling the BJP almost seem to believe that their righteous Hindutva gives them a coating of piety and their association with BJP, a charmed circle of immunity. It is almost as if rape is no longer a moral issue but a political instrument to be used by the powerful for fostering their ends. When one listens to the Unnao rape case, one senses again the variety and inventiveness of violence and brutality in India. A teenager was gang raped by the BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh and his brothers. Her father, who protested, was assaulted by Singh’s family and died in custody. The brutality of his death is captured in the post-mortem report, which highlights 14 different injuries apart from other bruises. Pictures of Kuldeep Singh Sengar reveal a complacent man, almost proud of his act and power. In fact, the Uttar Pradesh DGP, in what could be an act of political correctness, or rampant sycophancy, addressed Sengar as the “honourable MLA”, making one wonder how far sycophancy will cater or fawn at power. There is little sense of loss or disgust among the official functionaries about what is occurring. One needs an ethical act, which reviews the moral unconscious of this country. Majoritarian politics is India’s own way of ritualising what the political philosopher Hannah Arendt called banalisation of evil.

433,Vivashwan Singh,"The prevailing  , allegedly unleashed by the Trinamool Congress against the Left candidates over filing of nominations for the panchayat polls, must ring bells of anarchy for anyone believing in democracy. It is evident that the Trinamool Congress has disregarded the basic principles of democracy which is the right of the Opposition to take part in the elections. The filing of nomination, which began on Monday (April 2) and is supposed to be wrapped within a week, has seen unprecedented violence, injury and even deaths in a span of just three days. Hundreds of Left and opposition candidates have been injured and their identity cards and other documents were snatched away. In many places, offices of the parties have been reportedly raided by Trinamool men to snatch away papers and to threaten people. On April 5, former MP and CPI(M) Central Committee member Ramachandra Dome was brutally attacked and he sustained a head injury while leading a group of candidates to file nominations at Nalhati in Birbhum district. 
 
 The miscreants also assaulted the wife and daughter-in-law of former MLA Biswanath Karak of Forward Bloc in broad daylight on the roads of Arambagh when both of them were going to submit their nominations. Sujan Chakraborty, CPIM leader in Bengal Assembly, has also been assaulted in Bankura in the presence of police by armed criminals, who were shouting slogans of ""Mamata Banerjee zindabad"" and ""Jai Shri Ram"". Basudeb Acharia, CPI(M) veteran and nine-time MP from Bankura, had also been severely beaten with bamboo sticks, allegedly by a group of Trinamool cadres in front of the police while leading a group to file their nominations for the panchayat polls. Shockingly, in all these attacks, the police has either refused to intervene, or, is in collaboration with the Trinamool cadres. A  from Raghunathganj in Murshidabad district was published in   lately. The armed gang, police and special commando forces are supposedly in collaboration against opposition candidates to prevent them from submission of nominations in the upcoming Panchayat elections. The criminals are carrying arms along with the law enforcement angencies. Mamata Banerjee is presiding over the total wipe out of constitutional rights of the citizens in the state. Armed Trinamool gang, actively supported by police ferociously attacked the procession led by Left. Just seven years back in 2011, Bengal's intellectuals had unitedly come out to support Mamata Banerjee’s protest against the Left Front's actions in Singur and Nandigram. A range of Kolkata's literati from Aparna Sen to Mahesweta Devi and Mrinal Sen were all speaking on the need for ""poriborton"" or change.  Even Arundhati Roy, Sumit Sarkar, Uma Chakravarty, Tanika Sarkar, Moinak Biswas, Kaushik Ghosh, Saroj Giri, Sourin Bhattacharya, Nirmalangshu Mukherji, Sibaji Bandyopadhyay, Swapan Chakravorty, Rajarshi Dasgupta, Anand Chakravarty, Apoorvanand, Shuddhabrata Sengupta, Nivedita Menon, Aditya Nigam and Medha Patkar, all of whom were a part of the Liberal-Left protesting against CPI(M) during the Nandigram incident, are nowhere in sight when democracy is diminishing in Bengal. It seems that these intellectuals safeguard their right to criticise the Left parties at any given opportunity and expect resolute unanimity from them while in trouble. They also remained mute spectators when murderous attacks have been unleashed by fascist forces against the Left in different parts of the country. It is interesting to note that Mamata Banerjee in 2014 had through a cabinet decision decided to drop cases against 303 criminals whom the previous Left Front government had filed cases by referring them as land activists of Nandigram. Finding fault in Left Front government in Bengal for all its failures is completely understandable, but that does not mean becoming a mute spectator when another political party turns democracy into anarchy in a state. At present, not even a distant appearance of democracy exists in Bengal. Even considering the standards established by the TMC, this is disturbing. And most importantly, Trinamool miscreants who shout ""Jai Shri Ram"" while assaulting Left activists will not have second thoughts in switching over to the side of the RSS/BJP when the time is ripe. If even a part of what happened to Basudev Acharia, Ramachandra Dome and Biswanath Karak had happened to Medha Patkar, Prakash Raj, Jignesh Mevani, Shabnam Hashmi or Teesta Setalvad, would the CPI(M) have kept as quiet as they are today? It is only the CPI(M), which supported and gave a platform to these activists. What is shocking is the absolute silence over violence in Bengal in contrast to the clamour on Pehlu Khan and Junaid. The killers of Pehlu Khan, Junaid and Akhlaq deserve the harshest of punishment and no mercy should be shown to them. But what is disgusting is the manner in which the intellectuals have been selectively voicing certain incidents with respect to media coverage.   If in 2015 more than 40 novelists, essayists, playwrights and poets could return their Sahitya Akademi awards in protest against rising intolerance in the country, then why be indifferent now?   One of the most prominent of them the, Nayantara Sahgal, who claimed that “India’s culture of diversity and debate is now under vicious assault”, is nowhere in sight when intolerance has reached to an extent where the CM of West Bengal openly claims that she wants “ ”. If these people truly yearn for democracy, then they should also speak up against Mamata Banerjee’s autocratic rule. The silence of other non-Bengal parties should also be looked upon. Former CMs of Hindi heartland, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati have been silent on what is happening in Bengal. Some might assume that Ramachandra Dome is a bit less Dalit and not worthy of their considerate support because he marches under the Red flag and not under that of the Samajwadi Party or the Bahujan Samaj Party. I doubt that the aspirants of the third front like K Chandrashekhar Rao, Sharad Pawar and others will rethink their relation with Banerjee, since an unrivalled TMC will yield maximum numbers in the Lok Sabha. The murderous attacks on opposition candidates have brought out the authoritarian character of TMC most crudely. In a joint statement, five Left leaders, Communist Party of India-Marxist general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Communist Party of India national secretary D Raja, All India Forward Bloc's Dharmendra Kumar, Pran Nath of Socialist Unity Centre of India-Communist and Kavita Krishnan of CPI-ML Liberation have accused the Trinamool of having resorted to a ""full-fledged assault on democracy and the rule of law”. The BJP has also filed a plea in the Supreme Court seeking re-scheduling of the election. Even regular meetings of the Left Front delegation with the state election commissioner were rendered futile as the latter expressed his inability to address any of their grievances. The state EC has completely surrendered and has remained totally insensitive to atrocities committed in the state. All these incidents are taking form of a pre-poll rigging which if not addressed at the earliest will make the elections a farce. The intellectuals’ silence, the police’s support, the bureaucracy’s fear and the public’s ignorance is gradually aiding a process which is not only inhuman, barbaric and dictatorial, but essentially is one that projects India as the biggest mockery of democracy.",2018-04-14,"Poll violence,Panchayat Polls,West Bengal,Mamata Banerjee",The shocking silence of liberals on panchayat poll violence in Bengal,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/west-bengal-panchayat-polls-filing-of-nominations-violence-trinamool-mamata-banerjee-cpm-bjp/story/1/23476.html
434,Mehr Tarar,"Once upon a time in a country called Pakistan, a massively popular prime minister appointed – in what would in hindsight be considered one of his biggest strategic follies by his supporters and even most of his detractors – an unassuming, nondescript, yes-sir type of a general as the chief of army staff. In an unexpected and a rather unpopular move – this prime minister was known for doing what he wanted to, consequences be damned – in which five senior generals were superseded, the awkwardly smiling general, known for his devotion to religion and love for golf, was appointed to the top military position. Considering him non-threatening in the context of the very relevant civilian-military power tussle in Pakistan in which the latter seemed to win most of the time, the prime minister’s singular act set into motion a series of events that changed Pakistan, kind of irrevocably. The date was April 1, 1976. The irony was unmistakable. And thus began the saga of the war of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Zia-ul-Haq that culminated in the judicial killing of one in 1977 and ended – or so it was thought – with the mysterious assassination of the other in 1988. Merely a year after his appointment, amidst the noise and allegations by the Pakistan National Alliance of nationwide electoral rigging against Bhutto’s victory, on July 5, 1977, the general staged a midnight coup, ousted Bhutto’s government, put him under house arrest, and assuming the position of the chief martial law administrator, imposed martial law in Pakistan. And in a speech to the nation that he, ostensibly, was protecting from the evil machinations of a cheat of a democratic leader who rigged his way into a colossal electoral victory, the general promised elections in 90 days. The next elections took place in 1985. The elections were party-less. As the country and the ousted Bhutto and other politicians waited for their release, and waited for the promised elections, Zia announced an accountability process of the elected politicians. The starkly titled Disqualification Tribunal disqualified many politicians from contesting elections for seven years, followed by a white paper against Bhutto and his party. Criminal proceedings against Bhutto on conspiracy to murder of a political rival were set into motion. 1977 was catastrophic for many things, some yet to unfold. The trial of Bhutto started in October 1977 and ended on March 8, 1978 when he was charged as guilty by a Supreme Court ruling four to three against him. Bhutto was sentenced to death. To date Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto remains the most popular public leader, whom millions idolised, and wept for in their homes during his captivity. A year after his cleanup Pakistan initiative, Zia coroneted himself with another honour: he became the president of Pakistan. The position had recently become available after the tenure of Fazal Illahi ended. Someone had to serve the country. Apparently, there was only one man suited to do the honour. Pakistan witnessed the spectacle on September 16, 1978. On April 4, 1979, despite requests of clemency from international leaders and hopes and prayers of millions of Pakistanis, amidst condemnation of lawyers and jurists, Zia hanged Bhutto. The act came to be known as the first judicial murder of an elected prime minister. The repercussions of that one event were manifold. In 1980, doing away with Parliament, Zia envisioning his own form of democracy, created the Majlis-e-Shura (consultative council). Since all political parties had been banned in 1978, Zia formed a body consisting of a kind of board of advisors to “assist him in his process of Islamisation.” The number of members was 284, and they were handpicked by the president, to consult with the president and to endorse the decisions of the president. Dissent and debate were not allowed. Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif  – the future three-time prime minister of Pakistan – was one of Zia’s favoured protégés, and understandably, a member of the Shura. He later became the finance minister of Punjab. After the 1985 party-less elections, Zia, partial to making of various amendments in the constitution, oversaw his government pass the Eighth Amendment. That innocuous sounding amendment bestowed absolute power on the president: “...the President may also dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion where, in his opinion...” Pakistan had a new prime minister, Mohammad Khan Junejo. Zia was of course the president. Nawaz Sharif became the chief minister of Punjab in 1985. That was the first of the two times he held the position. On May 1988, Zia, using his presidential power under 58-2(B), dissolved Junejo’s government, for “failing to maintain law and order” in the country. Many reasons are given for Junejo’s dismissal but the real one is said to be a clash of egos. “… the people knew well that … there were no major differences between them; the only thing was that General Zia wanted all powers in his hands,” Ziaul Islam Ansari, a journalist Zia said to like and trust, wrote in his book on Zia. There was more to come. The Article 62 of the Constitution “defines the eligibility of candidates to be elected representatives of the people.” The clause containing Islamic titles Sadiq and Ameen, given by the people of Makkah to Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) for his impeachable moral integrity and honesty, was added to Article 62 under Zia as “part of his policy of turning the legal system of Pakistan toward Islamisation.” Zia was killed in a plane crash on August 17, 1988. Pakistan, stunned, awaited what was to come. On December 2, 1988, Benazir Bhutto became the first female prime minister of Pakistan, and the first female prime minister of the Muslim world. On August 6, 1990, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan invoking Article 58(2)b dismissed Benazir Bhutto’s first government. The allegation: corruption. On November 6, 1990, Nawaz Sharif became the prime minister of Pakistan. On April 17,1993, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan invoking Article 58(2)b dismissed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s government. The allegations: corruption and “unleashing a reign of terror” against political foes. On October 19, 1993, after her party’s electoral success, Benazir Bhutto became the prime minister for the second time. On November 4, 1996, Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari invoking 58(2)b dismissed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto’s government. Leghari was a Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) veteran and one of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s most trusted political comrades. The allegations: corruption and mismanagement. On February 17, 1997, Nawaz Sharif became the prime minister for the second time. On October 12, 1999, the then chief of army staff Pervez Musharraf staged a coup against the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and overthrew his government. His reason was stark: “To stop any further politicisation or destabilisation of the military.” General Musharraf after taking over the reins of power, subverting the constitution here and there, ruled Pakistan until 2008, assuming the position of president in 2001. Following Benazir Bhutto’s shockingly tragic assassination on December 27, 2007, the PPP in 2008 defeating Musharraf’s party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid, commonly known as the King’s party, came into power. In May 2012, the Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Chaudhry disqualified Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani. Gillani on April 26, 2012, had been found guilty of contempt of court for his refusal of compliance with a Supreme Court order to reopen a fraud investigation against President Asif Ali Zardari. Interestingly, it was Nawaz Sharif among other political leaders who demanded Gillani’s resignation after the April 26 verdict, saying: “Prime minister should immediately resign. He should step down without causing further crisis. The court’s verdict is based on truth and reality. It must have punished the prime minister with a heavy heart, but the prime minister himself is to be blamed. The prime minister himself invited this situation.” On June 5, 2013, Nawaz Sharif became the prime minister of Pakistan for the third time. On July 29, 2017, the Supreme Court of Pakistan using 62(1)(f) disqualified Sharif in the Panama Papers case. Once again, Sharif was no longer the prime minister. On April 13, 2018, the Supreme Court gave the ruling: The disqualification of any member of parliament or a public servant under Article 62 (1)(f) in the future will be “permanent”. Such a person cannot contest elections or become a member of parliament. Nawaz Sharif has a unique record: he is the first prime minister to be elected thrice but has not been able to complete even one term. Pause and rewind: In 2010, the parliament during Zardari’s government passed the 18th Amendment, divesting “the president of all his executive authority making him a ceremonial head of state.” While the PPP government, endorsed by some other parties, wished to remove articles 62 and 63 from the Constitution, it was Nawaz Sharif and his party that opposed the idea. In 2017, serving his third tenure as the elected prime minister of Pakistan, Sharif was removed from the office by the Supreme Court of Pakistan using Article 62(1)(f). In April 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the disqualification handed down under Article 62 (1)(f) of the Constitution is for life. In 41 years, much changed but nothing really changed. The last two governments are the first two governments to finish their full tenure, but one thing remains unaltered: not one of the 15 prime ministers of Pakistan in its turbulent, bizarre and utterly intriguing 70-year political history has finished his/her full term. Not one.",2018-04-15,"Supreme Court,Democracy,Pakistan,Nawaz Sharif",Why no Pakistani prime minister has finished a full term,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/nawaz-sharif-pakistan-democracy-supreme-court-zulfiqar-ali-bhutto-zia-ul-haq/story/1/23487.html
435,Vrinda Gopinath,"In a spectacular display of guts and gumption,   from the BJP have lashed out against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the party leadership accusing them of discrimination, negligence, barbarity and injustice. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath may have trotted out several Dalit MPs in his favour a day ago, but the rebels have challenged and castigated the party forcefully and impressively. They have taken on the largely upper-caste party leadership, causing the latter embarrassment and discomfiture, even as the Dalit MPs lend support and sanction to the swell of Dalit pride and defiance that is blazing across the country. Have the rebel Dalit MPs exposed Muslim leaders in the party, the other discriminated and hated community of Hindutva BJP, as being gutless and meek? The roll call of Dalit MP rebels is impressive, four from caste-volatile Uttar Pradesh - Savitri Bai Phule, MP from Bahraich, who has been exploding on every available public platform; Chhote Lal Kharwar, MP from Robertsganj, who angrily wrote to Modi complaining he had been thrown out of Adityanath’s office; Ashok Dohre, MP from Etawah, who has accused Uttar Pradesh police of ritually harassing Dalits ever since last week’s Bharat bandh called by Dalit groups; and Yashwant Singh, MP from Nageen, who has written to Modi accusing his government of doing nothing for Dalit empowerment and development. The latest to join them is Udit Raj, MP from Delhi, who has lamented that Dalits in many states (all ruled by the BJP) were being tortured and having false cases slapped on them. It must be said that except for Yashwant Singh and Udit Raj, who joined the BJP only in 2014, others like Phule has been with the party since 2005, while the rest began their political career with the BJP. The Dalit rebel MPs have been variously accused of being shrewd and calculating, for sensing the mood of defiance and hostility among the community against the upper caste UP CM and the BJP leadership. Political savvy apart, the rebel MPs have risked party censure and reprimand by listening to their conscience and hitting out because of the glaring discrimination of the people of their community – from the rampant and widespread violence, ritual insults, atrocities, public floggings and murderous assault, from Una in Gujarat to Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh. The last provocation was the dilution of the SC/ST Atrocities Act which was not challenged by the BJP, and was pushed to do so only after the eruption of Bharat bandh called by various Dalit organisations last week. Worse, the BJP state governments were seen to be lax in investigating the deaths of nine Dalits who were killed during the protests. So, where does it leave the roll call of luminary BJP Muslim leaders who have mutely watched as Hindutva-affiliated goons began Modi’s tenure in 2014 with murderous assaults on the community, randomly picking on innocent members all over the country and killing them in the name of cow slaughter, love jihad, forced conversion, or hate crimes for just being a Muslim? Leaders like Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, MJ Akbar, who are ministers in the Modi government; Najma Heptullah is a governor, apart from Shahnawaz Hussain, minority cell member Asifa Khan, Shazia Ilmi, Ijaz Ilmi who are spokespersons for the party, have remained mum on atrocities against their community. Apart from murderous attacks and institutional biases and discrimination, the BJP leaders have been heaping insults and choice abuses on the community – from party president Amit Shah’s hate speeches, calls for revenge and constant incitement of anti-Muslim sentiment in election campaigns, to Modi’s refusal, as PM, to condemn hate crimes against the community, to the rampant provocative speeches and verbal attacks of BJP leaders, all of which actively promotes Hindutva ultra-nationalism and communal rioting and murders. Ministers like Naqvi have been more loyal than the Sangh when he publicly chided those who wanted to eat beef to  , while Akbar did a U-turn from asking his then PM Rajiv Gandhi to overturn Shah Bano verdict to appease the Muslim clergy, as opposed to pushing his present PM Modi’s Triple Talaq Bill despite reservation from women Islamic scholars and activists, Shazia Ilmi has been appointed independent director of Engineers India Ltd, a PSU; so has Asifa Khan been appointed on the board of Hindustan Petroleum Ltd. Muslim BJP leaders have justified their allegiance to the Hindutva fold saying they have only contempt for the Congress and other ""secular"" parties for their ""appeasement"" of the community and using them as a ""vote bank"" whereas the BJP believes in ""inclusive"" politics. Others who have joined the party recently say they were lured by Modi’s new avatar as ""development man"". And even as a Shahnawaz Hussain justifies the refusal of tickets to Muslim candidates, from Gujarat to Uttar Pradesh, saying “winnability” is the sole criteria, no leader has asked why Muslims cannot be given tickets at election time when Hindu candidates have lost pretty majorly too. So, will BJP Muslim leaders take the cudgel from Dalit leaders and finally challenge the hate campaign and attacks on the community? Will they have the daring and spunk to crusade and lobby within the party organsiation for genuine inclusiveness, justice and empowerment of the hapless and disenfranchised within the community?

436,Sanghamitra Baruah,"Poll promises, like a scrumptious pie, leave a lingering aftertaste. So, when Narendra Modi, as BJP's PM candidate, let out the now-famous 2014 general election slogan ""na khaunga, na khaane dunga"", it stayed on voters' minds. Four years down the line, the same voters, especially farmers, Dalits, Muslims and the unemployed youth, are out in protest against the Modi government for blinding their judgement with a rich potion of poorly kept promises. So, when the PM on Thursday (April 12) led a hunger strike to expose Congress’ “undemocratic style of functioning and divisive politics and anti-development agenda”, the country — with   living below the international poverty line — found it hard to gulp down the irony. Many wondered what the PM actually meant by ""na khaunga, na khaane dunga"". According to PM Modi, the people who couldn’t gain power in 2014 ""don’t want the country to move forward. They didn’t let Parliament work for a single day. They killed democracy... They don't want the nation to develop."" It's the same plank of ""development for all"" - Sabka Saath and Sabka Vikas - with which the BJP succeeded in securing a massive mandate in 2014 general elections and later. PM Modi knows it's time again to sell the same dream with more elections waiting to decide his government's fate. But for how long can you sell the same dreams? Apparently, in India, it's easy to recycle dreams and sell them to the same people again and again, just like the previous governments had done in the past. In November 2016, the country saw the most radical economic change. Although it proved to be back-breaking for the poor, the people of the country played along and assisted the government that claimed it to be a   ""experiment"". (And you thought only guinea pigs are experimental tools). The illusion of the go-go economy that the PM created has been ripped apart in various reports and analyses. While almost everyone, including his  , agrees that demonetisation was a big failure, the PM refuses to acknowledge that his policy gambles, which now include a badly  have sucked the nation's economy dry and slowed down India’s ""meteoric"" growth.  Added to that, the increasing share of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector is reason enough to indicate what led to the growth slowdown. Even though the impact of GST and demonetisation is slowly fading away, the economy is yet to  — more so with the albatross of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) hanging around the nation's neck.  Yet, there is no slowdown on the BJP's inflated rhetoric.  It didn't matter to the PM Modi that thousands of farmers walked close to 200km to draw attention to the agrarian crisis, to ask for what is theirs - their right to survive. It didn't matter to the PM when Dalits and Muslims lost their livelihood following the ban on the sale of cattle for slaughter, which the  . It doesn't need much understanding of the economy to gauge the real motive behind the ill-conceived restrictions on livestock trade. It was clear the ban was intended to hit hard industries such as leather that mostly employ Muslims and Dalits.  According to a   report last year, the Modi government’s ban on the trade of cattle for slaughter ""threatened $4 billion in annual beef exports and millions of jobs if the government didn't revoke the stoppage"". So, when the BJP and its affiliates unleashed this economic terror in the form of gau rakshaks, it was the Muslims and Dalits who were the most affected. According to another Reuters  , the ""organised attempt at stealing livelihoods of Muslims"" had a sinister design to seize their cattle and sell them off to Hindu farmers or cow shelters. The November 7 report said: “Hindu nationalists are beating up Muslim farmers and seizing their cows on the grounds that the animals are headed for the slaughterhouse. But there’s another side to this religiously-tinged violence: The stolen cows are being given to Hindu farmers.” The same investigation said that as many as 1,90,000 cows were seized, stolen, forcibly acquired from Muslims since 2014 in such cow terrorism incidents. The aggression on the PM's much-hated ""pink economy"" proved to be politically rewarding for the BJP in making India ""Congress-mukt"" with massive election wins in state after state. The government, in ample measure, showed where its concerns lie and with whom. So, it's not surprising when Hindutva forces conspire to drive out nomadic shepherd communities with the brutal rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl, the prime minister doesn't even feel the need to break his silence or to stage a hunger strike in protest. If it's about democracy and India's development, there is more damning evidence to nail the PM's lies and promises. The PM famously  and instead offered pakoda-selling as an alternative, further leading one to doubt the real intent of his ""na khaunga, na khane doonga"" promise. Damning figures on the employment crisis only go on to strengthen the doubts.  According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank,  were looking for employment opportunities as of February this year. The unemployment rate in India — nearly two-thirds of the jobless are under 35 years old — hit its highest level in 16 months in March at 6.23 per cent. So, when the prime minister of the country and his huge brigade of supporters decide to stage a hunger strike to save Indian democracy and expose the Opposition's anti-development agenda, it surely seems like he is pulling a fast one on us.    ",2018-04-12,"Budget Session,Parliament disruptions,PM Modi's Fast",How PM Modi just pulled a fast one on us,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pm-modi-fast-go-back-modi-congress-bjp-kathua-rape-murder-no-jobs-demonetisation-bank-crisis/story/1/23437.html
437,Ashok K Singh,"It's not a fast. It's a battle cry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dramatic announcement of a  and instructions to party MPs to do the same in their constituencies is a declaration of his determination to take the political battle straight to the Opposition camp. He is using the weapon of fast not as a means of penitence for the   but in preparations for the 2019 general elections. Asking party MPs to gather supporters in large numbers from the constituencies on the occasion is the beginning of mobilisation for the big battle. Calling the party to  , Modi accused Opposition parties of trampling upon democratic principles by holding Parliament to ransom because of their ""political arrogance"" and ""hunger for power"". Launching a scathing attack on the Congress, he said, ""A handful of people who were unable to come to power in 2014 do not want the country to progress. They didn't allow Parliament to function even for a single day."" Later, a BJP statement stated, ""Despite repeated failures in derailing the development model of the prime minister, the Opposition has been constantly disrupting Parliament and not allowing the government to bring several important legislations which are aimed at making India a stronger and better nation."" It doesn't stand to reason for Modi to use fast as a means of agitation against Opposition. Prime ministers and ruling parties don't have to protest and agitate to secure a demand that only they can meet. There is no precedent for a party in the government to hold public agitations and protests. Protests and agitations are means available to Opposition parties to press their demands that the government is unwilling to concede. Therefore, there is no case for Modi to observe a fast as a means of agitation and ask the party MPs to hold nationwide protest. The only justification for observing such a fast could have been penitence. That, unfortunately, has no place in Modi's political strategy. One could understand if Modi had said that he would observe a symbolic fast to lament the decline of parliamentary procedures. He hasn't done that. He is on agitation path, Modi has himself declared. In fact, Modi has missed an opportunity to garner public opinion through his fast. Imagine the impact Modi would have made if he had decided to fast for the minor girl of Unnao, who has accused a BJP legislator of rape, and tried to kill herself, demanding justice from the UP chief minister and who lost her father as a result of beatings and tortures by the alleged rapists brother and goons. Imagine the impact Modi would have made on the people if he had fasted for the eight-year-old Kathua girl from Jammu whose brutal rape and murder has shaken the conscience of the country. The entire country is shocked beyond belief and agitated over the two cases of rapes of minor girls that are a grim reminder of the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder. The Yogi Adityanath government's   in dealing with the Unnao case, its open patronage and protection to the accused BJP MLA have crossed all boundaries of responsibility. The Adityanath government has transgressed all limits of its own law. A token fast by Modi would have stirred the conscience of BJP leaders in Jammu, who are trying to block investigation into the Kathua case by all sorts of means. But why speak of conscience when the BJP has allowed its party leaders to communalise the Kathua rape with a view to scuttle the probe and protecte the guilty while Modi remained a mute spectator? As for Modi's protest over Parliament impasse, he should know that the ruling party doesn't have to agitate if it has a grievance. The prime minister as the leader of the House and the ruling party has to coax, cajole, confer and build consensus to carry out the government's agenda. It's the government responsibility to ensure that the House runs and important legislations are passed. The government has to work out compromises and consensus if the Opposition disrupts the process. There is no evidence that Modi and BJP parliamentary party leaders made any serious outreach to Opposition to break the logjam in Parliament.

On the contrary, there are indications that the  on the Cauvery issue to thwart TDP and YSR Congress' attempt to move a no-confidence motion against the government. Later, Congress and CPI (M) too pressed for a no-confidence motion but the Lok Sabha didn't take up the matter as the House was repeatedly adjourned. What's playing out in the public is politics of fast. BJP's tit-for-tat fast is a response to Congress president Rahul Gandhi's fast at the Rajghat in protest against the increasing cases of atrocities against Dalits and minorities. One may dismiss Rahul Gandhi's fast as a gimmick. But that's a route open to him in a democratic system. The rationale behind the prime minster going on the agitation route is hard to understand. The only explanation can be Modi's decision to sound the election bugle one year before its schedule.

438,Ashok K Singh,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reprimand to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has come too late and it’s also too little. Modi and BJP president Amit Shah in separate meetings in Delhi on Saturday (April 7) are understood to have   on the knuckles over simmering revolt of Dalit MPs, loss in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections and general lacklustre performance of the state government.   Alarmed by UP’s four Dalit MPs’ revolt in protest against cases of increasing violence against Dalits under the Yogi government, Amit Shah will be visiting Lucknow on April 11 to take stock of the situation and plan corrective measures. The situation is indeed alarming. A day after Modi and Shah scolded Yogi, a minor girl attempted to kill herself in front of the chief minster’s residence. The 16-year-old girl has alleged that Kuldeep Singh Sengar, BJP legislators from  , raped her. Rather than arresting the guilty, the Yogi police arrested the father of the girl on the legislator’s complaint. He died in judicial custody on Monday (April 9), allegedly as a result of police torture. Modi must be worried about the repercussions of the cases of rising violence against Dalits and deteriorating law and order situation ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. At least 49 people have been killed in 1,000 police encounters, many reported to be staged-managed cases. The worry is that the slide in the BJP’s performance that was reflected in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur results and the anger of Dalits will seal the party’s fate in 2019 if situations don’t improve. However, an important question to ask is whether Modi’s scolding can bring about a change in Yogi’s attitude? Is Yogi capable of putting the party back on the road to recovery? The answer is no. It’s late for course correction to win over the people - Dalits, Muslims - Yogi has alienated with his high handedness, arrogance and incompetence. His inexperience in government affairs has left a void in administration. There is a mess all around in UP. It’s late for Yogi to suddenly turn leaf and morph into a seasoned administrator and grasp the intricacies of governance. It’s late for him to win over estranged people who had enthusiastically voted for the BJP in the Assembly elections despite setbacks of demonetisation. The issue is not just about Yogi’s incompetence and the government’s pathetic performance. It’s Yogi’s ideology. Modi should have known the saffron-robed Yogi has built his political career on the back of communal and sectarian politics. He has been a rabble-rouser spewing hatred for Muslims; he has been the face of hardline Hindutva zealots. “Sabka saath, sabka vikaas” is not his creed. Yogi lacks the manner in which Modi can transcend ideological rigidity to carry the people along. As the mahant of Gorakhnath temple, Yogi has not learnt the art of political persuasion. His ability to make outreach to the people who feel alienated from his administration is severely limited. Modi woke up to the grim situation in Uttar Pradesh after four party MPs - Yaswant Singh, Savitri Bai Phule, Chote Lal Kharwar and Ashok Kumar Dohre - complained to leadership that Yogi government is not alive to the risk of growing loss of trust among Dalits for the BJP. They have complained about the government’s apathy towards the situation and pointed out how Yogi was rude towards them when they raised the issue of discrimination against Dalits with him. They have apprised Modi and Shah of the apprehensions among Dalits about BJP’s lack of commitment for reservation for Dalits. The increasing number of crimes being reported against Dalits and the Supreme Court judgment on SC/ST Atrocities Act has further worsened the apprehension. But it’s not merely Dalit MPs’ protest that has caused concern to Modi about Uttar Pradesh's political situation. As reported earlier by this writer on March 15, a team of  led by joint-general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale visited UP to assess the situation. Hosabale and his team had had meetings with Yogi, his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya and other senior party leaders. Hosabale had also alerted Yogi about the government’s lacklustre performance on several fronts. The RSS leaders were concerned, in particular, over the growing resentment among Dalits and also sections of the OBCs who have been core supporters of the BJP. Hosabale, considered close to Modi, had also spoken to the chief minister about the bureaucracy’s lackadaisical attitude that has left the state administration in disarray. The RSS leader asked the chief minister to rein in the bureaucracy. The RSS feedback on the Uttar Pradesh situation has alerted Modi and Amit Shah to the risk of UP being lost to the Opposition, the SP and the BSP, which is trying to unite to fight the BJP in 2019. It seems Modi’s patience with Yogi’s inept handling of administration is running thin. This is not the first time he had reprimanded him. In September last year, Modi and Shah took Yogi to task after women students protesting against sexual violence on the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) campus were beaten up by the police in a lathicharge. It happened on the day Modi was on a two-day visit to Varanasi, his home constituency, which caused a huge embarrassment to him besides giving a political handle to the opposition parties. It’s obvious, Yogi has failed to mend his ways and imbibe administrative acumen despite repeated warnings given by the BJP’s central leadership as well as senior RSS leaders.

439,Rohit Kumar,"“If not Modi, then who?” If I had been gifted a brick for every single time I have been asked that question over the past four years, I could have built a house by now. Asked with genuine sincerity most of the time, that question is a testament to the success of Narendra Modi’s carefully constructed political narrative of national indispensability. It is also a question that strikes at the very root and heart of a democracy, because implicit in the question is the assumption that in a country of 1.25 billion people, there is not a single other person in India with the capability and stature to be prime minister of India. “If not Modi, then who?” is usually followed by “Rahul Gandhi?” and a snigger. “Arvind Kejriwal? Who do we have as a national alternative, anyway?” A similar question was asked when Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister who steered the country through the first decisive decade and a half of its independence passed away. “If not Jawaharlal, then who?” But a successor was found, Lal Bahadur Shastri, whose memory and legacy continue to evoke respect half a decade after his death. That was 54 years ago. India has had 13 prime ministers since then. But out of all them, it is prime minister number 14 who has taken the cult of the personality to the next level. The cult of Modi, it would be safe to say, has overshadowed Indian politics almost more than anything else has these past four years. A cult, incidentally, is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary thus: “A system of religious veneration and devotion directed towards a particular figure or object.” “A relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or as imposing excessive control over members.” “A misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular thing.” One would be hard-pressed to find a more accurate definition of the Modi phenomenon. But the thing to remember about cults is that they have a shelf life. No matter how popular or charismatic a cult and its leader may be, sooner rather than later the appeal starts to wane and the shine begins to fade. The same thing is happening with the cult of Modi, too. The spectre of unemployment hangs heavy over India, thousands of jobless youth enter a comatose job market every day and the messianic promises that looked so appealing on billboards and the front pages of newspapers in the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections now seem a mockery. petrol diesel Modi Modi These are today a bad joke. Diesel prices have hit an all-time high and in a rapidly deteriorating social environment, women’s well-being and safety is more imperiled than ever. “But what is the alternative to Modi?” presupposes the assumption that India would lose a great deal if Modi is not the prime minister. Looking at this government’s track record over the past four years in the areas vis-à-vis the issues that it rode to power on (vikas, jobs, manufacturing and corruption), that assumption has turned out to be profoundly wrong. Nonetheless the question continues to be asked. Two responses come to mind. One is from veteran journalist Vinod Dua, who, in one of his increasingly popular   episodes wisely observed, “Alternatives emerge in a democracy. But in order for alternatives to emerge, democratic processes need to be strong.” And the second, thought-provoking response to this most weighty of all questions was offered by Shehla Rashid, a 30-year-old student leader, activist and former vice-president of JNUSU, at a gathering commemorating the martyrdom of Bhagat Singh and his comrades. Here are translated excerpts of her  : “The alternatives to Narendra Modi are Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Ashfaq and the Constitution of India. “If Bhagat Singh were alive today, what would he talk about? What issues would he work on? That's our alternative. The first thing he would fight for would be the right of every child in our country to receive education, and all that he or she needs to be in good health. He would fight to make sure that no child ever had to beg on the street again. ""He would also fight to abolish the tyranny of the Aadhaar and all the pain it has caused the poor. He would ask why women do not have more freedom in India today and why more women aren't part of the leadership of the country today. ""If Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev, Ramprasad Bismil, Ashfaq, and Chandrashekhar Azad were alive today, the question they would undoubtedly ask would be, 'Why are you taking out a rally in support of a rape?' (Referring to the brutal rape and murder of an eight-year-old child in Kathua, Kashmir.) ""If Bhagat Singh were alive today, he would ask why the youth are unemployed and why they don't have jobs. He would demand to know why the Nirav Modis and ultra-rich 1 per cent of India who have stolen so much of the nation's wealth have been given safe passage out of the country. ""Bhagat Singh spoke out against the tyranny of the 'Brown Englishman'. Well, the ‘Brown English’ are again oppressing us today and attacking our basic freedoms. ""If Bhagat Singh were alive today, he wouldn't just fight a government, he would fight the entire system that has kept India chained and impoverished. ""We have people like Bhagat Singh in India today. We have youth who are brave enough to come out on the streets and protest against authoritarianism get arrested. We have youth like my colleague Mohit who was suspended from JNU for raising questions about Najeeb's disappearance. ""We have youth like Jignesh Mewani who has raised important questions about the evils of caste. Those people and many more like them are the alternative you are looking for."" Rashid has a point. The great, mysterious alternative that India is on the lookout for is the same as it has always been - competent and compassionate citizens who care enough for the poor and disenfranchised of India to do whatever they can to remove the vast inequities that afflict them. It is an insult to the idea of India to assume that there are none of those people around. But with less than a year to go for the next General Election, we would do well to heed Vinod Dua’s advice… “For alternatives to emerge, democratic processes need to be strong.” As citizens of a democracy, we need to do what we can to safeguard those processes and institutions. We also need to start exploring how alternatives can work instead of listing all the reasons why they won’t, because if we don’t, then we will give in to the myth of the indispensable leader. That myth has let us down. It is high time we reposed our faith in its antithesis - genuine democracy. We have been lazy citizens. We have swallowed the rhyming two-liners, the fictitious WhatsApp forwards, and the alliterative acronyms. It is time for us now to do the hard work of asking tough questions about how those who ask for our votes, if they will actually serve the people who put them in power. We need to ask for details and plans, not rhymes and slogans. We need to start practicing democracy differently. We need to start voting for policies instead of just personalities. We need to examine very carefully what our candidates stand for, and then vote only for those who truly uphold the Constitution and its values. And that will take time and effort - something that we as an electorate have not been used to putting in.  “If not Modi, who?” The national alternative, it turns out, is good, old-fashioned, informed, secular democracy.",2018-04-10,"Brand Modi,Prime Minister,Modi,Lok Sabha polls 2019",What is the alternative to 'Modi cult'?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/lok-sabha-polls-2019-modi-prime-minister-brand-modi-jumla-vikas-sabka-saath-rahul-gandhi/story/1/23396.html
440,Ashok Upadhyay,"The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government acted upon the suggestion of its governor Ram Naik and added  by passing a resolution in the state Assembly. So, from now on, the UP government records and textbooks will refer to him as Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. The BJP has even coined a new slogan for Ambedkar Jayanti celebrations in Uttar Pradesh, that is, ""Baba Ji Ka Mission Adhura, BJP Kar Rahi Hai Pura (Ambedkar’s mission is incomplete, BJP is completing it)"". The BJP has also planned a 22-day celebration from April 14, ""Gram Swaraj Abhiyan"" to propagate Ambedkar’s message of village development, welfare of the poor and social justice. It seems the party is making every attempt to usurp the legacy of Dr BR Ambedkar - the latest being a statue of his which was vandalised recently, rebuilt and painted saffron in colour. 
 
 But does the party endorse what all this Dalit icon had said about Hindutva or Hindutva icon Vinayak Damodar Savarkar? Let’s take a look at 10 of Amebedkar's statements which may make the saffron party uncomfortable: 1) When Mahatma Gandhi requested Ambedkar to lend his support to the Temple Entry Bill, but the latter declined. Ambedkar wrote to Gandhi, ""I would like to assure the Mahatma that it is not the mere failure of Hindus and Hinduism which has produced in me the feelings of disgust and contempt. I am disgusted with Hindus and Hinduism because I am convinced that they cherish wrong ideals and lead a wrong social life. My quarrel with Hindus and Hinduism is not over the imperfections of their social conduct. It is much more fundamental. It is over their ideals."" 2) In response to Mahatma Gandhi's efforts to reclaim Dalits back into the Hindu fold, Ambedkar said, “A bitter thing cannot be made sweet. The taste of anything can be changed. But poison cannot be changed into nectar.” 3) In 1935, he publicly proclaimed, ""I was born a Hindu because I had no control over this, but I shall not die a Hindu."" 4) On October 14, 1956, while he converted to Buddhism in a grand ceremony in Nagpur, Ambedkar said: ""By discarding my ancient religion which stood for inequality and oppression, today I am reborn."" And one of the 22 oaths that he took on that day, and even asked those who converted like him to take, was: ""I thereby reject my old religion, Hinduism, which is detrimental to the prosperity of human kind and which discriminates between man and man and which treats me as inferior."" 5) Of the 22 vows of Dr Ambedkar the top three were: a) ""I shall have no faith in Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh nor shall I worship them."" b) ""I shall have no faith in Rama and Krishna who are believed to be incarnation of God nor shall I worship them."" c) ""I shall have no faith in 'Gauri', Ganapati and other gods and goddesses of Hindus nor shall I worship them."" 6) While comparing upper caste Hindus with Muslim communalists, he said, “Charged with this selfish idea of class domination, they take every move to exclude the lower classes of Hindus from wealth, education and power... This attitude of keeping education, wealth and power as a close preserve for themselves and refusing to share it, which the high caste Hindus have developed in their relation with the lower classes of Hindus, is sought to be extended by them to the Muslims. They want to exclude the Muslims from place and power, as they have done to the lower class Hindus. This trait of the high caste Hindus is the key to the understanding of their politics.” 7) Ambedkar did not differentiate between the flag-bearers of Hindutva and the Muslim League. He treated them as two faces of the same coin bent upon destroying India. He wrote: ""Strange as it may appear, Mr Savarkar and Mr Jinnah instead of being opposed to each other on the one nation versus two nations issue are in complete agreement about it. Both agree, not only agree, but insist that there are two nations in India - one the Muslim nation and the other Hindu nation."" 8) Hitting hard Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, who has acquired elevated status in saffron ecosphere, Dr Ambekdar did not mince any words. He wrote, “It must be said that Mr Savarkar's attitude is illogical, if not queer. Mr Savarkar admits that the Muslims are a separate nation. He concedes that they have a right to cultural autonomy. He allows them to have a national flag. Yet he opposes the demand of the Muslim nation for a separate national home. If he claims a national home for the Hindu nation, how can he refuse the claim of the Muslim nation for a national home?” 9) In Volume 7 of   , he raised the following questions. “What is the cause of the nausea which the Hindus have against beef-eating? Were the Hindus always opposed to beef-eating? If not, why did they develop such nausea against it? Were the Untouchables given to beef-eating from the very start? Why did they not give up beef-eating when it was abandoned by the Hindus? Were the untouchables always untouchables? Why should beef-eating give rise to untouchability at a later stage? If the Hindus were eating beef, when did they give it up?” Subsequently, he answered those questions in great detail. 10) Taking head on the right-wing forces, in his book,   Ambedkar wrote, “If Hindu Raj does become a fact, it will, no doubt, be the greatest calamity for this country. No matter what the Hindus say. Hinduism is a menace to liberty, equality and fraternity. On that account it is incompatible with democracy. Hindu Raj must be prevented at any cost.” (With inputs from Bijay Kumar.) ",2018-04-10,"Yogi Aditayanth,Uttar Pradesh,BR Ambedkar,BJP",10 things Ambedkar said in his lifetime that BJP wouldn't bear to hear,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bjp-appropiating-br-ambedkar-uttar-pradesh-yogi-aditayanth-dalits-hinduism-hindutva/story/1/23391.html
441,Gautam Benegal,"’s arrest in the blackbuck poaching case throws up an interesting insight on how a certain section of the public views high profile achievers who fall foul of the law. While some have been practically gloating that justice has been well-served, and risqe jokes on the internet are doing the rounds about how he will now provide “companionship” to Asaram Bapu with whom he shares a cell, with only a curtain dividing them, others have been vociferously demanding his release on the grounds that he has served society by his numerous selfless acts of charity. Public charity, according to them it would seem, should wipe his slate clean. Bollywood, which did not bother to come out even once during the recent farmers' march in Mumbai, has been on activism overdrive in its indignation, and closed its ranks. Comedian Kapil Sharma, a regular Twitterati posted a series of tweets condemning the judgement, pointing out Salman’s good deeds. Rajya Sabha MP Jaya Bachchan on Thursday expressed anguish with the Jodhpur court verdict against actor Salman Khan saying that the superstar should have been given a free pass for his humanitarian work. ""I feel bad. He should be given relief. He has done a lot of humanitarian work,"" Bachchan said. According to Shakti Kapoor, yesteryear's on-screen villain, “Salman doesn’t bother about the world. He has no complexes… his reputation of a brat is wrong.” Kapoor goes on to cite anecdotal evidence of Salman’s large-heartedness by recounting an episode in which he had helped out a needy old lady who was working in Filmistan studios with Rs 25,000 on the spot. He goes on to say how, when the lady finally came to thank Salman, he had put a finger on her lips which ""stopped her in her tracks"".  “I could see tears of gratitude in her eyes. Though there was no dialogue between them, I could see tears of gratitude in her eyes.” One can almost hear a hundred violin orchestra breaking out in the throes of full passion behind this scene. This is more or less a representative nutshell of the popular groundswell of support for Khan as expressed through reminisces and fond anecdotes. At this juncture, Salman Khan the humanitarian and philanthropist is being foregrounded with evangelical zeal by his followers, as well as his industry colleagues, who no doubt have considerable skin in the game considering their investments in his upcoming films. Whether it is playing with underprivileged kids or celebrating festivals with slum-dwellers or adopting a family, the last few days have seen the social media space replete with praise and breast-beating for ""bhai"". One has a sense of déjà vu. In March 2013, when Sanjay Dutt was arrested and got the verdict of five years' imprisonment, Bollywood had similarly closed its ranks. Arshad Warsi, who co-starred with Dutt in the blockbuster  series, tweeted: ""I am numb, I don't know what to say. Sanjay Dutt is not a criminal. This is too harsh a decision."" Hrithik Roshan, Dutt's co-star in  and  , tweeted: ""I cannot comprehend. I know d law is d LAW. But I can bet my Life 2 say that Sanju sir doesn't deserve this! D most loved man!i stand for Sanjay dutt"" ( ). Arjun Rampal tweeted, ""My heart goes out to Sanju and his family. Just numbed by the news."" Karan Johar, who produced  , tweeted, ""I am truly shattered to hear of Sanju's sentence... the nicest guy I have known just doesn’t deserve this... my heart goes out to him."" Mahesh Bhatt, who worked with Dutt in films like  ,  and  , tweeted: ""Heart Broken: Just heard that Sanjay Dutt has to go to jail for five years. I expected mercy. Alas, it did not happen."" Compare this with Hollywood’s response to the Harvey Weinstein scandal. As allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein, the movie mogul surfaced, they were initially met with a deafening silence from A-list stars. A couple of days after   reported that Weinstein had reached at least eight legal settlements with women dating back decades, only a handful of entertainment industry figures stepped up to condemn the man who long held the power to make or break careers. Rose McGowan, who had settled a harassment case against Weinstein in 1997, said she had been hoping fellow actresses would speak out publicly.  ""Ladies of Hollywood, where are you?"" she tweeted, ""Ladies of Hollywood, your silence is deafening."" Yet, there were notable exceptions. Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Lawrence and George Clooney among others did speak up against Weinstein. As the #MeToo movement gained momentum in Hollywood following the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations, Woody Allen's adopted daughter and victim Dylan Farrow asked pointedly in a   op-ed in December, ""Why has the #MeToo revolution spared Woody Allen?"" Farrow’s words turned the tide. Prominent actors like Susan Sarandon, Rebecca Hall, and Greta Gerwig pledged never to work with Woody Allen ever again. When actor Anthony Rapp accused acclaimed House of Cards star Kevin Spacey (who had come out and declared himself gay), saying he was sexually harassed by Spacey at the age of 14, Hollywood made it clear to Spacey that “hiding under the rainbow” was no excuse for sexual misconduct. There is no such crisis of conscience in Bollywood. Whether it is sexual misconduct, wife-beating, or outright crimes that are listed in the IPC, Bollywood is one large family that looks after its own, much like a traditional joint family with too many skeletons in the closet, going back for generations. These are left to our filmi gossip magazines, to speculate upon salaciously to tingle the readers’ and fans’ tastebuds, but never to delve into seriously, never to introspect. Such soul-searching would throw up not only uncomfortable facts about the idols we rush to take selfies, but also about our own infantile need to view them either as heroes or villains - a projection of their on-screen personas into the real world, to vicariously live through them the lifestyles we both envy and moralistically judge. ",2018-04-07,"Bollywood,Blackbuck poaching verdict,Salman Khan,Salman Khan",Why Bollywood is guilty of normalising crimes and glorifying criminals,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/salman-khan-blackbuck-poaching-verdict-bollywood-shame-hum-saath-saath-hain-sanjay-dutt/story/1/23338.html

It seemingly brought to a close an imbroglio dating back to 1892 and 1924 vintage agreements, held to be “water sharing were not political arrangements but entered into in public interest”. Even while the share of Karnataka was enhanced by 14.75 thousand million cubic (TMC) feet, tucking into the share of Tamil Nadu, to provide for 4.75 TMC to Karnakata towards the “increased and increasing needs of the city’s drinking water and industrial requirements"", the SC conceded to the clamour from Tamil Nadu for a  , albeit christened as a “scheme”. Even 10 TMC was premised on the “ground water resources in the Tamil Nadu Cauvery basin”. While the farmers in Tamil Nadu welcomed the Cauvery Management Board, their Karnataka brethren hailed ""excess"" as ""success"". There were kudos for the top court for its astutely crafted verdict while walking a tight rope of emotional tug of war, as if the national flag was fluttering in the words. The shares of Kerala and Puducherry remained undisturbed in an ""arrangement"" to last 15 years. We did not factor in the parochial interests of our politicians, on party lines, camouflaged as state interests. There is absolutely no national outlook in the responses we have seen, reflecting the apex court’s pronouncement that ""water was a national asset and no one state can claim a monopoly"". Instead, the forthcoming Karnataka Assembly elections on May 12, has come as a huge spoilsport, which in an ideal political-legal sphere, it ought not to have been. Karnataka is seeking to torpedo the Cauvery Management Board within the six-week timeline. The language each has employed is meant to placate their ""bases""/""base instincts"".

What is going on? Where are we heading as a constitutionally abiding nation compelled to follow the Supreme Court verdict as the law of the land under Article 141 of the Constitution of India? Tamil Nadu is known to be a politically alive state. It is in its very DNA. Unfortunately, this time around, substance in the political rhetoric has added menace. The central government is accused of partisanship in playing politics since it is seen to be unwilling to honour the Cauvery verdict. Already, Karnataka chief minister Siddaramiah has let the cat among the pigeons by his recommendation to the central government to recognise Lingayats as a minority religion in the state (constitutionally, a wobbly recommendation). Be that as it may, the BJP cannot afford to burn the bridges on the sensitive Cauvery water-sharing? The Modi administration may have hit upon the circuitous route by delaying to constitute the Cauvery Management Board. It does appear as if the BJP is caught in a bind and would not like to be seen as conceding to form the board, on its own, and therefore is seeking to gain time beyond May 12, by which time Karnataka voters may have made their choice.

443,Harmeet Shah Singh,"A British Sikh Report (BSR) launched in the UK Parliament five years ago found 95 per cent of the members of the tiny minority were proud of being born or living in Britain. ""It is great to see a proactive approach being taken by the British Sikh community to highlight their concerns, wants and needs in such a comprehensive way,''   quoted Paul Uppal, then a Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South West, as saying. ""The British Sikh community has made and continues to make a huge contribution to our nation,"" noted Labour leader Ed Miliband in his assessment of the BSR. The Sikh diaspora makes up a fraction - 430,000 - of the UK's total population of around 66 million. Punjab's Maharaja Duleep Singh, who was exiled in 1849 after the Anglo-Sikh wars, was the first recorded Sikh settler in Britain. Almost a hundred years later, a number of Sikhs from Punjab moved to the UK for industrial employment. Some years later, they were joined by the community counterparts from East Africa. Another set of migration took place in the 1980s-1990s during the unrest in Punjab. The United Kingdom is the fourth-largest inward investor in India, after Mauritius, Singapore and Japan, with a cumulative equity investment of $24.37 billion between April 2000 and December 2016, according to a brief on foreign relations posted on the MEA's website. This, the brief says, accounts for around seven percent of all foreign direct investment into India. At the same time, India continues to be the third-largest investor in the UK and emerged as the second-largest international job creator in the UK. Defence, education and science and technology are other pillars of the bilateral relationship. Yet, hawks in New Delhi establishment rolled a story out in none other than a leading business daily that ""Sikh extremism"" in the UK will ""figure high"" on prime minister Narendra Modi's agenda when he meets his British counterpart Theresa May in London later this month. The story was couched in a characteristic jargon that makes no distinction between extremism, radicalisation and terrorism on the one hand and activism on the other. It was meant to be that way. Words were thrown like popcorn on purpose. ""India is likely to seek strong action over reported growth in Sikh extremism in the United Kingdom, just as in Canada and Australia,"" the   declared.  Action? What action? And for what? In 2015, PM Modi shared a dossier with the then UK prime minister, David Cameron, alleging ""Sikh radicalisation"" in Britain. For domestic media back home, every complaint that our country now increasingly tends to make to other nations about communities and people makes up a banner headline over other news. For the British though, it wasn't fun. The Leeds university took up the matter as a research subject. Its findings flew straight into the face of the so-called dossier. ""This research highlights that Sikhs have no conflict with Britain or the West. There is much unresolved trauma in the Sikh community around the events of 1984 which continues to drive many Sikhs to activism,"" the Leeds  , released November last year, found. ""However, in terms of incidents and issues, the most frequently reported incidents of violence involving Sikhs in Britain have taken place against other Sikhs."" In line with the BSR report of 2013, the study found much Sikh activism in Britain contributed positively to the integration agenda, particularly in the form of humanitarian relief. The research underscored Sikh role during natural disasters, ""such as floods in Somerset and Hebden Bridge, and incidents such as the Grenfell Tower fire, where members of the public required support"". Unlike the popcorn usage prevalent in India, the survey report made a clear distinction between activism and radicalisation. And it traced the root of the British Sikh activism to the devastating events of 1984, starting from Operation Blue Star to the massacre of thousands of Sikhs in the streets of New Delhi and other major cities of India for at least half-a-week after the assassination of then PM Indira Gandhi. Thirty four years on, no perpetrator of the gory killings of 1984 has been punished by the Indian state. Evidence was destroyed purposely during the first of the series of investigations. Thirty-four years means a generation-and-a-half. Punjab and the Sikhs of India have since moved on. When you drive into the Sikh majority state, from Chandigarh right up to Amritsar, there's absolutely no unease in the air. No separatism in popular psyche, no major Hindu-Sikh tensions, let alone terrorism. Drive deeper into towns and villages of Punjab and you'll find many houses in rows padlocked. Whosoever has the resources and the means is moving out to either Canada, the United States, Europe or to Australia and New Zealand. This is a purely economic migration. The events of 1984 are not a part of regular public discourse in Punjab. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. In a bigger culture where effigies of a mythological demon king, Ravan, are burnt every year, you cannot expect an entire community to forget mass murders and public lynchings of its members in 34 years. It's just that the theatre of struggle for justice has moved. It has moved from Punjab and Delhi to the developed world. It has moved to where Sikhs now share power - Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Their small size and difficult history aside, the community has established itself as a powerbroker in the international community. The Sikhs in those countries have risen through the ranks - from farm labourers, lorry drivers to mayors, police chiefs, lawmakers and ministers. And with that phenomenal rise, they took up 1984 vociferously to international forums. Just last year, the Ontario legislature in Canada passed a motion calling the 1984 anti-Sikh violence a ""genocide"", a politically-charged term. Exactly a month before   reported the Sikh subject topping Modi's agenda with the UK prime minister, Britain promised to discuss with him the alleged persecution of Christians and the Sikhs in India during his April visit. This, after British MPs raised the demand that the matter be taken up with Modi on a priority. ""My frequent jousting partner, the honorable member for West Dunbartonshire (Martin Docherty-Hughes), alluded to a consular case that we continue to work closely on,"" a   quoted British foreign-office minister for Asia Mark Field as saying. ""He made some profound points about prime minister Modi and about Christian and Sikh minorities in India. We will do our best to raise some of those in an appropriate manner at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in mid-April to ensure that Parliament’s voice is properly heard.” The bloodshed of 1984 in an India governed by the Congress party is now seen as the seed of right-wing and aggressive majoritarianism that's gaining a firm foothold in the country under the BJP rule. Local party politics is fading out of the bigger picture. The questions instead are being raised internationally about the Indian state and its commitment to its secular Constitution. India's ties with the Sikh diaspora are set to sink further and strain its relations with the countries like the UK, Canada, Australia or a Trump-less US in the future if powers in New Delhi didn't settle 1984 once and for all.

444,Arunoday Majumder,"The BJP's embarassing defeat in the Gorakhpur and Phulphur by-elections has triggered several explanations. Whatever be the reason this time, it is hard to deny that the by-poll results have taken the sheen off the BJP's victory in the Northeast. I have earlier argued that the win in Tripura was like the proverbial   because it was an ideological victory as well. But now the saffron party is at palpable risk of cutting a sorry figure in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. It may keep the icing, but lose the cake. The BJP has managed a meagre win in the Gujarat Assembly elections. It has lost parliamentary seats in Ajmer and Alwar by-polls in Rajasthan. It has lost in Araria in Bihar too. In poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, the BJP faces serious anti-incumbency. So the saffron party may be spreading itself thin.  Yet praise must be heaped on Akhilesh Yadav. The young man hawked like David to upstage Goliath. His win has reactivated efforts towards a ""mahagathbandhan"" or grand alliance against the BJP. His strategy to tie-up with arch-rival BSP reminds that Uttar Pradesh is the literary playground of the Mahabharata too. It is not just sweet home to the Ramayana as the BJP likes to believe. In terms of allying, Krishna and Rama are as different as chalk and cheese because the two characters differ in their understandings of ""dharma"". So it is no coincidence that the Mahabharata offers a dharmic discourse which is interpretive and complex. But the Ramayana offers one that is prescriptive and dangerously simple. Last November witnessed a crucial statement in Saifai - the birthplace of SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh. His son Akhilesh Yadav was reported to have commissioned   in the Rathangapani pose. It was further reported that the plan is to unveil the mammoth idol before the next Lok Sabha elections. Such a symbol is replete with meanings in cultural India. First, the statue of Krishna with the chariot-wheel-in-hand (Rathangapani - ""rath"" or chariot plus ""anga"" or part plus ""pani"" or hand) is an allusion to the only instance in Kurukshetra when the superhuman took up weapon to challenge the invincible Bhishma. Akhilesh has made his intention towards the BJP clear with the selection of Krishna in the chariot-wheel-in-hand posture instead of the flute-in-hand form. Second, it is to (re)introduce an alternate narrative in the Hindi heartland which is routinely bombarded with the Ram temple-in-Ayodhya obsession. Third, it is to assert lineage to the mighty Krishna - divine star of the Yadav clan. Fourth, it is to signal truce between father and son. Few will disagree that the bitter feud between Mulayam and Akhilesh allowed the BJP to post a spectacular victory in the Uttar Pradesh election just a year back. That the senior Yadav did not veto the alliance with Mayawati is hint that the gesture has yielded result. At the heart of such entente is a Mahabharata-inspired understanding of dharma. Dharma is still translated as ""religion"" in India, thanks to the continued colonisation of culture and mind. But dharma is best translated as ""contextual duty"", that is, circumstantial action. Dharma is undertaken after the actor has interpreted it as appropriate to the occasion. So inherent in dharma is a high degree of flexibility. This is why it is complex and makes for hair-splitting analysis. For instance: the alliance between Krishna, Drupada and the Pandava (minus the singular case of Arjuna); and that between Bhishma, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, Vidur, Shalya, Karna, Aswathama, Shakuni and the Kaurava are not naturally given. Each pact is based on cumulative circumstances and their unique interpretation by the actor who enters into it. War creates unlikely proximities in the Mahabharata and they remain open to criticism. Although Kurukshetra is now in neighbouring Haryana yet fabled Hastinapur - where it all began - is very much in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. Akhilesh and Mayawati know that their alliance too is a case study of ""necessity is the mother of invention"". The SP and the BSP have social bases that are antagonistic. Yadavs are land-owning dominant castes of Uttar Pradesh and form the electoral base of the SP. On the other hand, scheduled castes form the voter base of the BSP. They are locked in a political-economic battle with the Yadavs for a fair share of the agrarian pie. Both are aware that theirs is a dharmic unity without any lasting chemistry. It is a chance romance when and where the BJP appears menacing. Just like coalition partners in Kurukshetra, it is only the dark clouds of war that keep the Bhatija-Bua unity. Such lack of internal logic of alliance means that suspicion will be a constant in the relationship. That BSP has backtracked on vote transfer to SP in the  is testimony to this. Unlike the dharmic suppleness that Akhilesh has exhibited, the BJP suffers from an authoritarian understanding of dharma. It comprehends dharma as a standard which Rama erects via his exploits in the dominant version of Ramayana. The televised Ramayana of the late 1980s is a rough equivalent of this oversimplified narrative. Lord Rama is ""maryada purushottam"" here and his conduct is prescribed duty across space-time. So associates of such omnipotent authority can only be vassals like Sugriva and Vibhishana. And vassals in the Ramayana cannot question the hero unlike allies in the Mahabharata. This has obvious repercussions.   The Modi-Shah duo in the BJP operates as an authoritarian combine much to the chagrin of allies. As my first editor Rajdeep Sardesai   ""Today, it isn’t the Hindutva tag of the BJP which is leading to its isolation, but the anxiety in the Opposition that a Modi-Shah-led BJP is a ruthless election machine that will eventually devour every other political party. That even the Shiv Sena, the original Hindutva ally, has perhaps been the most vociferous in criticising the BJP leadership, is further evidence of the fact that battlelines are being drawn this time over personalities rather than ideology."" The problem may aggravate if the BJP continues to falter in the Hindu-Hindi hinterland and no SOS call for help is returned. The saffron party will benefit if it follows Akhilesh and takes to the Mahabharata. Another section which will benefit from the great epic is Anglophone India. This club should note that the ethnocentric binary of reason-dharma since ""civilising mission"" cannot fashion the Trojan key to outsmart the BJP. The device is already there in the cultural memory of India. A warning is must, however. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are excellent strategists. Time and again they have done a Virat Kohli on the electoral pitch and stayed ahead of analysts.",2018-04-05,"SP-BSP,UP by-poll results,Lok Sabha elections 2019,BJP",Why Akhilesh Yadav is invoking Mahabharata in UP with a Krishna statue,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bjp-akhilesh-yadav-krishna-secret-statue-sp-bsp-ram-temple-lok-sabha-2019-up-by-poll-debacle/story/1/23305.html
445,Manoj Chaurasia,"The BJP can’t just think of retaining power at the Centre without the support of Bihar, but it has already made two mistakes in quick succession. It had committed the first mistake by going mysteriously silent over the observations made by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat with regard to reservations during the 2015 Assembly polls in Bihar. By the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi could open his mouth and issue a clarification, it was all over - Bihar had gone to the three-party mahagathbandhan or grand alliance. It’s another issue that the BJP managed to grab power 20 months later. The current issue of debate in Bihar is that the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre has committed the blunder by reacting rather late to the  by the Supreme Court, which ruled ""no arrest can be made under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act without prior permission"". This is bound to have serious political repercussions in the days to come.   With the next Lok Sabha polls barely a year away and caste being a major issue in the elections, the government should have acted fast, but it rushed to file review petition when Dalits had already decided to express their anger. Even BJP’s allies have supported the Dalit protests saying it was “genuine”, indicating the seriousness of the situation in the NDA camp. “The Bharat bandh and protests on the streets were expected, as Dalits and tribal communities in the country are angry and disappointed,” said Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) parliamentary board chairman Chirag Paswan, son of Ram Vilas Paswan. The JD(U), BJP’s another ally, on the other hand, led a delegation of state lawmakers to the Bihar governor, demanding cancellation of order as passed by the SC with regard to the SC/ST Act. Both these parties draw its strength from the Dalit community. While Dalits have been the main vote-bank of the LJP headed by Ram Vilas Paswan, the JD(U) too has recently wooed this vast community by constituting a Mahadalit Commission to work for their economic and social betterment. Their anger as seen during the Bharat bandh, thus, is worrying the NDA allies who apprehend they are bound to sink if the Centre didn’t raise the issue forcefully before the apex court. As per 2011 Census, Dalits constitute a significant 16 per cent of Bihar’s 104 million population, which amply indicates their political strength. The “softness” of the BJP towards this major issue, thus, could ultimately force its two key allies to dump the NDA as they wound not like to risk their political career. Given the situation, the BJP could pay a heavy price in the next polls, experts say. The BJP has already seen it from a close when it lost the power by whisker during the 2015 state elections for failing to give clarifications over reservation on time. Things were working in favour of the BJP until the RSS chief committed the mistake of favouring a review of country’s existing reservation policy. The comments were immediately lapped up by RJD chief Lalu Prasad who made it an issue, telling the vast backward and Dalit community as to how the BJP was conspiring to scrap the reservation of the socially marginalised castes. The issue ultimately united the vast Dalits, backwards and extremely backward castes who were divided into various segments.  This ultimately spoiled the   which ended up winning only 58 seats in 243-member Bihar Assembly. That all is surely not well for the NDA is underlined from that fact that the Dalit community in Bihar is already said to be seething with anger over the way local courts, of late, acquitted all the accused persons involved in at least six Dalit massacre cases. It all began in March 2009 when a trial court in Jehanabad district   for “lack of evidence” in Narayanpur massacre in which 11 Dalits had been gunned down by banned Ranvir Sena, a private militia of upper caste landlords. Again in April 2012, the Patna High Court   of shooting dead 21 Dalits at Bathani Tola for lack of evidence. The same accused persons had earlier been convicted by the lower court and even sentenced - three were handed out death whereas the rest were awarded life imprisonment. Same happened with all the 11  , who all were acquitted by the Patna High Court in March 2013 for lack of evidence. Here in this case too, all the 10 victims were Dalits who were killed in cold blood in Bhojpur district in 1998. Again, the   nine out of total 10 accused in the killing of 32 Dalit villagers at Miyanpur village in Aurangabad district in 2000. The acquittal came in July 2013 and the reason for it was the same - lack of evidence.  came in the Laxmanpur-Bathe massacre in which all the 26 accused charged with the massacre of 58 Dalit villagers were acquitted by the Patna High Court for lack of evidence. The blood-curdling incident had taken place in Jehanbad district in December 1998. After years-long trial, the Patna High Court finally acquitted all the 26 accused persons in October 2013 for lack of evidence. All the accused persons had earlier been convicted by a local court - 16 of them were handed out death sentence whereas the rest were awarded life term. Again, a local court in January 2015   in the 1999 massacre of 23 Dalits at Shankar Bigha village in Jehanabad district for lack of evidence. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation from all sections after which then governor Sundar Singh Bhandari had recommended for President’s rule in Bihar although it didn’t last long. What is strange is that all the acquittals came in between 2009 and 2015 when Nitish Kumar-led NDA government remained in power in Bihar, and the message has not gone down well within the Dalit community. This surely could mar the prospects of the NDA in the coming polls. “The acquittals, in fact, are massacre of justice. It says there are no takers for the Dalit people in the state. The fact is that Dalits were killed in all the massacres and it’s also a fact that all the accused walked free. So who killed Dalits? The court should have answered this question,” said a Dalit leader who didn't wish to be named.",2018-04-06,"SC/ST Atrocities Act,Caste Discrimination,Bihar,Dalit atrocities",How the Dalit issue could throw a spanner in BJP's Bihar game plan,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bihar-dalit-atrocities-caste-discrimination-sc-st-atrocities-act-bjp-nda-nitish-kumar/story/1/23314.html
446,Praveen Shekhar,"In a major blow to 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind   and his networks, the US has declared Milli Muslim League (MML), the political front of Jamaat-ud Dawa, as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO).  The United States has added the Milli Muslim League (MML) and Tehreek-e-Azadi-e-Kashmir (TAJK) to its list of foreign terrorist organisations, reasoning that both were fronts for the banned terrorist outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). ""The aliases - MML and TAJK - have been added to LeT’s designations as an FTO under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order 13224,"" the US State Department website said. Significantly, the United States designating MML as FTO comes at a time when several political parties have started registering themselves for the general elections to be held in Pakistan in July. Clearly, the MML will face difficulties in registering itself as a political party with the Pakistani Election Commission. This action by the United States also derives importance from the fact that Pakistan has always denied associating Hafiz Saeed and his activities with ""terrorism"". In fact, it has been providing safe haven and protection to the Mumbai attack mastermind. The US action also affirms India's stand that those perpetrating terrorism are present in Pakistan, getting protection from the Pakistan Army, the ISI and the Pakistan government. The US knows and understands very well that Pakistan gives shelter, training and arms to the terrorist organisations. The huge hideouts of these terrorist outfits present in Pakistan themselves remain a headache for America. The US finds itself in a fix over criticism coming from the whole world that despite knowing about Pakistan’s track record in supporting terrorists, it gives Pakistan much leverage in the form of heavy military and financial support while Pakistan uses it to spread terrorism, especially against India. On several occasions India has raised its objections before the US and asked it to take strict action against Pakistan. Now apart from the MML, the US has also included Tehreek-e-Azadi-e-Kashmir (TAJK) in the list of terrorist groups.  It is well known that no terrorist organisation can carry out its activities without the consent of the Pakistani government and its army. Pakistan had, in fact, refused to accept Hafiz Saeed as a terrorist. It will now be worthwhile to see how Pakistan protects terrorists like Hafiz Saeed after the US action. It was in 1980s that Hafiz Saeed had formed the Laskhar-e-Taiba with the objective to deal with Soviet troops in Afghanistan. Later, Pakistan started using it in Kashmir against India. It was LeT that had carried out attacks on Indian Parliament and in Mumbai. The LeT was designated as a foreign terrorist organisation and specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) group on December 26, 2001. Its leader, Saeed, is also designated as an SDGT. Although Pakistan had banned the LeT, it was allowed to keep functioning in its new avatar as Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD). Later, the JuD was also declared a terrorist organisation by the US and the United Nations. It is not hidden from anyone that Hafiz Saeed has managed to continue running his terrorist activities by creating a new organisation with new names every time. In January 2017, LeT began operating under the name of TAJK. Under this name, the LeT has engaged in inciting terrorism, as well as recruiting and fundraising. In August 2017, Saeed created the MML to serve as a political front for the group. The US designating Milli Muslim League (MML), the political front of Hafiz Saeed-led Jamaat-ud Dawa, as a foreign terrorist organisation is major move ahead of the general elections in Pakistan. MML’s foray into politics came about last year when it made an impressive show at Lahore's NA-120 by-election, where a candidate backed by it gained the fourth place. Candidates backed by the party - since it is yet to be registered as a political party - have made similar gains in subsequent by-elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  The US’s action comes as a shot in the arm of India. Reacting to the US move, an MEA spokesperson said: “India welcomes the action taken by the US. It vindicates India’s position that Pakistan has not taken effective action against terrorist groups and individuals. “It is also cognisance of the fact that terrorist individuals and entities are allowed to change names and continue to operate freely from territory under Pakistan’s control. The designation is a rejection of the attempts being made in Pakistan to mainstream terrorist individuals and entities; and highlights Pakistan’s failure to fulfil its international obligation to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries, and disrupt terror financing,” the spokesperson pointed out.",2018-04-06,"Pakistan,Mumbai Attack,Terrorism,Milli Muslim League",What US designating Hafiz Saeed's Milli Muslim League as terrorist outfit means for India,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/hafiz-saeed-milli-muslim-league-terrorism-mumbai-attack-pakistan/story/1/23312.html
447,Seema Guha,"Nepal's Prime Minister   on Friday on a three-day state visit where a grand welcome awaits him, as India strives to repair damaged ties with the Himalayan nation. This will be Oli’s first visit abroad since taking office in February 15. Considering the close economic and cultural ties between the two neighbours, New Delhi has always been the first stop for Nepal PMs. But this time around, India has already realised Oli is on a politically strong wicket and has to be handled with kid gloves. Having won the national elections with an overwhelming majority, Oli is brimming with confidence and is committed to ensure that Nepal stands its ground on all bilateral matters. The Communists believe that the election mandate is to ensure that tiny Nepal, sandwiched between Asian giants India and China, is not dictated by either side. A confident Nepal now feels that foreign powers, big or small, should not interfere in its domestic affairs. It is not just India which is seen as poking its nose into Nepal’s internal issues, but western diplomats too have been cautioned against constantly raising internal issues. ""We do not want animosity with any country. But we want to tell the world that we are capable of sorting out our own domestic issues, and all we want from them is goodwill and support,’’ Nepal’s articulate foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali said in an interview to Kathmandu’s English weekly  . During Oli’s first term as prime minister, India-Nepal ties had reached its lowest point with New Delhi batting for the Indian-origin Madhesis who it said had been given short shrift in the new Republican Constitution, and imposed a blockcade to put pressure on Oli. New Delhi, however, denies it, saying truckers refused to ply because of the Madhesi protests. Whatever India may say now, the fact is that it did not help the cause of the Madhesis. It was a foolish move that made people angry. ""The blockade instilled confidence in us that we can overcome any challenge,"" the foreign minister said in the same interview. The economic blockade led to untold sufferings for the people of Nepal both in the hills and the Terai region. Anti-India sentiments were high and when Oli turned to China for help, the nation backed him. Oli played the China card and signed a landmark trade and transit agreement in an attempt to dilute its dependence on India. The terrain between China and Nepal is tough and building road and railtracks there is not easy. Although China has the expertise to do build both road and rail links connecting western parts of Tibet to Kathmandu, not much has moved. ""It was mainly symbolic,"" Swarnim Wagle, vice-chairman of Nepal’s planning commission, said recently. He is a member of the pro-India Nepali Congress. However, those projects will now again be taken up with renewed vigour by the Oli government. Nepal has also joined President Xi Jinping’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative and is expected to formalise projects under the scheme in the coming months. Apart from rail tracks, hydel projects and transmission lines are also on the agenda for Nepal. Soon after the economic blockade, Oli was replaced as the prime minister. Here too the people of Nepal suspected India's hand. But during the elections, India kept a lowprofile, having realised that Nepalese sentiments were turning against India in what people perceived as high-handed interference by New Delhi. Now, however, the equation seems to be gradually changing. The Modi government has realised its mistake and is pushing back against China’s growing clout in Nepal. Soon after the elections results were out, Prime Minister Modi spoke to Oli twice on phone. The invitation to visit India was made by the PM during a phone conversation. External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj travelled to Nepal in the beginning of February and met not just Oli, but Prachanda and other leaders as well. All this happened much before Oli took office. During Oli’s visit, not many agreements are likely to be signed according to the foreign minister, but India is expected to announce a handsome financial package for Nepal. Ongoing projects like earthquake reconstruction, which was part of the development assistance to Nepal, will be reviewed and possibly expanded. Reconvening of the SAARC Summit is also likely to be raised by Oli. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who was in Kathmandu in March, had asked Nepal to convince New Delhi not to allow bilateral differences to hold up the summit. This was the first bilateral visit of a Pakistani prime minister to Kathmandu in over two decades.The 2016 SAARC meet was scrapped following India’s decision to boycott the event following the terror attacks in Uri and Pathankot airforce station. Pakistan is trying to persuade SAARC member states to get New Delhi to relent. When Sri Lanka’s President Maithripala Sirisena was in Islamabad, he was also asked by Abbasi to take up the matter with Prime Minister Modi. Much will depend on how India-Pakistan bilateral ties pan out. It is time for Prime Minister Modi to re-focus on his neighbourhood policy, especially when China is clearly spreading its wings in India’s neighbourhod. Pakistan, China’s close friend is also activating its neighbourhood diplomacy. Prime Minister Abbasi was in Nepal while his army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa was in Male recently, emphasising friendship between the two brotherly Muslim neighbouring nations. India needs to reclaim lost ground in the neighbourhood and PM Oli's visit may prove to be the perfect start to that.",2018-04-04,"Modi,KP Sharma Oli,Nepal PM visit,India-Nepal ties",Why Nepal wants foreign powers to stay away from its domestic affairs,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/nepal-pm-kp-sharma-oli-india-visit-modi-india-nepal-ties-economic-blockade-madhesis-saarc-summit/story/1/23263.html
448,Pradyumna Jairam,"As someone who has been associated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) system of evaluation as a student and a teacher, I can vouch for the fact that both students and teachers place a great deal of significance on the outcome of the board exams. For students, they are a reflection (although not a wholly correct one) of their aptitude and decide which college they will be studying in. For the teachers, it is the end of a year-long journey of imparting knowledge of the text, which the students memorise. I say this because while there are many teachers in the schools who adopt out-of-the-box and interactive teaching methods, they are all eventually bogged down by the examination and “ ”, where correct answers to the questions asked in the board exams are invariably found in the textbooks prescribed either by the NCERT or the CISCE (for the ISC/ICSE board). Students taking the board exams are thus more interested in “what is to be remembered” from the text, and teachers spend most of the year reinforcing concepts through practice tests and mock exams before the final exam in March. This leads us to believe that an exam that is accorded such a high degree of importance by students, teachers and parents ought to be conducted in the most efficient manner, in order to avoid glitches. Thus, what happened last week, with the  of the CBSE class 10 mathematics and class 12 economics papers, came as a shock to the three stakeholders listed above. Students, of course, had every reason to feel outraged, their final exams of the year interrupted and postponed for no fault of their own. The government’s response was to  the three people accused of leaking the papers in Delhi’s Bawana, order a re-test for the economics paper, and finally suspend one bureaucrat from the CBSE. All of these actions point to an unwillingness to address the rot that is the broader secondary school education system of India. These administrative steps are mere stop-gaps and offer short term relief to students, while there are no checks in place to ensure such a fiasco does not take place again. In short, these are not student-friendly steps. Almost criminally, the most important stakeholders have been left out of a long-term solution. We must, therefore, understand where in the system the problem lies. For starters, it is the CBSE itself. While its initial mandate was to conduct and supervise examinations for classes 10 and 12, known popularly as the board exams, its list of responsibilities has been steadily increasing. This can be evidenced by the fact that it was tasked with conducting the national eligibility test, which is used to grant junior research fellowships and university professorships (clearing this exam is now a prerequisite). So many examinations only increase the board’s burden, necessitating an increase in manpower and resulting in rising workload. As its name suggests, for the board of secondary education, its primary responsibility lies in conducting school exams. As of 2017, there were 19,316 schools in India, and 211 overseas, which were affiliated with the board, and depended on it to hold error-free examinations. The CBSE is not a creation of an act of Parliament, as such it is not an autonomous institution. Finally, those who administer the board's functions are not educators, but civil servants appointed by governments. For example, the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), the body that produces textbooks for CBSE schools, had renowned educationist Krishna Kumar as its chairperson in 2005. The new curriculum framework and revamped textbooks, particularly of the social sciences, were a welcome change for students and teachers as more contemporary and relevant history was added. Kumar is one of the most prolific scholars on the status of education in India, and thus the appointment of an educator to the highest rank in an educational body had its benefits. Technological innovations have been suggested as remedies to solve the problem of leaks. However, technology is not foolproof, and does not address the wider problems in the board. Thus, the board needs to acquire autonomous status, and must be placed under the stewardship of educators, preferably at the school level. This is because they are aware of the pressures associated with the board exam. They not only prepare students throughout the year for excelling at the papers, but also have to perform other roles as invigilators and examiners, which eats into their summer vacation. Moreover, the responsibility for the current leak must be taken by higher-ups in not just the CBSE, but also the ministry of human resources and development. Not just secretaries, but also the minister and minister of state must be held accountable in order to provide more accountability, and show students that their needs and priorities should be at the top of the government’s agenda, and that any violation will be dealt with severely. Finally, students can learn something from this farcical development. It has exposed them to one of the many rots in India’s education system. While universities are being crippled in various ways, and students agitate for spaces of dissent and equality, school students have seen first hand how the system has affected them. Their anger can only bode well for the future, because as aware citizens they now know how governments have neglected the education system. These young citizens can raise their voices for a better system for their juniors. A word of caution for them: the problem is not just limited to India, but a part of the global concerns in secondary and higher education. It as prevalent in the “enlightened first world”, where many students will pursue their higher studies. Beware, a crisis is not far away just because it does not affect you in the present. It will creep up on you when you least expect it.

Why do these two cases worry Opposition leaders to an extent that they are prepared to go through the pretence of an impeachment motion against the CJI even though they know it will fall at the first hurdle? If, for example, the  gathers the minimum required signatures of MPs in the Rajya Sabha (50) and the Lok Sabha (100), the chairperson of the upper house, vice-president Venkaiah Naidu, and the Speaker in the lower house, Sumitra Mahajan, can reject the motion at their discretion. In the improbable event they don't, a three-member committee has to be formed to probe the charges against the CJI, prove those charges beyond doubt and present its findings to the two houses. A two-thirds majority in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha is necessary for the impeachment process to be successful. Since the motion is pre-ordained to fail, turn to the real reason why the Congress, Left, NCP and other Opposition parties want to go through this theatre of the absurd. Ever since CJI Misra indicated a few months ago that he would like to fast-track the Ram Mandir-Ayodhya hearings, alarm bells began ringing in 10 Janpath and 12 Tughlak Lane. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi know that a Supreme Court verdict in favour of building a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya would set off a majoritarian Hindu wave in favour of the BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha poll. The alarm bells rang even louder when CJI Misra dismissed all intervention PILs - and there were dozens - in the Ayodhya case. Had those PILs been impleaded, the Ayodhya verdict would have been inevitably delayed. Enraged at the CJI's moves, the Congress has deployed its political ammunition built up over 55 years in power. Sonia and Rahul realise that the 2019 Lok Sabha election is the Congress' best opportunity to make a comeback. That comeback could be stillborn if the Supreme Court rules in favour of building the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The impeachment motion is aimed at unnerving Misra into delaying his verdict till after the 2019 general election. Activists and friendly media have been co-opted to further this objective. The NCP's lawyer-member Majeed Memon said grimly: ""Several Opposition MPs, including me, have signed the petition to remove the chief justice."" Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee was more cautious: ""I can say that Trinamool Congress will go with whatever decision the other parties take on the impeachment of the CJI. After all, one cannot ignore what the four judges had to say."" What the other four Supreme Court judges said at their unprecedented press conference in January 2018 dovetailed nicely into the Congress-led Opposition strategy. They complained about the roster system and the assignment of key cases. But the hidden message was a statement of no-confidence in the CJI. The chief justice was quick to disappoint the quartet. A month later he put up for the first time on the Supreme Court website the new roster. To their shock, the four dissenting senior justices were assigned land and civil cases. CJI Misra, in a clinical show of authority, confined all PILs and sensitive political cases to his own bench. The second sub-text in the impeachment motion is the Opposition's decision to target BJP president Amit Shah. The Congress despises Shah. Rahul Gandhi and Shah do not even acknowledge each other, much less exchange courtesies, in Parliament. The Congress believes that if it can discredit Shah before the 2019 Lok Sabha election, it will slow the BJP's electoral momentum. This is why the Judge Loya incident is being fervidly played up by the Congress. Judge Loya's death in December 2014 in Nagpur forms part of a key PIL being heard by a bench headed by CJI Misra. Judge Loya died following a heart attack. Nearly three years later, in September 2017, Caravan magazine carried a story linking Judge Loya's ""mysterious"" death to a case he was in the midst of hearing. The case involved the death in 2005 in an encounter with police in Gujarat of the notorious smuggler and criminal Sohrabuddin. Amit Shah was then Gujarat's home minister. The allegations: one, that Sohrabuddin was killed in a fake encounter by the Gujarat anti-terror squad on Shah's watch; two, that Judge Loya's death during the trial of the Sohrabuddin case in which Shah was an accused and Loya the presiding judge seemed suspicious and unnatural; and three, that CJI Misra should assign the PIL questioning Judge Loya's death (and Shah's rapid acquittal by a judge who succeeded Judge Loya in the trial court) to another Supreme Court bench. The chief justice did nothing of the kind. Instead he transferred all cases pertaining to Judge Loya's death pending in the Bombay High Court to a Supreme Court bench headed by himself. Dushyant Dave is the senior advocate at the forefront of the allegation that Judge Loya's death was suspicious and unnatural. CJI Misra told a livid Dave that his bench would examine the matter carefully and order an investigation into the case only if it was merited. At every juncture, the Opposition fumes, the chief justice has acted arbitrarily. A close examination of the facts reveals it is the Opposition and its senior lawyers that have acted capriciously. For example, Judge Loya's death was certified as natural by two judges of the Bombay High Court (justices Sunil Shukre and Bhushan Gavai) as well as two district judges who were with Judge Loya in the hours just before and after his death. Caravan magazine in its latest issue has however continued to call Judge Loya's death suspicious, alleging that the post-mortem report was manipulated. The Congress-led Opposition fears that both its pre-2019 electoral objectives - delaying the Ram Mandir verdict and tarnishing Shah over the Loya/Sohrabuddin case - could be negated by chief justice Misra. Hence the unrelenting attack on him through legal and media proxies. CJI Misra retires on October 2, 2018. He could well deliver the Ayodhya and Loya verdicts before that. The process to impeach him is meant to derail both.",2018-04-04,"Amit Shah,Justice Loya,Judicial crisis,Chief justice",Why Congress-led Opposition wants to impeach chief justice of India,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/dipak-misra-chief-justice-judicial-crisis-justice-loya-amit-shah-2019-general-elections/story/1/23262.html
450,Jithin Emmanuel Jacob,"“Whenever I give a hard-hitting lecture on the perils of our caste system,” Prof AF Mathew would tell me, “I have at least a couple of people filled with curiosity to know which caste I belong to.” Prof Mathew is a sociologist par excellence, and a popular professor. He explained: “It’s (his caste) difficult to guage since I don’t have a surname that reveals it, but if there are any Malayalees among those curious folks, especially Christian ones, they would drop by to ask me which church I go to.” Having grown up as a Malayalee Christian, I almost instantly stumbled upon the realisation that I’ve been asked that same question during past conversations, though I had never thought about its implications. In Kerala, as with most of India, Christians of different castes still go to different churches. Perhaps it is the time I have spent with Prof Mathew inside and outside classrooms that has made me a cynic who wouldn’t even bother to roll his eyes if someone told me how caste was no longer relevant among educated, urban Indians. Three years from the conversation with Prof Mathew, I’d move into a new apartment in an upscale neighbourhood in South Bangalore, to be greeted warmly by another Malayalee Christian family who lived next door; a family that has spent nearly its entire lifetime outside of Kerala. It didn’t take long for the question to come up. “So, which church do you go to?” There would be a confirmation about my Latin Catholic identity based on my church, and then, there would be a subtle proclamation of Syrian Catholic pride from the other end. My cynicism around the absence of caste in modern India isn’t just based on my conversation with Prof Mathew. For the past couple of days, many a newsfeed and social media page has been awash with articles surrounding C Raveendranath, the sparkling new poster boy of Kerala’s secular credentials – the state education minister’s  that 1.24 lakh students across government and government aided schools in the state had sought admission without filling the column soliciting their caste have decidedly created ripples. The minister also revealed that the number of such students in class 10 and class 12 combined was just around 500, concluding that it is the younger breed of parents who have chosen to leave columns on caste blank. As heartening as this sounds, the cynic in me cannot help but wonder if this is an indication of a world yet to come, which would be caste-free or caste-blind. Who can denounce caste? The singlemost important point to be considered in the discourse around this trend of parents not declaring their child’s caste is, as ironic as it may sound, the caste of those parents. In a recent interview to a Malayalam news channel, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor spoke of how he had been bought up in an environment entirely devoid of caste and its existence, but it is only many years later that he realised that such a caste agnostic existence was a luxury only the upper caste could afford. It’s fairly safe to say that only those from a privileged, upper caste background can afford to denounce their caste. For most of those who do, the entitlement that their caste has been gifting them through their life is so ingrained in their existence that it is almost impossible for them to alter their world view to consider these as privileges. It isn’t just about my otherwise liberal mother turning casually casteist when she speaks about the super smart son of her friend who scored a single-digit rank in an entrance exam, telling me that the result wasn’t surprising as the family is Brahmin — their “entire body is filled with brains”! It is also about that above average Iyer boy who laments on how he was denied a secure future due to the evil called reservations, an unethical shortcut that students who weren’t as good as him availed of to make way ahead of him. Unfortunately, our entitled Brahmin boy had only memorised the height of the Qutub Minar and the date of Quit India Movement during social sciences classes, and not learnt how his community, one that constituted less than five percent of the Indian population, has historically dominated the higher echelons of government services disproportionately – so much so that Brahmins made up for 55 percent of appointments of civil services in 1912 (when their share of population was 3.2 per cent), and continued to enjoy a share of 37 per cent even as late as 1990 (population share: 3.5 per cent). An even more interesting contrast is the employment pattern of Scheduled Castes (SCs) in the country. As per the Annual Report 2005-06 of the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions, 60 percent of all sweepers in central government offices belonged to various SC communities. Affirmative action and reservation policies of our government only seek to disrupt this status quo, and over the years, it is only natural that the dominance of our so-called higher castes slim down and representations from the marginalised castes grow consistently. Now, we have children born into Brahmin families where aspiring to be an IAS officer would be commonplace, and children born into SC families where even securing a class D clerical job availing reservations would tantamount to an achievement. Are there any doubts as to which of these children would be comfortable openly denouncing their castes? What is in a name? Writer and thinker civic Chandran Chinnangath posted a question on Facebook upon hearing this news of caste denouncement in Kerala: “Do we know how many Nair’s, Varma’s, Panicker’s, Warrier’s and Namboothiri’s sought admission to these schools this year” These are surnames eponymous with various forward caste groups in Kerala, equivalent to Sharmas, Bansals, Jhas and Sinhas from other parts of the country. A typical case of entitlement entwined with existence is when usage of such caste-based surnames is passed off as merely a name with a nice ring. So, we have a wonderfully articulate and progressive individual like actor Prithviraj Sukumaran who decides to keep his caste in his daughter’s name, yet speaks with full conviction that he is against the caste system, justifying his choice as merely a name, and not a caste reference. As with the anecdote with which I began this piece, caste hasn’t let go of Christian families who had chosen not to use caste names for decades, if not centuries. Thus, it’s quite naïve to believe that a Menon or a Nair would be perceived and accepted as mere names by the society we live in. A Punjabi friend of mine had told me a few years back that the rationale to eradicate caste differences was behind the usage of the generic surnames “Singh” for all men and ‘”Kaur” for all women. But when I sat inside a multiplex watching the biopic of our beloved Captain Cool, I could only smile to myself, seeing Sushant Singh Rajput play Mahendra Singh Dhoni on screen. What is there to celebrate? In my favourite scene from the movie Newton (India’s official entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars this year), an old man asks Nutan Kumar, an upright government officer, a rather innocuous question. “Do you know what your problem is?” “My honesty?” Nutan asks. “No.” He clarifies. “Your arrogance about your honesty.” It is a conversation that drives home a range of messages. Why is there a need to carry arrogance over the fact that you are sincere at your job? Why the need to be proud of the fact that you are giving up a privilege that you’ve been unfairly living through for as long as you know? The moment a person from an upper caste expects even a bit of applause for choosing not to use her caste for their next generation, she defeats the purpose of her action, as it comes across as a sacrifice that she seems to be making for the greater good. It isn’t by any means a sacrifice, but merely an act of disparaging long-standing injustice. Yet, it would be unfair to blame people who have chosen not to use caste for admissions as the school entry form is a personal document, and not a space for public proclamation, hence it would be their own choice to do so. But, what many individuals do not understand is that caste is not a personal choice – it is a societal practice that clings to you even if you choose to ignore it. That said, I’m certainly not proud of the state government using this data as a reason to celebrate. It is also important to explore whether such an act of promoting a caste agnostic society would cast pressure on lower castes, inculcating a feeling of guilt in them for wanting to declare their caste identities to avail the legal benefits that the government has bestowed upon them for their upliftment. As is clear from every empirical study and pattern, the ones who would benefit most from a caste agnostic society are those with lineages soaked in the scent of privilege, which, in our social context, would mostly constitute our upper castes. However, beyond everything above, I too felt a shimmer of hope seeing the number of parents who have chosen to keep their children casteless. I’ll conclude sharing a rather astonishing insight I gathered during my research on this article. For almost every Google search that I ran around castes and professions, most results were links leading to matrimonial websites, where castes still reign supreme, unchallenged and undisputed. My glimmer of hope lies in there. A couple of decades from now, even if half of these casteless children from Kerala schools decide to carry that belief when — as grown-ups — they choose their spouses, we would indeed be welcoming a beautiful new era in our country.

451,Romita Datta,"On March 28, when Trinamool Congress chief   came calling at 10, Janpath, she caught UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi by surprise with her offer. The Bengal CM asked the Congress to join the ""people’s front of India"" - comprising all like-minded ""secular"", regional parties - to take on the BJP. Naturally, this was an invitation the UPA chairperson wasn’t prepared for. Confused, she said she would convey the message to AICC chief Rahul Gandhi. Such a proposal leaves very little space and scope for the Congress to call the shots in states where regional parties are either in the number one position, or are the principal challenger to the BJP and the NDA. Given the situation, where political space is shrinking for the Congress, one state after another, the party will have no reason to claim a level-playing field, not ot mention the question of having a field day in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress fears that such terms and conditions will not only marginalise the party, but will strip it of its status and importance to just a fringe element, which can be tagged on or dropped off as an appendage. Obviously, it was hard to digest. And Sonia didn't even risk such a proposition. The offer came and it was politely returned with a typically evasive will-think-it-later. Letting the Congress cobble up a front is a strict no-no among some parties, such as Trinamool Congress, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, Telugu Desam Party and Shiv Sena, which believe that they would be in a position to dictate by winning a sizeable number of MPs on their own. However, quite a large number of political parties are soft on the Congress, prominent among them being the RJD, the SP and the NCP and the National Conference. They are trying to reason out with Banerjee that a front minus the Congress is not viable. The Congress and its UPA partners being in the political arena as a separate entity will only lead to a further split in the anti-incumbency and anti-BJP votes. So, the Congress has to stay in the Opposition platform to take the one-on-one fight, which Banerjee is canvassing, to a macro perspective. Benerjee was in Delhi, picking up friends for her front. She kept her doors ajar. Anyone nursing a grudge against the BJP was welcome, even those who were in the party and feeling restive. From Kanimozhi to Misa Bharti, throughout her stay in the Capital in Parliament lobby, visitors kept Banerjee busy. In return, she embraced them, touched NCP leader Sharad Pawar’s feet, but gave Sonia Gandhi a miss on the first day of her outing and scouting in Parliament. Though she and her party also clarified that it was unintentional, what came out of the meeting wasn’t encouraging enough to suggest otherwise. By the time Banerjee had sent her emissary to Sonia, seeking an appointment, she was gone. After reaching New Delhi, Banerjee was not only meeting like-minded friends, she, in fact, made it quite clear who all figure in her friend list. In her meeting with the three disgruntled BJP leaders - Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie and Shatrughan Sinha - Banerjee was actually complaining as to how Rahul Gandhi bungled all the chances in Tripura by not understanding the urgency to form a grand alliance of all the parties in the Opposition along with the tribal parties. The conditions Banerjee, as the chief architect of the front in-the-making, had held out for the Congress is ignominious. Obviously, neither mother nor son will agree, laying down their arms and allowing someone else to brandish the weapons. The front has looked fractured from the beginning. There are differences of opinions as to who should be in and who should be out. Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav’s aunt-nephew equation doesn’t look that good: the aunt having already made it public that there’s going to be some hard bargain over seat-sharing in the 2019 elections. Fissures are already growing and the one common foe, around whom the friends have forged ties, is having a good laugh. For all the big talk about anti-Modi and anti-BJP front, the line between friends and foes appears thin and blurred so far.

452,Claude Arpi,"Are we witnessing a ""Trumpisation"" of the Indian foreign policy? Some signs tend to show that, like the Trump presidency, the Narendra Modi government is prone to changing its stance, principally in its relations with China, though ""destabilisation"" of the opponent might not be the Indian motivation, as is often the case with the American move. Take the programme ""Thank you India"", planned by the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) in Dharamsala. On February 22, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale wrote to cabinet secretary PK Sinha, advising Indian government officials, including ministers, to skip the events organised by Dharamsala. Sinha obliged and ministries were informed to stay away from a function to celebrate the 59th anniversary of the arrival of the Dalai Lama in India. The Indian and foreign press abundantly commented on Sinha’s ""leaked"" missive. The MEA apparently said that it was not supposed to have been ""leaked"", but India is an open society and such things are bound to happen. Now, despite the missive, two government representatives attended the function which had in the meantime been shifted to Dharamsala. Journalist Indrani Bagchi wrote: “After a stunning volte-face on its China policy that made it seem like India was suddenly kowtowing to China, India is trying to recalibrate its approach.” Union minister for culture Mahesh Sharma and BJP general secretary Ram Madhav participated in the Dalai Lama’s ""Thank you India"" programme. Gokhale had personally met the Dalai Lama and Lobsang Sangay, the Tibetan ""president"", to ask them to move the celebrations outside Delhi. In order not to rock the boat with China, the government had earlier refused permission to the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), funded by the ministry of defence, to have a conference on India-China relations in its premises in Delhi. A global parliamentarians’ conference on Tibet scheduled for April, was also not permitted. Apart from the latest summersault, which does not give a mature image to the Indian diplomacy, a question remains: why did Gokhale and Sinha need to put their warning in writing? China was certainly delighted by the circular, even though it has not incited Beijing to be ""nicer"" to India or accept compromises on any of the contentious issues between the two nations. For the last 60 years and more, each time India has kowtowed, China has given nothing in exchange. The best example has been the Panchsheel agreement. During the four-month negotiations in 1954, India surrendered one by one all its rights in Tibet, and hardly one month after the signature of the accord, the People’s Liberation Army started intruding in Barahoti, in today’s Uttarakhand, while a road was being built on Indian territory, in the Aksai Chin area. Has any lesson been learnt? An article in   commented: “That the letter was leaked a day before the foreign secretary was visiting Beijing suggests that a message was also being sent to China — that India would not allow the Dalai Lama to agitate the Tibet issue in India publicly.” There is no doubt that the high-profile Tibetan event in Delhi would have irritated China, but why could the government not have discreetly informed the Office of the Dalai Lama and the CTA, that important visits were due in the coming months (defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and the Prime Minster will soon pay visits to China) and that Delhi did not want any provocation which could trigger a new  when the snows melt. South Block has a Liaison Office, with a senior officer posted in Dharamsala to communicate with the Dalai Lama and the CTA. The logical approach was to send a message to the Tibetans explaining the situation. Some have suggested that the objective was to slight the CTA. This is possible and though not verified, it was rumoured that the CTA had gone ahead without coordinating with the ministry; if true, it would be a slip. It has also been said that the November 2017 clandestine visit to China of former Tibetan Prime Minister Samdhong Rinpoche had irritated South Block. The Chinese government would like the Dalai Lama to accept that Tibet has always been a part of China. That would create serious problems for India as it would mean that the McMahon Line, agreed to by independent Tibet and British India on the side of the Simla Conference in 1914, would have no legal worth. It is, however, doubtful if the Dalai Lama will ever concede something which is blatantly untrue. It is also true that the CTA has not always been sensitive to India’s problems. When during the Doklam standoff, Lobsang Sangay unfurled the Tibetan flag on the shores of the Pangong Lake, bordering Tibet in Ladakh, it was not very helpful to cool the tempers at the trijunction. In the meantime, deep reforms are taking place in China. For example, the United Front Work Department, which deals amongst other things with Tibet, has been given an increased importance, taking over the State Council Overseas Office, the National Ethnic Affairs Commission and the State Administration for Religious Affairs. Observers expect that it will translate into a tighter control over religion and ethnic issues, in particular in Tibet and Xinjiang. This has implications for India. These are serious issues which should be taken as priority by South Block while India’s Tibet policy should discreetly be fine-tuned in coordination with Dharamsala; one party should not embarrass the other. As for the ""Thank you India"" programme, one way for the Tibetans to ""thank"" India would be to reassert the India-Tibet borders in places such as Demchok, Chumar or Barahoti. In the meantime, ""Trumpisation"" will not help anybody… except for China.

453,Abhishek Anicca,"""  is Bihar's renaissance man."" A decade ago, that reflected the optimism of Bihar. Bihar, which was moving out of years of backwardness back then. Today, it sounds more like a cruel joke that Kumar has played on Bihar in his quest to satiate his hunger for power and his ever-growing ego. One should have ideally predicted what is unravelling in Bihar now. Everyone can see a   but the leader himself. But this weakness is new. Kumar has never been so weak. The story of his downfall started when he broke his first alliance with BJP before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Then whatever was left of his credibility completely took a nosedive in 2017 when again, on a whim, he broke the alliance with RJD and went with the BJP. It was not only a betrayal of the mandate given by the people of Bihar but also a betrayal of his own conscience, which he often cites for his flimsy political decisions. His political downfall has been also marked by a consistent downfall in his popularity. Many caste groups that voted for ""sushasan"" (good governance) have found alternatives and have shifted loyalties. One could say that many are getting increasingly disillusioned by the lack of development after his first term as Bihar chief minister. At the same time, a resurgent Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is gaining support on the ground. Janata Dal United's alliance partner, BJP, is aggressively eating into the party's votes. Members of Nitish Kumar's own party are abdicating what they consider to be a sinking ship. The alarm bells have been ringing for some time now.  is a direct result of Kumar's failure as a leader and a politician. Bihar has always been communally sensitive around festivals. Whenever Hindu and Muslim festivals have clashed, tension has been palpable on the roads, some manufactured, others spontaneous. But it was mostly a local and temporary problem with things normalising within a few days. But what started around Ram Navami this year seems to be something different. There was no clash of festivals. In fact, as more news surfaces about how the events unfolded, the tention seems to be something that was orchestrated and planned and most fingers point to some devious right wing groups. These groups have certainly been empowered by the communal pitch made by many leaders of Bihar BJP and there are signs that some cadre leaders might have been involved in what transpired on the ground. Again, a leader with the experience of Kumar should have seen this coming long back. He should have seen this the day he forged an alliance with the BJP. He should have been well aware of BJP's ambition in Bihar and must have had a clue on how they would want to achieve it. Maybe in his lust for power, he refused to see what was so evident. In this era of instant messaging, it takes little time for rumours to turn into riots. Right wing groups have been using social media to spread communal distrust for some time now. In the last two years, many such incidents have taken place in Bihar. In 2016, there was communal tension in Saran after a video of an idol being desecrated was circulated on social media. Similar events took place in 2017. Right now, parts of Aurangabad, Nawada, Kishanganj as well as many other parts of Bihar are tense. Small incidents have flared up turned into riots, fanned by vested interests. It would be foolish not to see a concerted effort to create communal divide in Bihar. Yet, the government has done nothing to prevent the situation. Thus these riots have not only brought Kumar's administrative capabilities under the spotlight but have also put his political future in jeopardy. His party is a one-man party centred around him. Anyone who has disagreed with him has been shown the door. There is no agenda, not even some ideological base to drive his political future, except maybe his personal caste base. But in a highly polarised Bihar, even Kurmis, Mahadalits and a section of the OBCs, who have been loyal to him, might vote differently. But I am sure that Kumar already knows that. There are murmurs in the corridors of power these days that he is unhappy with his current allies. Whether there is another break-up on the cards or not, his political future surely looks bleak. For now, the least he can do for Bihar and Biharis is to contain the poison of communal hatred from further spreading. He can display the administrative capabilities he was once known for and use the state machinery to stop these riots and identify the culprits who orchestrated them. As Kumar plays his social reformer avatar, perhaps it's a good time for him to pitch for communal harmony. But Nitish Kumar knows, as does the rest of Bihar, that such an agenda might not please his alliance partner. Nitish Kumar has created a political and administrative mess for which he will have to pay, sooner than later. Meanwhile, it is the people of Bihar who continue to pay the price of his political decisions.",2018-04-01,"Nitish Kumar,Riots,Communal Violence,Nitish Kumar",Why Nitish Kumar will pay heavily for Bihar riots,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bihar-communal-violence-communal-violence-riots-nitish-kumar-jdu-bjp-alliance/story/1/23200.html
454,Sharat Pradhan,"Lack of experience, complacency and failure of the top brass to plug the loopholes in the administration led to the CBSE question paper leak. Mindless changes in the overall conduct of an examination which is taken by more than 20 lakh students every year, have brought a bad name to the country’s most prestigious examination board. Top CBSE officials failed to keep in safe custody the question papers that were stored in the highly vulnerable cooperative banks well known for their very fragile security setups, and therefore prone to all kinds of irregularities. In some places, even local post offices were used for safekeeping. Significantly, in the past, question papers were necessarily kept in the strongrooms of scheduled nationalised banks. It was only recently that CBSE chose to entrust cooperative banks with this massive responsibility. Indiscriminate selection of examination centres was also responsible for the loose grip over the question papers' security. With the increasing demand for the CBSE education pattern, which is fast becoming the preferred choice of schools and students in different parts of the country, educational institutions were coming up in many remote areas where scheduled banks do not have branches and, therefore, question papers had to be stored in post offices. CBSE’s decision to do away with the old practice of preparing multiple sets of question papers has also proved detrimental for the entire system. Under that arrangement, different sets of question papers were made for different regions in the country. Hence, it was widely felt that if the earlier system had been allowed to continue, the leak would have remained limited to a particular region. That would also have made it easier for the board to hold the re-examination in the region where the malpractice was first reported from. Three years ago, the Union human resource development ministry had decided to do away with yet another tradition - of selecting educationists as CBSE chiefs. Instead, IAS officers began to be handpicked for the job. The incumbent chief is the third such officer in succession and happens to be a bureaucrat from the blue-eyed Gujarat cadre. Incidentally, the board secretary, from the Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS), is a rank outsider. It is alleged that under the current dispensation, selections to key positions, particularly in the field of education, are made on extraneous considerations like political connections or ideological leanings. Experts who have been in the know of CBSE's traditions feel that some common sense could have saved the situation from taking such a disastrous turn that has led to even the integrity of the board being questioned besides giving sleepless nights to 20 lakh students who are now compelled to take the examination again. Former CBSE chairman Ashok Ganguly told this scribe in Lucknow: “It is time that the CBSE top brass does a rethink and reverts to some of the old systems, otherwise the safety and security of question papers could turn into a perennial problem.” He felt that “we should not ignore the fact that both classes 10 and 12 are extremely crucial stages in the academic career of every student’s life; therefore, such issues should not be taken lightly”. Ganguly, who headed the board from 2000 to 2008 - a record tenure – is strongly of the view that the multiple question paper sets system was more foolproof and pragmatic.

455,Kamal Mitra Chenoy,"Now that discussions on elections and political alliances are growing intense, a substantial section of the middle strata is debating the utility of caste, arguing that its prevalence is a hindrance to secular, non-casteist politics. But the problem is that castes, or in the case of most of the northeast tribals, loyalties play a role. But this is a misinterpretation as backward tribes come under the Scheduled Tribes (ST) category, and they too are part of the Backward Classes (BCs), including STs, Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Other Backward Castes (OBCs). Interestingly, many members of the Constituent Assembly questioned the relevance of the category “Backward Classes (BCs)”, arguing that classes could not be castes. BR Ambedkar, the architect of our Constitution, among others, explained the term “BCs” as framed by the British and incorporated SCs+STs+OBCs. The term Schedule was again a British innovation through which castes were put into separate schedules on the basis of social and educational backwardness. Using these categories and others, the Maharaja of Mysore, in the early 20th century, also classified castes. Yet, this issue was raised by the architect of the Constitution Dr BR Ambedkar himself in his last speech in the Constituent Assembly (CA). Ambedkar noted that as far as political rights were concerned, there was equality because there was “one man, one vote, one value”. But he warned that in social and economic life there was no such equality. He asked, “How long will we continue with these contradictions?” Ambedkar went on to say that those who were not socially and economically empowered might turn against the Constitution which had been so laboriously built and go on to destroy what was built. Unfortunately, this closely reasoned argument by Ambedkar was given short shrift. After that he drifted away from the Congress. But the caste system in its social and educational aspects was incorporated with a formulation that the BCs would be identified by “social and educational backwardness”. In the 1990s, the Mandal Commission was brought into the socio-political discourse by VP Singh. A tirade, widespread violence and a strident anti-Backward Classes sentiment were given an impetus by the media and political parties. Finally, the matter came to the Supreme Court. The redoubtable lawyer Fali Nariman argued that OBCs could not get reservation rights in education and jobs as they were a “creamy layer”. Only the poor OBCs could get reservation, but relatively most of the middle class of backwards and OBCs would not be eligible. The Supreme Court bench, which was overwhelmingly upper caste, supported Nariman’s argument with the sole dissenting voice being Justice Pandian, who was himself from the BCs. There was another questionable aspect in the majority decision. The Constitution clearly lays out that Backward Class status is based on “social and educational backwardness”. There is no mention of the “economically” backward. Why? Because caste positions and strata are not based on economic criteria but social and educational criteria, in which OBCs are massively behind the upwardly social and educationally upwardly mobile middle strata. Yet large sections of the middle strata and rich — that latter including a sizeable number of media and legal experts — keep crying foul at the influence of caste especially when it comes to elections. Why does caste come into elections, leading to casteist opportunist politics, many say. The answer is that many Indians have caste backgrounds, including those who identify themselves as Muslims, Christians and Sikhs. Marriages and other occasions often have a link to old caste rituals. In matrimonial alliances, caste linkages invariably play a major role. So why this paranoia about caste? If the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, why this hypocrisy? Prime Minister Narendra Modi flaunted his Extremely Backward Class (EBC) status before the 2014 general elections. Did this go against him? No, it didn’t! If monetary ties are fine, why are caste ties found abhorrent? Class ties are common, as are common religious ties. Do caste/religious ties constrain secular voting in elections? The electorate is increasingly aligned more towards what the candidates are promising them, rather than alignments based on caste ties alone. Of course, caste ties do play a role, especially if they cement an alliance either in only one caste or an acceptable caste combination. But aren’t there middle strata or rich caste combinations? In sum, castes are here to stay. Just like distinctions of class, religion and gender. There is not much choice. But in itself isn’t this a very diverse pool of choice? Aren’t inter-caste, inter-religious marriages on the rise? So, the current phobia about casteism is misguided and blown out of proportion. The 2019 general elections will probably legitimise the view that caste is not the sole arbiter.",2018-03-31,"BSP-SP combine,Modi government,Ambedkar,2019 general elections",Why caste alone will not win 2019 general elections,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/2019-general-elections-modi-ambedkar-obc-sc-st-status-caste-bsp-sp/story/1/23190.html
456,Harsh V Pant,"As was expected, Vladimir Putin won Russia’s Presidential elections comfortably and will be leading Russia for another six years. He got more than 76 per cent of the vote and became the longest serving Russian leader since Stalin, being at the helm of Russia as either president or prime minister since 1999. He wanted to ensure that the scale of victory was higher than the last time when he had won around 64 per cent and he succeeded in drumming up that support. While Putin has celebrated his victory as recognition of “the achievements of the last few years,” the elections were stage managed to a large extent with the main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, being barred from the race. With the coronation of Xi Jinping as China’s “ ” for life and Putin’s election in Russia, a new form of authoritarian political order is shaping up, challenging the liberal order like never before. India, of course, has a long standing relationship with Russia but that is undergoing a shift in the light of rapidly evolving geopolitical realities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was prompt in tweeting his wishes for Putin’s new term in office. For India, what should be concerning is Russia’s increasing tilt towards Pakistan as it seeks to curry favour with China. Moscow had historically supported New Delhi at the United Nations Security Council by repeatedly vetoing resolutions on the Kashmir issue. Today, however, there is a change in how Moscow views its regional priorities in South Asia. In a significant development, the joint declaration issued at the end of the first ever six-nation Speaker’s Conference in Islamabad held in December end supported Pakistani line on Kashmir. This declaration signed by Afghanistan, China, Iran, Pakistan, Russia and Turkey underscored that “for ensuring global and regional peace and stability, the issue of Jammu and Kashmir needs peaceful resolution by Pakistan and India in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.” During his visit to New Delhi in December, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov publicly called on India to join China’s  and hoped that New Delhi will find a way out to benefit from the mega connectivity project without sacrificing its position on the issues flagged by it. Lavrov also made his displeasure clear over New Delhi’s warming up to the idea of a quadrilateral engagement involving the US, India, Japan and Australia in the Indo-Pacific. He suggested “that sustainable security architecture in the Asia Pacific region cannot be achieved through bloc arrangement and is only possible through an open ended collective basis.” Despite the best efforts of the top leaderships in India and Russia, divergences are growing in this bilateral relationship as the underlying structural changes in the international environment are pulling the two nations apart. For Russia, the US-led West presents its biggest challenge and its foreign policy priorities increasingly revolve around pushing back against the West at every level. The West views Russia as one of the most disruptive forces in global politics, even more so than China in many ways. The initial optimism of a US-Russia rapprochement post Donald Trump has died down now with domestic politics in the US becoming ever so contentious. For India, the prism is different as it has to manage the negative externalities emerging from the rise of China in its vicinity. Chinese power is now intruding into India’s traditional sphere of influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region. The growing power disparity between India and China is making the border situation more unstable. China-Pakistan nexus is proving difficult to contain as India gets ready to face a two-front challenge. China refuses to recognise Indian global power aspirations and has not yielded on key Indian security demands. As a result, while Russia may find cooperation with China as a perfectly legitimate response to its problems with the West, India does not have that luxury. New Delhi has to therefore find like-minded countries to build alternative platforms and narratives so as to preclude Chinese hegemony in the wider Indo-Pacific. Russia’s growing collusion with China and Pakistan will continue to test the Indo-Russian partnership in the coming years. For a relationship that largely relies on defence and where the economic underpinnings are lagging, the need of the hour should be to have candid conversations about the current state of play in the relationship. Just relying on sentimentalism of the past won’t work anymore as new challenges confront India and Russia and the lobal geostrategic environment undergoes a profound reordering.

457,Aroon Purie,"When bestselling writer Yuval Noah Harari talked at the India Today Conclave in Mumbai of the possibility of the North Korean government forcing its citizens to wear a bracelet transmitting biometric data to government data centres to monitor how people feel about their leader, it seemed straight out of science fiction. In a Digital Dictatorship, he warned, technology would be able to extract high-precision biometric data from people and report back to a centralised decision-making control system, owned by governments or by corporations­ - or both. It turns out we’re not so far off from that reality, given recent revelations by a whistleblower of the role of British firm Cambridge Analytica (CA) in using a data-harvesting app that was allowed by Facebook to gather data of 50 million users without their consent. Set up in 2014 with Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist of United States President Donald Trump, as vice-president, CA used the data to aid Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign as well as to manipulate audience behaviour in the 2016 Brexit referendum and the 2017 Kenyan elections. According to the whistleblower, former CA employee Christopher Wylie, the Facebook data helped develop psychological profiles of users, which was subsequently used to influence them. This, reportedly, had a greater impact on voters than traditional advertising. The story has an Indian dimension too, with Wylie claiming that the Congress might have been CA’s client in the past. The Congress has strongly denied the allegation and that explains the current slanging match between them and the BJP on this issue. Be that as it may, the larger question is of the emergence of transnational digital corporations such as Facebook, Google and Amazon whose access to information has given them great power with practically no accountability. They know everything about us - where we are, who we talk to, what we buy, access to our e-mails and our contacts, our photographs, our interests, our predilections and more. Enough to build a complete psychological profile of us. Now the big question is how all this data is used and by whom. I may have given my consent in order to use the services offered by these companies, but as it is now being discovered, this has huge societal implications. This data is the new gold in the hands of private corporations whose prime motive is profit. They are like the monopoly oil companies of yore which had to be broken up to avoid concentration of economic power. It is possibly worse, as it can be used, as we have seen in America and other countries, to subvert democracy. Messages can be sent that play to our prejudices. Add to that fake bots and Twitter accounts that can influence the way we think. Another byproduct of this algorithm-driven data mining is that we will continue to be served the kind of content we had liked in the past. This means the converted speak to the converted with the result that diversity of opinion and debate get restricted. This is not a problem confined to developed countries. With over 250 million active users, India has the largest user base for Facebook. WhatsApp and Instagram, two other entities owned by Facebook, have over 200 million and 53 million users in India, respectively. India has a low social media penetration of 19 per cent at the moment but with a 31 per cent annual growth rate, it is the second fastest-growing country in this aspect. Predicting voter behaviour through Facebook trends may be vastly overrated, but politics is increasingly about selling a product. No wonder the number of followers or likes one has is a matter of significance. This explains why heads of state like Trump and Narendra Modi use social media platforms like Twitter to announce executive orders, conduct diplomacy and communicate directly with voters. This controversy comes close on the heels of embarrassing leaks in India's biometric ID programme Aadhaar, which, with over 1.1 billion users, is the world's biggest database. The cover story, written by senior associate editor Kaushik Deka, with columns by experts across several fields, examines all aspects and underlines the necessity of regulating potential misuse of data as well as defining the privacy law clearly - the Supreme Court has already said Indians enjoy a fundamental right to privacy, that it is intrinsic to life and liberty and thus comes under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. India is the fifth most vulnerable country in the world in terms of cyber security breaches, according to the Internal Security Threat Report of 2017 by Symantec. Clearly, unless you wish to lead a life of an ascetic, it is impossible to escape the digital world. It has changed our lives for the better, but at a huge cost. These new digital gatekeepers have the potential of poisoning our politics and tainting our society. There is also the danger of the government getting its grubby hands on data of private citizens. Democracy is not just about elections, but also about protection of people’s liberties and freedoms. There is an urgent need for regulation which is transparent about the sharing and use of data. So next time you are on a social media platform or on a search engine, remember many Big Brothers are tracking you.

458,Devdan Chaudhuri,"A   is going on in Bengal that aims to re-engineer the cultural fabric of the state. For the past couple of years,   has become the annual occasion and the nodal point to assert the socio-cultural engineering mission of the RSS-BJP. They want to ""convert"" the Bengali Hindus in the image of Hindi-speaking Hindutva-Hindus, ""colonise"" Bengal with the help of the fast-mushrooming RSS shakas (more than 1,350 in 2017) and ""conquer"" the ""never-conquered-by-the-right-wing"" state by winning elections on the communal plank: ""Islamist threat"" and the ""Hindu identity"". The RSS-BJP has certain misunderstandings about Bengal’s culture and history. They don’t understand that a Bengali is a Bengali first, before he or she is a Hindu. In fact, a Bengali can be a Hindu, a Muslim, a Brahmo, a Vaishnav, a Buddhist, a Christian and an atheist, and yet share the common ""Bengali language and culture"". The RSS-BJP doesn’t seem to understand that all Bengalis are not Hindus, and all Muslims in Bengal are not ""jihadists from Bangladesh"". Last year, when the Ram Navami processions - organised by the saffron brigade - made news due to the aggressive display of swords and tridents, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee voiced the common feeling among the Bengalis. Speaking about the saffron brigade, Didi had said, ""They don’t know Bengali culture… All they know is to roam around with swords."" There was no violence last year, but things have become progressively worse. This year, violence erupted during the Ram Navami rallies, a couple of people died, the saffron outfits clashed with the police in several places around Bengal, chiefly in Murshidabad and Bardhaman districts. ""Violence for votes"" in the name of Ram seems to be the strategy of the saffron brigade in Bengal. This has thrown up an enormous challenge to maintain peace and harmony - without which the state will struggle to develop and to progress - and to protect the traditional liberal cultural ethos of Bengal from being mutilated by Hindutva, a recent import into Bengal from the Hindi-speaking regions of India. Ram is not worshipped in Bengal, like he is worshipped in north and western India. Bengal has devised her own way to celebrate Ram Nabomi via Annapurna Puja - a form of Shakti. This cultural tradition is followed by millions of Bengalis. In Bengal, we have this popular saying ""baro mashe, tero parbon"". It means, that in Bengal we have, ""in 12 months, 13 festivals"". The culture of festivities and melas is also strongly related to the socio-economic system. The annual flow of various festivals - panning all religions and sub-cultures - is going on for a long time. This lies at the heart of the secular and plural fabric of Bengal’s culture. Bengal has been worshipping Shakti - the feminine force of existence - for centuries. The Bengali language and the culture was first developed under the Buddhist Pala Empire (750–1174 CE) that had ruled Vanga for 424 years, much before the arrival of the Mughals and the British. Sanskrit was spoken in Bengal since the first millennium BCE. During the Gupta Empire, Bengal was a hub of Sanskrit language. The Bengali language evolved between 1000-1200 CE from Sanskrit and Magadhi Prakrit. Proto-Bengali was the language of the Buddhist Pala Empire. Buddhist Tara was worshipped. There was an original shrine of Tara in Tarapeeth, before the popular Ma Kali temple was constructed. Darjeeling was Dorje-Ling meaning ""land of the thunderbolt"". It had an ancient Mahayana Buddhist monastery on the Observatory Hill, where now a Buddhist Mahakala Temple -  with fluttering prayer flags - looks towards the ""Five Treasures of Snow"", or the Kangchenjunga. The esoteric Tantra philosophy of Buddhist Vajrayana was developed in Vanga. The influential Buddhist philosopher and saint who went to Tibet was Asita (982-1054 CE). He was a Bengali with the name of Dipankar. Tilopa (988–1069 CE) - an exponent of Annutara Yoga Tantra - wrote the 28 verses of ""The Ganges Mahamudra"". He was also a Bengali. Tilopa’s disciple was Naropa, who wrote extensively and was an abbot of ancient Nalanda University. He too was a Bengali. The Nalanda University that was in Bihar, from Buddhist Vihara, profoundly influenced the ancient intellectuals and philosophers of Vanga. The tradition of Shakti worship has continued in Vanga/Bengal for centuries since the time of the Pala Empire. After the decline of Buddhism, goddesses from both Buddhist and Sakta traditions were combined to form the 10 goddesses of the Mahavidya, better known as Dasha Mahavidyas (Ten Great Wisdoms). Now, Ma Kali and Ma Durga are the most popular goddesses in Bengal while Lakshmi and Saraswati are also worshipped. Bengal, a place for Shakti or the feminine principle of the universe, has also contributed to a couple of key social reforms that benefitted the women of India. Rammohan Roy started the campaign against sati that eventually abolished the practice by law in 1829. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar campaigned for the right of widows to remarry that led to the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856. This happened during the Bengal renaissance that challenged the existing orthodoxies and brought about an era of radical ideas, revival of spirit and evolution of consciousness. The Bengal renaissance inspired monumental strides in literature, science, social reforms, religion, art and spirituality. Bengal has also a unique tradition of worshipping an indigenous pantheon of ""non-Brahmanic"" folk gods and goddesses - Dharma-Thakur, Shasti, Manasha, Chandi, Shitala, Basanti and Bon-bibi. The higher classes of Bengalis in towns and cities don’t worship these folk deities. They are largely the deities of rural Bengal and the poor. The overwhelming majority of these folk deities are feminine. This also follows the Shakti worshipping instinct of Bengal. Now, after knowing the history and culture of Bengal, one feels really disturbed, when during the RSS-BJP-organised Ram Navami rally last year - the patriarchal Hindi-Hindustani-Hindutva brigade - on the soil of Bengal, had the audacity to utter slogans like: ""Na Durga, na Kali, keval Ram aur Bajrangbali."" An attempt is being made to engineer Bengal away from her ancient traditions and make her embrace patriarchal male gods in the image of Hindi-speaking Hindutva heartland.  The culture of Bengal is being sought to be changed to mirror the Hindi cow belt. Many right wing cultural ""lessons"" are being sought to be imparted. However, Bengal doesn’t need lessons on nationalism and Hinduism from the saffron brigade. From Vivekananda to Aurobindo, and from Subhas Chandra Bose to Maulana Azad, there have been countless personalities from Bengal who have devoted their lives to the service of nationalism and Hinduism. I feel it is a futile attempt to convert, colonise and conquer Bengal in the name of Hinduism and nationalism. This won’t work, the backlash will be swift. The vote share of BJP is likely to fall, not increase. Having said the above, I also know that Bengal has entered a trail of fire - almost like Sita’s Agnipariksha - when the traditional ethos of Bengal is being tested by the well-organised and well-funded campaign by the Hindutva forces. If Bengal has to remain as Bengal, she has to smother the cultural and the political growth of the RSS-BJP in the state. She cannot afford to bring upon itself an era of regressive ideals, communal polarisation and societal unrest. But there is no doubt that a challenge has been thrown by the RSS-BJP. Mahabharata is breaking out in Bengal in lieu of Ramayana. As 2019 General Election and 2021 Assembly elections approach, the battle will intensify. The spectre of violence and turmoil looms in the horizon. There is no scope for complacency anymore. Everyone in Bengal has to wake up to the circumstances and do what he or she can to avert the ""cultural transformation"" that is being engineered by the saffron brigade. The saffron conquest of Bengal is required for the dream of Hindu/Hindutva Rashtra. As long as Bengal holds out against Hindutva - along with a couple of southern states - the Indian Constitution will remain safe. The future of India, like it has been many times before in our long history, might depend upon the future of Bengal. The stakes couldn’t be higher, than this.",2018-03-28,"Hindutva,RSS-BJP,West Bengal,Ram Navami violence",Ram Navami violence: Why Hindutva forces are fanning communal flames in West Bengal,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/ram-navami-violence-west-bengal-rss-bjp-hindutva-mamata-banerjee/story/1/23147.html
459,Kanwal Sibal,"German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier's just-concluded visit to India was important on many counts. Unlike his predecessor Joachim Gauck who visited India in 2014, Steinmeier has much greater international recognition and more political weight, having been foreign minister for eight years in two spells (2005-09 and 2013-17) and vice-chancellor from 2007 to 2009. His visit has come after Germany has been able to form a coalition government after a lapse of some months, an exercise in which he has played a significant exhortatory role. The value of his visit lies in the consolidation of our understandings both in the bilateral and international contexts. Germany is India’s biggest economic partner in Europe and the sixth largest at the global level, with bilateral trade in 2016-17 amounting to $18.3 billion (Rs 1,18,501 crore), which is below the peak of $23 billion (Rs 1,48,844 crore) reached in 2011-12. Nearly 1,800 German companies have invested $10.71 billion (Rs 69,309 crore) in India from April 2000 to December 2017, making it the seventh largest investor in India, but as this amounts to only 3 per cent of the total FDI received by India from 2000 to March 2017, there is scope for considerable expansion. (In comparison, India has invested more than $6 billion — Rs 38,826 crore — in Germany till December 2016). Given that the German economy is the largest in Europe (constituting 28 per cent of the euro area economy) and the fourth largest globally, not to mention Germany ranking as the third largest exporting country in the world, our bilateral economic relations could be more voluminous. By comparison, Germany’s trade with China, its largest trade partner, stood at euro 169.9 billion (Rs 13,69,460 crore) in 2016. We have been long pushing for greater German investment in India, especially from middle-sized German companies that are the backbone of the German engineering sector, as it is through them that we can obtain a whole range of technologies to upgrade our industrial sector. Germany has been expressing concern about the expiry of our bilateral investment treaty and the absence of a new one, but this can now only materialise through the India-EU FTA which is proving difficult to negotiate. Steinmeier has, during his visit, called for its early conclusion. India has always seen Germany as a most attractive technology partner. We have a High Technology Partnership Group (HTPG) for identifying specific opportunities for high technology collaboration under the “Make in India” programme, in particular in areas of skill development, defence manufacturing, machine tools, maritime technology and the blue economy. Possibilities of cooperation in the field of Industry 4.0, which covers automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, is being explored. Germany has great expertise in the area of Vocational Education and Training for which a joint working group exists. India’s railway modernisation and expansion plans offer considerable opportunities for the German rail industry. Renewable energies and sustainable urban development are other major areas of India-German cooperation. So is higher education. Germany is keen to receive more Indian students (currently 15,000 in number). At over 3,40,000, the number of foreign students in Germany grew by 36 per cent between 2012 and 2016, with Chinese students numbering at over 32,000 forming the largest contingent. Germany’s active consideration of an Indian proposal for a MoU on mutual recognition of qualifications will certainly enhance student exchanges. It is with a similar objective in mind that during Macron’s visit India and France agreed to give mutual recognition to academic degrees. Steinmeier’s visit has taken place in the context of major global uncertainties created by US policies under Donald Trump, the unveiling of China’s hegemonic ambitions on land and sea under a more authoritarian regime, the looming threats of protectionism and trade wars, strains within Europe, the Brexit blow to the European project and so on. Europe as the world’s largest economic and trading block, espousing democratic and pluralistic values and attached to an open multilateral trading system, finds a rising India an increasingly congenial all-round partner. India is one of the few countries with which Germany has institutionalised summit level biennial inter-governmental consultations. Inversely, India values a strong relationship with Europe, given that it is India’s leading trade, investment and technological partner, and closer ties with Europe gives more balance to our foreign policy, especially when balance of power politics is re-surfacing at the international level. With Brexit, Germany, with France, has become more central to the process of rejuvenating Europe, and this therefore requires that we have stronger understandings with it. Germany’s concerns about China’s threat to the liberal international order, including through its state-driven Belt and Road Initiative, are rising. It is beginning to pay serious attention to the expansion of China in the Indian Ocean. In his address at the Delhi University, Steinmeier offered German support to ensure freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean, which he considered important for Germany’s stability and prosperity. Shared values have acquired more foreign policy salience to counter the disruptive state-driven authoritarian model China is seeking to propagate internationally. Steinmeier, therefore, pointedly mentioned that he intentionally chose democratic India for his first longer trip to Asia. A little surprisingly he cautioned India against BRICS as a grouping that seeks to challenge the existing international structures when reforming them would be a better choice. Refreshingly, he cautioned against the “responsibility to protect” becoming a pretext for new interventionism. All in all, Steinmeier’s visit will have contributed to stronger strategic and economic India-Germany ties.

460,Manish Dubey,"Recent developments suggest that Narendra Modi and his BJP can no longer afford to be sanguine about their prospects in the next parliamentary elections. Yes, there was an impressive win in Tripura less than a month ago, but that is a state with just two parliamentary constituencies, and the news from elsewhere is far from encouraging. The BJP saved its Gujarat bastion with some difficulty in December 2017 and has lost all but one of the 13 parliamentary and Assembly by-elections held in 2018. The reverses have happened both in states where it was optimistic about maintaining its edge over the Opposition (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh and those where it had hoped to make major inroads (Odisha and West Bengal). Another perhaps more significant portent of the changing political wind comes from the evolving stances of regional and smaller parties. BJP allies from several states have either jumped ship recently or have begun making dissonant noises, two formidable regional opponents who seemed irreconcilable till not too long ago are inching closer to each other in UP, a federal front is being talked about, and the wily Sharad Pawar has begun exploring viable anti-BJP groupings. While the chatterati have the luxury of dismissing realignment conversations as signs of political desperation and opportunism, the BJP will take these lightly at its own peril. Even the smallest allies had a key contribution to the 2014 result, both in terms of magnifying the Modi aura and influencing votes in many more constituencies than their allotted strongholds, and their exit will hurt. More importantly, regional and small parties usually have their ears closer to the ground, and their growing openness to considering non-BJP options suggests that they may be sniffing a change in voter mood. There are three related axes around which the anti-BJP conversation is shaping up. The first focuses on puncturing the exaggerated claims of the Modi government and its all-round failure in delivering ""achhe din"", a line the Congress took with some success in Gujarat. The second dwells on the Modi government’s callous attitude to regional aspirations and its unfair treatment of regional Opposition-led states, the factors said to be behind the Telugu Desam Party’s exit from the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s federal front initiative. The third relates to a strong anti-democratic strain in the functioning of the ruling party and government, with sweeping decisions such as demonetisation taken without much consultation, Opposition leaders being hounded, much energy being devoted to sabotaging Opposition governments and installing BJP/NDA state governments even after electoral rejection, and meddling in the working of constitutional and other authorities. Together, these have spawned concern across the Opposition spectrum and encouraged some unlikely team-ups. The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party tie-up for the UP by-elections has made the most news, but there are others too. The Andhra Pradesh-Telangana parties, though not exactly friends, are on the same side as far as special status state demands go, KCR is hobnobbing with Mamata Banerjee, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha has reached an understanding with the Congress, and the Left joined Pawar’s Save Constitution march in Mumbai. Not everyone of these has the potential to mature into a firm coalition, but there is enough in them to suggest that the road ahead for the BJP has more showstoppers than before. The BJP may have its defence against the mounting criticism it faces on grounds of non-performance, regional neglect and anti-democratic attitude, but the fact of the matter is that these have emerged as the principal themes around which the anti-BJP sentiment is coalescing. As for how and why these emerged, much of the blame must go to the Modi-Amit Shah duo.     The BJP’s top two have made no secret of their Congress-mukt Bharat agenda or their desire for a longer stint in the government, ostensibly to realise a ""new India"". Political ambition itself is not exceptionable, but the Modi-Shah duo’s chosen approach is. For their plans to continue in power appear to rely less on demonstrated performance, more on headline management, a systematic crippling of the Opposition, and projection of their electoral record as a popular vindication of positions and endorsement of performance (Notably, the BJP has never spared the Congress for the propaganda and Opposition stiflement the grand old party resorted to in its heydays, and its position on electoral record smacks of duplicity. If the BJP’s election wins reflect the people’s approval of what it is doing, surely the Congress must have performed extremely well for it to have ruled the roost for decades.) The Modi-Shah recipe, viewing the party more as an election machine than an instrument of governance, has driven the BJP to high-voltage propaganda and riding roughshod over regional sentiment and established democratic proprieties. The three attack themes the Opposition has now found - and the new alignments being contemplated to counter the BJP threat - were inevitable with it. Modi’s carefully crafted larger than life persona is another reason for the kind of Opposition build-up being witnessed. In painting Modi as a hugely popular, unassailable political mastermind, and Modi himself seriously invested in perpetuating the image, the BJP has hastened the process of self-reflection across various Opposition parties and given a certain credibility to charges of self-aggrandisement and totalitarianism against Modi. It is likely that the Opposition would have remained less creative in its approach and hobbled by past baggage had the prospect of a Modi-led hegemony not been pitched so strongly. It is strange then that the men and strategies that catapulted the BJP to parliamentary majority and have delivered several important Assembly election wins since should emerge as the party’s weak links now. But then, as Shah himself says, every election is different and the past matters little.  ",2018-03-27,"Lok Sabha elections 2019,BJP,Modi-Shah,United Opposition",Blame Modi-Amit Shah for helping Opposition unite against BJP,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bjp-modi-shah-opposition-lok-sabha-2019-nda-tdp-ysrcp-sharad-pawar-congress-sp-bsp/story/1/23110.html
461,Ashok K Singh,"The controversy over breach of Facebook data and its likely misuse by Cambridge Analytica for influencing elections should have made Prime Minister Narendra Modi pause for a while. The exposé and allegations that prime minister's NaMo app leaked users' data to a US-based company in serious violation of privacy laws should have deterred Modi. The NaMo app exposé is far more serious than the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal because the former concerns the official mobile app of the prime minister himself. Some media repots have verified and confirmed that data of over five million people was shared with a foreign company. Congress president Rahul Gandhi was the first to go off the bloc to charge Modi with data leak. In a Twitter post Rahul likened Modi to ""the Big Boss"" who was spying on the Indian people. He claimed that the NaMo app secretly records video, audio, mobile numbers and email ids of users. Also, the mobile numbers and email id of 1.3 million NCC cadets, who downloaded the app, has been compromised. 
 
 
 
 
 
 BJP's IT cell chief Amit Malviya hit back saying Congress shared the data of party's app users with ""friends"" in Singapore. 
 
 But even as political slugfests, allegations and counter allegations continue over misuse of Facebook data and data through NaMo app, Modi has asked BJP MPs to redouble their efforts on Facebook. It defies logic that Modi should have asked each party MP to generate at least   on their Facebook page as a yardstick of their performance and to connect with voters amid the raging controversy over Facebook in India and abroad. Modi's advice to BJP MPs came at a dinner party on Friday. Modi even offered incentives telling MPs that he would hold live video calls with party workers in their constituencies if they, reached the 300,000 targets. What's funny is that Modi asked MPs to get ""genuine"" likes and not likes ""bought"" through marketing companies offering such services. Well, he should know that allegations of ""paid"" Facebook and Twitter followers have chased him since he became prime minister. There is nothing wrong per se in asking MPs to increase their presence on Facebook and other social media platforms. Social media helps parliamentarians connect with their voters who are young and active users of Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. However, there are two issues of concerns here. One, it shows Modi's fascination with and his overdependence on social media and app-based platforms to connect with the people at the cost of traditional, time-tested personal methods of communication. Two, Modi is not concerned about the likely misuse of data, and protecting the privacy of people at a time when Facebook is embroiled in a raging worldwide scandal over Cambridge Analytica. The prime minister is not bothered that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are accused of breach of data for election fixing and political purposes in India too. Modi must ask his law and IT minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, to take note and see how Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday took out full- page ads in British and American newspapers to apologise for the ""breach of trust"" in the scandal. 
 
 What happened to Ravi Shankar Prasad's bravado on  ? Why has Zuckerberg ignored India's concern over ""breach of trust""? But how can Modi be tough on Facebook when he supports millions of genuine and fake accounts, and army of trolls to derive political mileage? Modi's advice to party MPs to work hard to get at least 3,00,000 likes also reflects distortions and misplaced priorities of the current political discourse in the country. The two main political parties - the BJP and the Congress - have diverted their attention to wooing voters through social media platforms more than through traditional methods of making contacts. Instead of asking their MPs to visit their constituencies to solve the problems of the people, they are being encouraged to spend time on smart phones. The lure of ""likes"" can be irresistible for Modi and Rahul as over 10 million or one crore new voters will be eligible to cast votes in 2019. However, they forget that the power of mass mobilisation through grass-root contacts with people who are dissatisfied with government's performance can be more effective in redressal of problems and appearing concerned. It's obvious Modi and other political parties haven't learnt their lessons from the recent Farmers Long March of Maharashtra and the JNU's faculty and students' determined protests in Delhi. The way farmers and students reclaimed the streets and the manner in which farmers brought the BJP-Shiv Sena government to its heel portends a dangerous signal for the government in the run-up to the 2019 general election. Farmers of Maharashtra showed the way when they marched for a week from Nasik under the blistering sun to reach Mumbai to lodge their protest. The BJP government understood the anger of over 40,000 farmers and agreed to meet their demands. Students and teachers of JNU faced police lathi charge, water cannons, in which many, including female students sustained injuries, to protest against the authoritarian conduct of the university administration. Modi should be wary of the rising discontent of students, farmers and workers in informal sectors. Their discontent has begun to boil over and is turning into anger. The anger was reflected in the results of the by-elections in UP and Bihar and Rajasthan. Social media can help drive the election campaign but in a limited way.

462,Seemi Pasha,"The Delhi High Court’s decision - setting aside the   and referring the matter back to the Election Commission - has come as a huge relief to the party, to say the least. The poll panel on January 19 had recommended disqualification of the MLAs for holding offices of profit. The AAP was quick to hit out at the poll panel, questioning its integrity and accusing it for pushing the BJP’s agenda. Here’s a look at what the office of profit case is all about. On March 13, 2015, the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government passed an order appointing 21 of its party MLAs as parliamentary secretaries. The Delhi government claimed that the MLAs will not take any remuneration and, therefore, their positions don’t come under the ambit of the office of profit. The appointments were made to pacify MLAs who felt betrayed on being left out of the cabinet. It wasn’t possible for Kejriwal to include more ministers because of a constitutional amendment that puts a cap on the number of ministerial berths to 15 per cent of the strength of the House. The AAP government, which had a brute majority of 67 MLAs in the 70-member House, then retrospectively passed a bill, excluding parliamentary secretaries from the ambit of the office of profit law.  For the bill to become a law, the AAP government had to get an approval from the then president of India Pranab Mukherjee, who, in June 2016, withheld his assent on the advice of the Union home and law ministries. Advocate Prashant Patel then filed a petition before the president asking for disqualification of the MLAs holding offices of profit. The president, in turn, asked the Election Commission for an opinion on whether or not to disqualify the MLAs. The EC said the petition was maintainable and that it would look into the matter. Fearing trouble from the EC, the AAP government in August 2017, tried to obtain a stay on the poll panel's proceedings from the Delhi High Court. The high court, however, observed that since the EC had not started is deliberations, there was no possibility of staying them. On January 19, the Election Commission recommended that 20 AAP MLAs who were occupying the position of parliamentary secretaries should be disqualified. The Constitution prohibits legislators and parliamentarians from holding any position with monetary or other benefits. This clause known as the office of profit - is aimed at reducing conflict of interest situations for elected representatives. However, there is no official definition of ""office of profit"" and it is at the discretion of the relevant authority to decide whether any particular post is such an office. The Supreme Court has also made a few observations on what defines an office of profit and observed that an office should have receivables attached to it to qualify as the same. The Aam Aadmi Party has firmly maintained that the MLAs received no benefits in the form of vehicles, bungalow or salary for the position of parliamentary secretary, but whether or not they were able to exercise influence because of the position is something that remains debatable.  The Delhi High Court’s order has come at a time when the AAP is battling Opposition parties on one hand and the Modi government on the other. Its recent spats with the Centre, including the controversy surrounding the alleged assault on the Delhi chief secretary by AAP MLAs, has cast a shadow on the party’s image. Despite clarifications by the top leadership, the public's perception of the AAP seemed to be sliding. The alleged midnight assault on Delhi’s top bureaucrat followed by the commotion inside the secretariat, where AAP ministers and their aides were assaulted, had people wondering what kind of government they had voted for. Of late, Kejriwal has also been seen eating humble pie with a spree of apologies. With 33 defamation cases filed against him in 22 states, the AAP chief seemed to have decided that saying sorry was the easiest way out. On March 15, he apologised to Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia for accusing him of being involved in drug trade. Surprisingly, Majithia accepted the apology and withdrew the defamation case. The apology, however, left many in the party miffed. As the Opposition ridiculed Kejriwal for apologising to his rivals, it emerged that the Delhi CM had written a letter to Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, expressing ""regret"" over naming the BJP leader in the Aam Aadmi Party's list of ""India's most corrupt"".  The very next day, Kejriwal and Gadkari submitted a joint application to Patiala House court seeking withdrawal of the defamation case. His next apology was directed towards senior counsel and Kapil Sibal’s son Amit Sibal. Kejriwal had alleged conflict of interest over Amit Sibal appearing for telecom major Vodafone in the apex court when his father was the Union communication minister. His apology was only duly accepted. With that, Kejiwal's public image took a severe beating. The high court’s decision to set aside the Election Commission’s recommendation and the presidential notification has come as oxygen for the Aam Admi Party, which desperately needed to send out a positive message to the people of Delhi. While Kejriwal may continue his apology spree, the party hopes that he won't be seen a weak leader, but as a politician who is willing to compromise with his ego for the good of the party.",2018-03-23,"Arvind Kejriwal,Disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs,Office of Profit,AAP",Why Arvind Kejriwal will cut a 'sorry' figure despite Delhi HC quashing disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-mlas-disqualification-delhi-high-court-arvind-kejriwal-apology-office-of-profit-ec-bjp/story/1/23042.html
463,Rahul Noronha,"In what is clearly a dangerous trend, the police in Madhya Pradesh have turned judge, jury and executioner in certain matters pertaining to law and order. This comes on the heels of the chief minister threatening top officers with transfers if they are unable to control crime within their jurisdiction. Videos of police personnel letting women thrash history-sheeters are doing the rounds on social media. But very surprisingly, no one seems to be questioning these acts of the citizenry to take the law into their own hands at the behest of the police. Why is the citizenry craving instant justice? Perhaps because of the inaction of the same police that is delivering it now. It all began last week when a 19-year-old girl, a BCom student at a local college in Bhopal, committed suicide. Her family said she was being harassed by Danish, a youth who lived close by. The girl had complained to the police but action had not been taken. One day, when Danish allegedly slapped her for not responding to his overtures, she went home and committed suicide. MP’s record in crimes against women is deplorable. The state is at the  every year in the “Crime In India” report brought out by the National Crime Records Bureau in so far as crimes against women go. The  , along the railway tracks in the heart of the city some months ago, had led the CM to transfer a number of cops from the capital. The suicide by the 19-year-old last week prompted the Congress to stage agitations against the state’s law and order situation. The CM then convened a meeting of DMs, SPs, IGs and commissioners, and told them that he only cared for results — not really the means — and a campaign against anti-social elements should be launched. With a “I mean business” face, Chouhan told the officials via video-conferencing that he wanted “action-action-action” or else they would be removed from their posts. In Bhopal, videos surfaced of police personnel making historysheeters walk on the streets. Cops then invited women standing by to slap those who had been rounded up. Many women willingly obliged, raining blows on chained boys. The police also began a campaign with the municipal corporation to demolish encroachments by criminals. There was hardly a murmur of protest by anyone against what was being done. No one knew why the boys were thrashed by the public at the behest of the police — it was like a movie scene straight out of a dystopian setting. No one questioned that if they were hardened criminals, as the police claimed they were, why were they out on the streets in the first place, and who was responsible for that? The citizenry is perhaps so helpless about criminals having a field day that no one wants to know whether they are getting a fair trial or not. Any armed force with unbridled powers can be a threat to the functioning of a civilised society, but right now, this is merely a concept that the “human rights wallahs” talk about. The IPS cadre used this opportunity to demand the introduction of the police commissioner system, wherein the police have magisterial powers. The IPS cadre in MP, whenever questioned about the law and order, use the absence of the commissioner system as a reason and suggest that as the panacea for all ills. Well, if this is what they want it for, the present encouragement by the police for nudging the citizenry to take law into their own hands should be the biggest argument against the police commissioner system. Also, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan has held the reins of the state for the last 13 years. He would do well to introspect why, and under whose watch, have matters come to this point.

464,Mandabya JJ,"The egalitarian nature of the Union of India has always been a volatile topic, both for political parties and secessionist interests alike. With democracy allowing political expressions of regional aspirations, each region clamouring for equality of status is common. The  , led by the enigmatic Tamil Nadu (as enigmatic as its illustrious leaders), have especially complained of being ignored by those in power. And it is not an issue that crops up from time to time, but rather a continuous clamour for more recognition from those in power at the Centre. An example could be that of Dravidar Kazhagam general secretary K Veeramani recently complaining of the purported seclusion of his state, pointing at the Cauvery water dispute, or the furore surrounding the NEET exams. He hinted at the fact that not only was the Centre trying to wrest state powers, but also called for resistance from all southern states against the saffronisation of any institution.    Ever since the language debate in the Constituent Assembly, a feeling of neglect spread over the southern states, especially of those in the so-called “privileged north”. Ever since the adoption of Hindi as an official language, there were large-scale protests and resentment throughout southern India. And political parties, the DMK in particular, have been more than happy to play along, more for political gains than to actually change the situation. The DMK came into power in 1967 in Tamil Nadu mainly on that very issue, and has never relinquished its position ever since. With the current government in power, the issue of a separate “Dravid” state, comprising all southern states, has again come to light. Exactly 55 years since the  , in 1963, and in vein of CN Annadurai’s famous statement, “the reasons for a Dravida Nadu will continue to hold good”, MK Stalin has again raised the issue. But this no longer remains the alienation issue due to which the first time Dravida Nadu was proposed. There are various aspects in the present day to this issue. First, the continuous ignorance by the central government of  delegations from the DMK and other southern parties that has left a huge gap between the ground realities in the south and what the Centre envisions it to be. As acting president of the DMK,  , recently said, “As far as Dravida Nadu is concerned, Anna (CN Annadurai), gave up the idea, but also made it clear that the reasons for the demand for its creation are very much there. Anna has been proved right, especially now that we see how the southern states are being ignored by the BJP government”. Then comes the language issue. This is the hinge behind Dravida Nadu demands, and why that demand has sustained for so long. There is a feeling of deprivation in southern states about the imposition of Hindi on them. Ethnically, very few can call it their own tongue. A recent issue along similar lines arose in Karnataka when on Karnataka Rajyotsava, or Karnataka Day, celebrated every year on November 1, chief minister Siddaramaiah stated that all people living in Karnataka should learn  and not expect the locals to speak Hindi. This was followed by a directive by the state government to make Kannada compulsory in schools across Karnataka. Hidden in this resentment is a far greater factor, that of regional dominance. There has always been a sense of competition and rivalry between states in the south. This is especially apparent between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, who have clashed most violently over the division of the  . “Dravida Nadu” was to be led by Tamil Nadu, and that itself defeats the cause for the other southern states. Also, in the contemporary sense, the Dravidian identity has transformed, from a congregation of southern states as one having similar demands to that of separate nationalities based on language. And this point itself is significant, as Dravida Nadu was to be a singular unified demand, not fragmented requirements of different states. Add to that the constant bickering among the states, with water being the main bone of contention. Nevertheless, the idea of “Dravida Nadu” holds firm since the common masses identify with the ideas behind the demand. No matter how utopian the demand for a separate ""Dravid"" state is, national politics and the direction in which the Centre-state relations are heading, it might become a reality sooner than later.",2018-03-23,"North-South divide,Karnataka,Tamil Nadu,Dravida Nadu",Why the chances of Dravida Nadu are no longer illusory,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/dravida-nadu-dmk-stalin-siddaramaiah-tamil-nadu-karnataka-hindi-imposition-north-south/story/1/23040.html
465,Praveen Shekhar,"The BJP's shocking defeat in by-elections to two parliamentary constituencies in Uttar Pradesh and one in Bihar seems to have thrown the 2019 Lok Sabha contest wide open. Although a year is still to go for the Lok Sabha polls, the impact of the by-poll results has spurred political brainstorming in the southern states. The next six months will be very crucial. How successful are the two major parties - the BJP and the Congress - in stitching up pre-poll alliance with regional parties and the understanding that will emerge for post-poll cooperation, will decide the fate and face of 2019 elections. The five southern states - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala - and one union territory of Puducherry together sends 130 MPs to the Lok Sabha. Despite the Modi wave in 2014, the BJP won just 20 seats from the region, just one seat more than its main rival Congress party. So, it is important to figure out, how different will the picture be in 2019 as far as the southern states are concerned. Due to rapidly changing political mood in the south, both the Congress and the BJP will have to work hard to forge alliances with regional parties, whose importance, over the years, have increased. National politics subsequently got marginalised because of the regional aspirations of the major political parties. In the old ""coalition-dharma"" there was an unwritten agreement that the regional parties would focus only on the state Assembly elections and the remaining political space will be left for the national parties. But, in the last few elections, there has been reversal in the trend. Ever since 1996, when non-Congress and non-BJP governments came into existence at the Centre, the regional parties have realised their strength. But that experiment pushed the country towards political instability. Within two years, India saw three prime ministers and eventually the country had to go for another general election. However, this did not diminish national parties’ regional aspirations. Of the 20 seats that the BJP won in 2014, 17 of them were from Karnataka alone. The urban areas of the state, especially Bangalore and Mysore, and coastal areas had supported the BJP. This was possible even when the state had a Congress government under Siddaramaiah since May 2013. The chief minister had to face the Modi wave, and therefore, he could manage to bring only nine seats to his party’s account. However, in the run-up to the Assembly election in the state, Siddaramaiah seems to have an upper hand over his BJP rival BS Yeddyurappa. That's because the BJP has kept its election campaign completely focussed on Narendra Modi’s charisma. Siddaramaiah, on the other hand, despite facing anti-incumbency is aggressively pursuing his social engineering by trying to consolidate Ahinda (Kannada acronym for dalits, backward classes and minorities) vote bank and invoking ""Kannada pride"" - the state’s own national anthem and flag. To be held next month, the Karnataka elections will be keenly watched as it will set the stage for 2019 Lok Sabha polls for both the parties - the BJP and the Congress. At this stage, the fate of the regional parties in the state is still unclear. While former prime minister HD Deve Gowda's Janata Dal(S) has lost much of its steam and sheen, Siddaramaiah though considered a tall Congress leader in Karnataka, his image remains restricted to that of a regional satrap. In the 2014 general elections, the BJP had won two seats in Andhra Pradesh and one in Telangana. The BJP may have won 20 seats on its own in the south, but it had benefited allies on 73 seats. In Andhra Pradesh, the BJP's then ally, Telugu Desam Party (TDP), had won 16 seats and MPs and MLAs of both the parties shared power in both the governments. But now there is a crack in this friendship. Raising the issue of ""Andhra pride"", the TDP has come out of the BJP-led NDA. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu has accused the central government of not fulfilling its promise of granting special status to Andhra Pradesh. Clearly, competitive politics forced the TDP to quit the NDA since opposition leader Jaganmohan Reddy has been continuously accusing Naidu for not protecting the interests of the state. In Andhra Pradesh, political observers believe, the BJP is staring at a loss because the wind seems to be blowing in Naidu's direction. Until the next year's elections, the demand for special category status for Andhra Pradesh will remain a burning issue with the state facing both Lok Sabha and the assembly elections together. Post-elections, the only hope for the NDA is Naidu, who has for long has adopted an anti-Congress stand. In the meantime, the BJP's attempt to befriend Jaganmohan Reddy has failed. In Telangana, TRS supremo Chandrasekhar Rao is engaged in working out the possibility of forming a non-BJP, non-Congress Third Front. Although he is more close to the BJP than the Congress, he feels the pulse of the people is against the Centre and that is why he will have to adopt a different kind of political posture. In 2014, the TRS won 11 Lok Sabha seats. In Tamil Nadu, there is a political vacuum after J Jayalalitha's (AIADMK) death, and M Karunanidhi (DMK) not keeping well. The BJP is trying hard to cobble up an alliance with various groups, including Rajinikanth's, but has not succeeded so far. BJP’s vote percentage in Kerala has increased, but it is still far away from securing seats. In Puducherry, the Congress is in power. Suffice it to say, both the national parties will have to either convince regional parties for a pre-poll alliance or will have to open their doors for post-poll unions to strengthen their prospects for the next year’s general elections.    ",2018-03-21,"Karnataka Assembly polls,Congress,BJP,Lok Sabha polls 2019",Why southern states are crucial for 2019 Lok Sabha elections,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/lok-sabha-2019-bjp-congress-karnataka-assembly-polls-up-bypoll-results-siddaramiah-naidu/story/1/22991.html
466,Minhaz Merchant,"Two states will determine the outcome of the  : Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Between them they account for 128 seats in the Lok Sabha. The BJP-led NDA won 114 of those 128 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha poll. Now India's two biggest states spell danger in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's bid to win a second term. The alliance between the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party is mathematically irresistible. Together the two parties command over 50 per cent of the state's vote share across Yadavs, Jatav Dalits and Muslims. In 2014, the BJP won  ; its ally Apna Dal won another two seats, making it an unprecedented sweep of 73 seats. The BSP was wiped out; SP won five ""family"" seats (the extended Mulayam Singh Yadav parivar) and the Congress its two old fiefs of Rae Bareli (Sonia Gandhi) and Amethi (Rahul Gandhi). Following the success of their one-off alliance in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the BSP and SP are certain to join forces for the Lok Sabha poll. Old enmities have been swept under the carpet. The Congress will join the SP-BSP grand alliance to ensure the anti-BJP vote isn't split. The math looks good on the surface but three factors could dilute the alchemy between the anti-BJP forces. First, seat sharing. To carve out their respective shares from 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state is the first hurdle SP and BSP will face. Seat allocations can be messy and cause serious disruptions between aspiring Lok Sabha candidates. The second factor is the SP and BSP's vote silos. They are not necessarily fungible. Old resentments between the two cadres remain strong. When campaigning, friendly fights can't be ruled out. The third hurdle is the danger of reverse consolidation. As UP's voters see old enemies SP and BSP cynically forging an alliance to stop Narendra Modi, with the discredited Congress playing matchmaker, polarisation amidst a Modi vs The Rest battle could set in. Voters know that the SP-BSP-Congress coalition of 2019 will be unviable in the next state Assembly election in 2022. Neither Mayawati nor Akhilesh Yadav will cede the chief ministership to the other in the 403-seat UP assembly. If an alliance for the 2019 Lok Sabha poll is seen as a one-off to stop Modi, it could coalesce the Brahmin, Thakur and OBC vote in favour of the BJP. And yet, the damage to the BJP's seat tally in 2019 will be significant. In the Gorakhpur parliamentary by-poll last week, the BJP's vote share fell to 47 per cent (from 52 per cent in the 2014 Lok Sabha election). The SP-BSP coalition vote share rose to 49 per cent, edging out the BJP by just over 21,000 votes. In Phulpur (Jawaharlal Nehru's old constituency), a similar pattern was visible. In 2014, with BSP and SP fighting separately, the BJP had swept to victory with 52.50 per cent vote share. Last week, faced with the BSP-SP alliance, the BJP's vote share dropped to 39 per cent. The BSP-SP combination forged ahead with 47 per cent vote share and won by nearly 60,000 votes. Uttar Pradesh is not the BJP's only worry. Maharashtra accounts for the second largest number of Lok Sabha seats: 48. In 2014, the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance swept 41 seats. BJP won 23 seats and Shiv Sena 18. An embittered Sena poses a serious challenge to the BJP's chances of repeating its 2014 landslide in the state. It has a dedicated cadre on the ground. In an election, it can be a formidable force. That is why Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis swallows the Sena's daily taunts against the BJP. If Shiv Sena contests the 2019 Lok Sabha poll in a loose alliance with the Congress and NCP, the BJP could be in real trouble. The Sena's Hindutva jars on the Congress and NCP but both will welcome nudge-and-wink seat adjustments with  . The ill-feeling between the cadres of the BJP and Shiv Sena is so strong that the Sena could well ally with sworn enemies like the Congress and NCP just to defeat the BJP. The Sena's pathological dislike of Modi stems from Uddhav Thackeray's belief that the prime minister has snubbed him repeatedly over the past four years. Growing up under the shadow of his dominating father Bal Thackerary, Uddhav has a thin skin. Besides, the Sena regards itself as the original Hindutva party. The BJP's rise has cut the Sena's vote share in its home citadel. It not only won fewer seats than the BJP in Maharashtra in the 2014 Lok Sabha election (18 against 23) but also garnered just 63 seats to the BJP's 122 in the October 2014 state Assembly poll. It had to cede the chief ministership to Fadnavis. The Sena is also worried about its hold over the BMC, India's wealthiest civic body with an annual budget larger than some states. The Sena has 84 corporators in the BMC which it runs together with the BJP's 82 corporators. If the BJP's electoral momentum in Maharashtra continues, the Sena could in future be reduced to a small player in the BMC, among the most corrupt and incompetent municipalities in India. The Sena is, therefore, prepared to ally with rivals Congress and NCP in 2019 to weaken the BJP, even though it could mean cutting its nose to spite its face, in order to maintain its hold on the BMC's cash machine. The BJP meanwhile is in binary contests with the Congress in five big states: Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka. Together, they account for 118 Lok Sabha seats. In 2014, the BJP won 105 of those 118 seats. Given strong anti-incumbency, that tally too is set to fall. The math is stark. Seven states gave the NDA 219 of its 282 Lok Sabha seats in 2014: UP 73, Maharashtra 41, Gujarat 26, Rajasthan 25, MP 27, Chhattisgarh 10 and Karnataka 17. The extent of losses from these seven states will make or mar Modi's bid for a second term. The northeast, Odisha and the south will deliver additional seats to the NDA but nowhere near enough to make up for the losses in the seven key states which, led by UP and Maharashtra, will decide the outcome of the 2019 Lok Sabha election.",2018-03-21,"UP Assembly Polls,Congress,BJP,2019 general elections",Why Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra will decide BJP's fate in 2019,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/2019-general-elections-bjp-congress-up-assembly-polls-maharashtra-lok-sabha/story/1/22986.html
467,Harmeet Shah Singh,"Seven years ago, the world was swept by a wave of public protests. It was a season of movements that harnessed popular frustration. Joined by tech-savvy middle-classes, millions of activists took to the streets of New York, London, Tel Aviv and New Delhi in what was a global outpouring of contempt for systemic issues - inequality, greed, corruption, dictators and fanaticism. Let's take a look at what they achieved or didn't after they faded. Authoritarian leaders such as Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia fell in the wake of the Arab uprisings but many Middle Eastern countries beset by regionalised wars in the years that followed cracked down on freedom of speech and restored autocracies. Since its launch in September, 2011, the New York-based Occupy Wall Street movement against corporate malfeasance fizzled out within months, leaving critics to wonder what it really accomplished. Back home in India, veteran activist Anna Hazare held a series of hunger strikes around the same time. He drew tens of millions of people in what became a glaring reflection of the country's growing intolerance of corruption, arrogance and unresponsive leadership. Public anger eventually translated into votes against the national government and for what was then perceived to be a dynamic, pro-development and a grassroots politician, Narendra Modi. Both the Arab Spring and Hazare's protests shared some common features, if not all. Both called for greater transparency, social justice and economic opportunities. Both sought to change existing governance structures. But both failed to deliver a roadmap for protecting, building and restoring faith in democratic institutions once the change is realised. Little wonder, the results have been bitter. Political expansionism spurred largely by casteist and anti-minority acts has become the hallmark of the BJP rule since 2014. Party leaders could be heard almost every day on TV bragging about what's now called ""saffron surge"" under Modi in a tone that smacks of the RSS' ultimate goal of a theocratic Hindu Rashtra. If it's democracy, why major elections have to be preceded by low-scale riots or public lynching of Muslim cattle traders or heavily-loaded sectarian rhetoric promoting aggressive upper-caste hegemony disguised as Hindutva? Ours indeed is a democracy defined by a Constitution that separates legislative, executive and judicial powers. The federal structure ideally requires greater empowerment of local and regional institutions of governance. But why has it then become ceremonial to plunge communities into a state of turmoil before almost every key election? Forget communities, even the economy - the lifeline of a 1.25-billion-strong population - was pushed into a dangerous chaos. A prime minister, who owed his ascension largely to the Anna Hazare mobilisation, emerges on night-time TV to announce an abrupt withdrawal of India's highest-denomination currency in a cash-driven system. How many elected leaders across the world have ever celebrated taxation? Ours did when he rolled out an ill-conceived GST in Parliament. Some critics call it a move to weaken federalism further, economically. The Hazare upheaval eventually produced a monarchical style of central leadership. Over the past four years, power has increasingly been concentrated into one man or a handful of them at the most. Secularism has been strategically downgraded as a vote-appeasement tactic and human and civil rights advocates undermined as terror sympathisers. In top gear are attempts to enforce the fundamental version of high-caste predominance packaged as Hindu nationalism. But the primary question is whether a country as vast as India prepared to embrace a parochial, inward-looking regime for good. A close analysis of the BJP's overly advertised successes in Northeast suggests the victory was primarily an outcome of shrewd mergers and acquisitions of locally-elected satraps. In the Hindi heartland, where the saffron noise is the loudest, the Hazare outcome has begun to disentangle. Recent by-elections in three states, Uttar Pradesh included, are more than an indication that India, crushed by the lopsided economic and federal policies of the Modi government, is rejecting monarchical brand of politics. Let alone minorities, dominant caste groups in states and the Dalits within the Hindu fold have called the BJP's Hindutva bluff. The Hazare protests probably still weigh heavily on the Indian psyche. Many of us believe regimes can only be toppled through mass agitations. The belief is erroneous in the second decade of the 21st century. Public movements of the scale of the Arab Spring are a passé globally. India is witnessing a silent rage. The key to unseating Modi lies in a unified Opposition. This grand alliance has to be region-based, by which I mean each of its member should allow a field wide-open to partners to take opponents head on in elections. So, if the RJD, for example, were to become part of this grouping in Bihar, it should not venture into UP to play spoilsport with the SP, the BSP and the Congress fighting Modi's BJP together in that state. A third, fourth or fifth front, likewise, will only end up dividing Opposition votes. Speculations that an Opposition alliance, as mooted by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, would not materialise over who would be its candidate for the top job in   are not convincing. Remember, Gandhi ruled herself out of the prime ministerial race and instead named Dr Manmohan Singh as head of the UPA government in 2004 when the BJP objected to her Italian origin. Her son, now the Congress president, appears contented. He might lack Modi's energy, but  seems to be gifted with a sense of fulfilment. It's hard to imagine he would stick stubbornly to the PM candidacy if allies disagree. The Modi wave has reached its saturation point for some profound reasons. Silence on Indian streets, the terrible pre-poll violence aside, isn't a barometer of the prime minister's popularity. On the contrary, it conceals a swelling undercurrent of disenchantment. Populism is over. Pragmatism in. And that's an opportunity for the Opposition to capitalise on, collectively.",2018-03-21,"Opposition alliance,Narendra Modi,Rahul Gandhi,2019 elections",India is witnessing a silent rage.

468,Shamsher Chandel,"The art of politics is best understood gradually in the corridors of power. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who said in a public rally in May 2013 that Bikram Singh Majithia was involved in a drug racket and issued defamatory statements against several politicians, faces 33 defamation cases. He is already   and many more could be on the way. But it is the apology to Majithia that has created fissures in the  . Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu says, ""I would be lying if I say there isn't a problem. Yes there are two-three splinter groups."" SAD(B) lost power in Punjab in 2017. And the issue to have driven the party out of power was the proliferation of drug racket in the state under the SAD(B)-BJP government. Youngsters getting hooked to drugs became a huge problem and everyone talked about it in Punjab. They still do. Majithia was in the centre of that drug storm. The drug storm helped AAP achieve something they probably wouldn't have been able to get otherwise: four Lok Sabha seats from Punjab in 2014 elections. It was one election where issues assumed greater importance than the leaders. And this brings us to the question of AAP leaders in Punjab. The party's rise in the state was akin to that in Delhi. It had sympathisers and leaders but no karyakartas or dedicated party workers. AAP in Punjab was full of leaders such as Sucha Singh Chhotepur, Harinder Singh Khalsa, Dharamvir Gandhi, and Bhagwant Mann to name a few. 
 
 The next lot of leaders were the disgruntled elements from other parties like Sukhpal Khaira from Congress. Despite the absence of party workers, and leaders coming together from opposing ideologies, AAP did well in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. In the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections too their presence was felt. So what did they base their victory on? Well, on the issue of youth getting hooked to drugs. When the allegations against Bikram Majithia came up in public discourse, Arvind Kejriwal lapped up the issue. Having won Delhi twice and with a victory of sorts in Punjab, the BJP and Congress privately conceded that AAP was a real looming threat. Many say, at that time, Kejriwal should have slithered up the political ladder quietly. Instead, he made himself look like a not-to-be-missed elephant in the room. Politicians, both from the Congress and the BJP went after him left, right and centre. Thirty-three defamation cases later, they have been successfully able to tame the elephant. CM Kejriwal has kept busy appearing for one or the other court hearing. Not just this. He is fighting a battle on another front. This one happens to be within the party. The Punjab unit of the party thinks that with Kejriwal's apology, AAP has lost the political ground they had captured in the state. The party had managed to breach into the Akali vote bank with the help of the drug issue. With a year or slightly more left for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, this apology is a dent to the image of AAP and the faith of voters, who placed their trust in AAP. What's unusual about Kejriwal slander? Hasn't such slander been part of Indian politics before? Yes, it has always been there. But the slugfest hardly reached courts. What explains the fact that Narendra Modi never took Sonia Gandhi to court for comments like ""Maut ka Saudagar"". Closer home, Sukhbir Badal never took Capt Amarinder Singh to court for being called a ""balungda"" (a kitten) or ""son of a gun"". Similarly, down south Karunanidhi called J Jayalalithaa the most corrupt woman, who smelt like a rotten egg. Such mudslinging in Indian politics is commonplace. But the Congress and BJP feared Kejriwal. The Punjab unit of the party thinks that they are inching closer to their big brothers in Delhi stature-wise. Punjab is the only state, other than Delhi, where AAP has shown promise. Thus it gives them the right to look Kejriwal in the eye. After the apology, AAP's Punjab unit president Bhagwant Mann and Aman Arora resigned and Kanwar Sandhu and Sukhpal Singh Khera were  . But that's where it ends. At this juncture Punjab does not offer any more alternatives for another political front, the exit of these leaders from the party would thus amount to hara-kiri. After all, Punjab already has a regional party based on quasi-religious tenets called the SAD(B), which exploits the sentiments of the voters on religious lines from time to time. Alongside them are their coalition partners, the BJP and then there is the Congress. The Bahujan Samaj Party could not make much ground despite the presence of 26 per cent Dalit/OBC votes in the state. Punjab People's Party under Manpreet Badal tried, but failed. AAP is the fourth party that has been successful in occupying the vacant political space, created due to the non-performance of SAD(B), the Sikh sympathisers, who never saw an alternative in Congress because of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. The only other alternative is these leaders could seek political career/refuge in other political parties. But most of the AAP leaders are not likely to stand on an equal footing with leaders who are already well entrenched in the BJP, SAD(B), Congress. Aman Arora or a Harjot Bains may find it hard to even get a ticket leave alone winning from any other party. Swaraj Abhiyan founder and former AAP leader Yogendra Yadav calls Kejriwal a dictator. So does Prashant Bhushan. But the dissidence expressed by the AAP MLAs in Punjab proves something to the contrary. AAP seems like a party which to the outsiders looks democratic to a fault. Could Amit Shah the BJP president or Congress supremo Rahul Gandhi have ever been challenged in their respective parties? The answer is no. In fact the problem stems from the fact that AAP borrowed or rather converted former bosses in different fields into political leaders. The first crop of AAP leaders were leaders in their own right - former IAS officers, newspaper editors, lawyers, bankers, social workers, poets, psephologists, industrialists and comedians. They had the confidence that comes from facing the big stage and speaking to the gallery. They peppered the day-to-day politics with experiences and assets of their own fields and expertise. They took established political parties head-on. The next lot of leaders were the disgruntled elements from other parties. It won't be inappropriate to borrow a term from journalism and call many of these politicians including Kejriwal, ""freelance politicians"". While Kejriwal may have an ideology, which seemingly is Left liberal, most Punjab leaders do not. Bhagwant Mann, is a former comedian, who still uses the art in public speeches. His speeches reflect art but not an ideology. Kanwar Sandhu is a former newspaper editor, who knows Punjab like the back of his hand. But that was journalism and this is politics. The only man who fits the bill of a politician is Sukhpal Khera, a former Congressman. But has he shed the Congress ideology or does he still carry it? The rest of them are freelance leaders, who want the good of the state but can't really lay down the roadmap for it. They need an issue to bank upon, probably another drug storm.",2018-03-20,"Apology,Punjab,Drug menace,Congress",Arvind Kejriwal's apology to Majithia: What it means for AAP in Punjab,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/arvind-kejriwal-bikram-singh-majithia-congress-drug-menace-punjab-apology/story/1/22944.html
469,Sharat Pradhan,"The ruling BJP's humiliating defeat in the two Lok Sabha by-elections in Gorakhpur and Phulpur may not have mellowed down chief minister  , who went ahead with loud celebrations to mark the completion of his first year in office here on Monday (March 19). However, a noticeable dissenting voice emerged from none other than cabinet minister Om Prakash Rajbhar, who heads Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party, a BJP ally. Even though the ally has only four members in Uttar Pradesh’s 403-member Assembly where the BJP has an overwhelming strength of 324, Rajbhar’s audacity to speak up cannot be underscored. 
 
 Rajbhar has blasted Yogi and his government on every count for which the chief minister was busy patting his own back - be it the state’s much-debated law and order , the much-hyped ""development"", all the loud talk about welfare of farmers, claims of creation of employment, healthcare and the overall well-being of the common people. Just as Yogi was gloating over his one-year’s “achievements” and was presiding over a jamboree organised in the opulent Rs 600-crore Lok Bhawan, built as the chief minister’s new office by his rival predecessor Akhilesh Yadav, a ""rebel"" Rajbhar got down to running him down, blow by blow. Keeping himself away from the celebrations - marked by colourful dance and music - Rajbhar went on record to express his strong reservations against the overall working of the Yogi government. ""We had decided to join hands with the BJP not for holding such extravaganza, but in the larger interest of the well-being of the deprived and backward castes who could never get the benefit of the 27 per cent reservation that was hogged away by a few privileged OBCs only,"" he said. ""Even though one year has passed, the BJP has failed to keep its promise of giving these deprived castes such as Rajbhars, Binds, Kevats, Prajapatis, Lohars, etc, their due; as it stands today, we have not been able to even ensure issue of rations cards to them, not to talk about things like building toilets in their homes or other such welfare schemes,"" he lamented. Accusing Yogi Adityanath of being focused only on building temples, Rajbhar felt ""the CM's priorities are all mixed up and more than anything else, he is only interested in building temples - even at the cost of igniting violence between communities"". He questioned Yogi’s oft-repeated claims on law and order and asked: ""Not a single day passed when there wasn't a major crime. How is law and order under control or better than it was under the previous regime? Where is the change? Yet, the chief minister is busy proclaiming that he has transformed the state. I am not ready to buy all that.” Rajbhar appears to be further cut up with the BJP because Amit Shah has not bothered to give him an audience that he was seeking. ""Now if Amit Shah does not meet me, my party will boycott the Rajya Sabha election, we will just not go to vote,"" he asserted while issuing an indirect threat that could affect the fate of the BJP’s ninth candidate for the Rajya Sabha poll. Twelve months ago, when Yogi Adityanath became the chief minister, there were lot of expectations from him. After all, that was for the first time in the history of the state that a saffron-clad sadhu-turned-politician was elevated to the coveted office. Yogi’s clean image together with the reputation of a taskmaster led everyone to believe that the country’s most-populous state would witness a transformation . However, what actually happened during this period was a lot of lip service and very little result on ground. Taking advantage of his loud and assertive ways, Yogi was out to impress upon all and sundry that all was hunky-dory in the state. Simply by unleashing a spate of 1,100-odd encounters, that led to the killing of a few “innocents” too, the chief minister felt, he had brought the law and order under control. He did not even care to check that quite a few of the 43 who were actually gunned down in these encounters, were not really hardened criminals. The chief minister may be claiming that each of those killed in the encounters were criminals carrying rewards on their heads, but the fact of the matter was that in some cases, the reward was announced barely a few days before the encounter. Some were shot soon after they were granted bail by courts. A high-profile Investor’s Summit organised in Lucknow last month for several hundred crores of rupees, gave Yogi the handle to proclaim the promise of a Rs 5 lakh crore investment in the state. He chose to conveniently overlook that similar tall promises had been made by the same industrial house during previous regimes. And he also did not care to find out how many of the same investors had committed similar investment in other states, where similar summits were held over the past few months. Significantly, the chief minister continues to remain in denial over the death of 70 children due to lack of oxygen in the medical college in his own Gorakhpur city, from where won five consecutive elections. The neglect of the city is visible in the stink on account of filth and squalor, that has become the breeding ground for the deadly Japanese encephalitis virus that has been perennially taking lives of thousands of children. Ironically, while Yogi was busy announcing the launch of an anti-corruption portal to get a grip over the rampant corruption in the government, Om Prakash Rajbhar did not mince words in charging his government of failure to control the all-pervading corruption. ""Far from bringing corruption under control, the government had grossly failed to curb its rise,"" Rajbhar pointed out, while adding, as a matter of fact, the ""rates of illegal money have gone up at all levels, and the worst sufferer is the poor man"". Yogi Adityanath might be using all the resources at his command to drown dissenting notes like that of Rajbhar, but there is no way he can evade answering the issues raised at a juncture when the government was out to blow its trumpet on its first anniversary.    ",2018-03-20,"Om Prakash Rajbhar,UP by-poll results,Law & Order,Yogi Adityanath",What's disturbing Adityanath from celebrating one year in power bash in UP?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/yogi-adityanath-one-year-of-bjp-up-government-ally-om-prakash-rajbhar-obcs-building-temple/story/1/22945.html
470,Javed Anwer,"The skeletons are still tumbling out. It has become clear that Facebook is now one of the biggest threats to the western liberal democracy. This is the message from the latest scandal that the company, along with data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica, finds itself embroiled in. The story is still linked to Russia meddling in the US presidential election that saw Donald Trump racing ahead of Hillary Clinton. But around two years after the talk of this meddling started, the contours of the whole operation are coming into sharper focus. And it is in this big picture we meet Cambridge Analytica. A lot has been said about how Cambridge Analytica worked with the Trump camp to target US voters and how it got data to build psychological profiles of voters from Facebook, so I am going to keep it short. But here is the takeaway: the data that Facebook has on people, and the way this data can be used to build very detailed profiles of people — including their socio-economic conditions, their orientation, their fears, their desires and their political leanings — give companies like Facebook or whoever uses this data an unprecedented leeway. It gives people, companies and organisations that have this data the ability to impact elections in very direct and nefarious ways. The scandal involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica angered regulators and lawmakers in the US and Europe. In the US, senators are leading fresh inquiries into just how much Facebook, which probably knows its users better than the users themselves, is responsible for the US presidential debacle. The regulators in the UK are probing Cambridge Analytica and its role in BREXIT vote, in which against all expectations “leave” triumphed over “remain”. The European regulators are taking a fresh look at whether Facebook violated the EU privacy laws or not by allowing its data to be used by Cambridge Analytica. There are calls to regulate Facebook and streamline its privacy policies. There are calls to force Mark Zuckerberg, one of the most powerful persons in the world right now given how much private data his company has on nearly two billion people, to testify in senate hearings. But even as the rest of the democratic world takes a look at the threat Facebook is posing to the functional democracy, in India there is no talk on this matter. The Election Commission in the world’s biggest – and socially the most complex – democracy is either turning a blind eye to it or is probably woefully ignorant about the ways in which foreign countries can use Facebook to influence elections in India. It’s not unthinkable. Russians allegedly used Facebook to influence the US elections. There are signs that BREXIT too was a vote that was influenced with social media campaigns. In fact, Cambridge Analytica has said on record that it has worked with political parties for elections in India. It reportedly worked with the JDU, with help of its Indian partner Ovlene Business Intelligence in Bihar in 2010 and got a success rate of 90 per cent on the seats for which it provided inputs. Yet, in India, the Election Commission is not looking at how Facebook, or for that matter social media and tools like WhatsApp, can be used by outsiders or by people with dubious aims to influence elections. May be it is already happening. If the presidential election in the US has been influenced by outsiders, what guarantee do we have that some country hasn’t tried to shape elections in India using Facebook or WhatsApp? The process with which voters can be targeted to influence an election unfairly has been made very easy due to all the data collected by Facebook. And the company, so far, has been fairly cavalier about sharing this data. If you are an advertiser, Facebook is mostly more than happy to share even the most private details of its users with you. If you wave money, it will even let you micro-target the voters so that you can influence their franchise. The Election Commission in India is supposed to guard elections from exactly the kind of threat that Facebook poses. There is a reason why exit polls in India have to be made public only after voting has ended. There is a reason why during the campaigning there exists a model code of conduct. There is a reason why politicians can’t say some things in their speeches, or political parties can’t induce people by giving them money on voting day. But using Facebook and WhatsApp, chances are that political parties, or for that matter even actors outside India, can bypass the model code of conduct and break the whole democracy. Facebook data, in a way, can let political parties and organisations play on the fears of the voters, instead of their hopes. It can help politicians reach deep within the minds of voters, using algorithms and big data. In tech parlance, you can say that it can let parties and organisations hack into the minds of voters, and the Cambridge Analytica scandal shows that this can be done by just collecting and analysing the likes and cat videos that people post on Facebook. The Cambridge Analytica scandal is a wake-up call. The lessons from the last US election were alarming, but the latest scandal involving Facebook shows just how badly social media is damaging democracy. It’s time for India — the world’s biggest democracy — to have a conversation about big data, how it influences elections, the micro-targeting of voters and just how much control Facebook should be allowed to have over people’s lives. We need to have this conversation now because in 2019 we will be voting in the general election.",2018-03-20,"General Elections 2019,US Presidential Election,Facebook,Cambridge Analytica","Ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls, why Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal should scare EC",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/cambridge-analytica-facebook-scandal-us-elections-election-commission-general-elections-2019/story/1/22960.html
471,N Jayaram,"Whoever drafted the 1,000-word   - mysteriously dated March 14, but in fact posted on March 16 on behalf of Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah - deserves to be thanked for this important catalyst for a conversation that ought to have begun long ago. Titled ""Regional Identity and Federalism"", the note is also flagged by his official Twitter handle on Friday and can thus be taken as bearing his imprimatur. 
 
 He begins by pointing to the needless hype created by sections of the media, referred to dismissively as “TV studios in Delhi”, last summer over Karnataka’s move to have its own flag. The state government had then set up a committee to study the matter and its report last week recommended a tricolour - yellow, white and red with symbols of India and the state featured on the white  . “The anchors were worried about the unity of India and lectured the Karnataka government on nationalism,” Siddaramaiah recalls and goes on to pose a rhetorical question: “Is the desire of the people of Karnataka to have a flag for their state, to give primacy to Kannada language and to have greater say in the running of their own lives inconsistent with the objective of building a strong nation?” His demarche comes as the state is preparing for Assembly elections in which the BJP is making a strong bid to recapture the power it lost five years ago when its current state leader BS Yeddyurappa had eaten into the party’s votes having floated a breakaway Karnataka Janata Paksha after he had been ousted as chief minister over corruption allegations at the behest of LK Advani. Siddaramaiah’s assertions of his Kannadiga identity, criticism of Hindi-imposition and championing of the state’s rights have put the state BJP in a tight spot, as it fears that opposing his stance and harping on Hindutva nationalism might alienate many voters.  In a few short sentences Siddaramaiah explains how post-Independence India opted for a strong centre but is evolving from a union of states into a federation, having learned “useful lessons from turmoils in Tamil Nadu over Hindi language imposition and demands of autonomy from certain states like Punjab and Assam”. After sketching the history of Kannada and the pride the state takes in it, he gets on to rather slippery ground arguing that better off states such as Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra and Maharashtra give more to the centre in taxes than they get in return. This is a problem common to several large and even medium states with regions and provinces that have modernised and developed at vastly different speeds, be it China, India, Italy or Brazil. Ideally, national governments would want direct and indirect taxes collected from better off regions to be distributed equitably with a view to help the zones lagging behind. Much heart-burning results among the developed - and as they would argue, better-run - regions and in the real world, with corruption and ill-planned development thrown in, the debate gets further heated. “We need a system where states receive larger portion of the taxes collected from our states and the share of centrally sponsored schemes must go down,” the chief minister says, arguing that “the south has been subsidising the north. Six states south of the Vindhyas contribute more taxes and get less.” This is similar to what the leaders of affluent eastern and south-eastern provinces of China would say if they were allowed to and those of northern Italy do say and most vociferously, even raising the threat of  . Southern states have attained stable population growth he says, arguing controversially that as one of the criteria for devolving taxes is population, current policies incentivise states with unchecked growth in numbers. Siddaramaiah is on a more solid ground when he says “states do not have a say in making of the country’s economic policy” and cites the example of cheap pepper being allowed in from Vietnam via Sri Lanka ruining farmers in Kerala and Karnataka. He suggests “a standing mechanism for discussing trade policy and agrarian issues” on the lines of the Goods and Services Tax Council. What was once the Planning Commission turned into NITI Aayog or National Institution for Transforming India by the Narendra Modi government has “effectively dismantled the erstwhile National Development Council (NDC)” with nothing to replace it, he says. “Even the NDC was a talk shop,” Siddaramaiah adds, failing to discuss why his party, the Congress which had been in power at the Centre until 2014, let that come to pass. Karnataka, with a population of 65 million, is bigger than many European countries as are most Indian states, he notes, calling for setting “states free to grow as per their capacity and their genius, without being nervous about any imagined threat from assertion of their identity”. Noting that Indian states post-Independence were organised on linguistic lines, he ends with a flourish: “Many of the languages and cultures of the states pre-date the Indian identity. Yet, we Indians are bound by a common history, common civilisation, and a common destiny. My identity as a proud Kannadiga is not inconsistent with my identity as a proud Indian. So, in Karnataka when we speak about primacy to Kannada, argue against imposition of Hindi language, or call for adoption of a state flag, we are confident we are contributing to building of a strong India; for, a confident Indian nation is confident about the individuality of all her daughters.” That is all well, but how much has Siddaramaiah done to defend the state and its interests as well as against Hindi imposition and for the rights of all the people of the state and not only Kannada speakers? If there is full-blown imposition under the BJP-led government at the Centre now which has all but in name adopted majoritarian Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan nationalism as a policy, the north Indian tongue in whose name several glorious languages such as Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Mythili and others have been eclipsed was being pushed by successive Congress-led administrations too. The Karnataka CM has to account for his party’s complicity in that exercise and state clearly whether it was making a full break now. There need to be federations within the federation and inclusive policies for speakers of minority languages as well as practitioners of minority faiths within states too. In Karnataka, speakers of Beary, Kodava, Konkani, Tamil, Telugu, Tulu, Urdu and other languages need to feel they are not submerged, subsumed and forgotten thanks to Kannada domination. Regions such as Hyderabad-Karnataka or Bombay-Karnataka must have a full say in the running of the state. Hills and forests of Adivasis need to be recogniSed as their ancestral abodes and not subject to destructive, rapacious and environmentally disastrous ""development"", the kind Siddaramaiah’s government has been practising, periodically unveiling ill-advised plans for more roads, railways and other massive encroachments in the already-endangered Western Ghats. The right to life and livelihoods of Dalits and minority communities - which have been under threat and not only since 2014 - must be protected and ensured. Adequate representation of Adivasis, Dalits and minority communities in all echelons of the administration, including in the police and paramilitary forces, might be one of the ways of achieving that. Perhaps the continuing deaths of mostly Dalits engaged in manual scavenging and manhole-cleaning could be prevented if civic bodies and supervisory bodies such as human rights institutions had members of affected castes on their rolls. Would this week’s mass acquittal of Sri Rama Sene goons, including its chief Pramod Muthalik, in the 2009 Mangalore pub attack case have come about if the state policemen, who ought to have filed the evidence that was thick on the ground, were not in the grip of Hindutva forces? Just as the Maharashtra police steeped in Hindutva ideology have made no headway in cracking the assassinations of Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare, so too their Karnataka counterparts have yet to record progress in the killing of rationalist MM Kalburgi. An arrest has been made in connection with Gauri Lankesh’s assassination only recently, more than seven months after the event.  Siddaramaiah and his colleagues in Karnataka have to acknowledge that prominent leaders of their party have evaded justice for their role in the anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984 following Indira Gandhi’s assassination, and that a Congress prime minister looked on as the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992 and thousands of Muslims were killed. Indubitably, these events paved the way for the 2002 anti-Muslim pogrom in Gujarat under a then relatively new state leader, Narendra Modi. That said it is nevertheless good that prominent leaders such as Siddaramaiah in Karnataka and chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu of Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh are now, pushed by ground realities, invoking federalism. A mainstream politician in Tamil Nadu, Vaiko, leader of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, openly condemned   prayer halls in Madurai district early this week. Gauri Lankesh’s sister Kavitha has often spoken in recent months of the groundswell of support she has been getting from not only Karnataka, but swathes of neighbouring states all inviting her to speak at events organised to oppose communalism. These are welcome developments and together should help ensure that the burgeoning Hindutva supremacist menace meets with stout resistance.",2018-03-17,"Congress,BJP,Siddaramaiah,Karnataka Assembly polls",Why Siddaramaiah raised issue of federalism and flag on Facebook post,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-siddaramaiah-facebook-post-karnataka-flag-gst-bjp-congress-assembly-polls/story/1/22899.html

If the BJP does not take its allies in confidence, 2019 could be a tricky road for the saffron party.” He made a very telling observation indicating allies’ loss of confidence in Modi, stating that “BJP comes to power where it is not in power, but retaining their own seats is becoming difficult.” It must cause worry to Narendra Modi because both Naidu and Paswan are the best weathercocks of politics. They have made political opportunism an art of thriving in politics. Naidu and Paswan choose their timings carefully. Modi may not be worried about the BJP’s 2019 electoral prospects in Andhra Pradesh, but he should listen to the alarm bells sounded by Naidu and Paswan. They are unlike BJP’s like-minded ally Shiv Sena, which uses bluster and blackmail as tactics to extract its pound of flesh but continue with the alliance. The TDP and LJP leaders are among the first NDA allies to have begun posturing for 2019 elections. They have correctly read which way is the wind blowing (against Modi). They are among the smartest politicians who are adept at plucking low-hanging political fruits. Paswan is the only politician who has held cabinet positions in all the coalitions since 1996. He was minister in the United Front, NDA and UPA, jumping from the losing combination to winning alliance at the right time. He had resigned from the Vajpayee-led NDA government over Gujarat riots of 2002. When the public mood turned in Modi’s favour on the eve of 2014 elections, Paswan had conveniently forgotten Modi’s record of 2002. Paswan junior hinted at the trouble brewing within the NDA in Bihar when he said that RSLP’s party leader Upendra Kushwaha too was unhappy and might quit the alliance. After Jitan Ram Manji, who joined the RJD-led grand alliance after quitting the NDA, Kushwaha too was likely to leave the NDA, Chirag Paswan claimed. Bihar RJD leaders too have claimed Kushwaha was unhappy within the NDA though the latter contradicted the claim in public. Unlike the Vajpayee government, which faced constant troubles from NDA allies, Modi has had smooth sailing for the last four years. Barring Shiv Sena, most of the allies have kept their grievances within the four corners of the government even as the TDP has been making noises in demand of special category status for Andhra Pradesh. The BJP didn’t have majority of its own during the Vajpayee government, which made it dependent for survival on allies. Now, its absolute majority in the Lok Sabha without NDA allies seems to have tied the hands of allies and smaller parties in expressing their opinion within the government and in public. It’s not that allies have had no complaints. The fact is that Modi’s arrogance and non-consensual political approach have upset the allies, but they have been cautious and restrained against going public. They have been fearful of Modi and BJP president Amit Shah’s reputation for vindictiveness. Modi’s abysmal failure in managing coalitions, his absolute disregard for what Vajpayee might have called observing “coalition dharma” through politics of consensus, have angered NDA partners on various issues. Most of the partners make no secret of their anger in private over Modi’s unilateral decision to have gone for demonetisation. But series of electoral successes, most notably in Uttar Pradesh have, confused NDA partners and made them believe that Modi magic might continue even in 2019. That situation is fast changing in the run-up to the next Lok Sabha elections. After strings of by-election losses in the Hindi belt, especially the humiliating defeat in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur, Phulpur, Bihar’s Araria, Jehanabad and earlier in Rajasthan, NDA allies have become emboldened. The NDA Allies have been deeply concerned about protecting their turfs in their respective states. They feel the time has come to reassess their options for choosing electoral partners for 2019. They can hear and understand the growing rumblings of resentment at the grassroots. They also realise the tide has begun to turn and barring the unlikely possibility of Modi pulling a rabbit out of his hat, his time of reckoning is fast approaching. Paswan was not the only one after Naidu to have expressed concern over of the state of dismal affairs. The Shiv Sena has hit out publicly against Modi stating that by-election loss was a ""defeat of ego and arrogance"". The Sena’s mouthpiece  said, “those who tread the path of lies are destined to lose. The BJP’s tally might go down to 110 in 2019”. Modi’s arrogance is what the allies are speaking out against in private and in public. Even the allies who have declared to stand with BJP - Akali Dal and JD(U) - are disturbed over the treatment meted out to partners. Naidu has charged Modi with trying to play Jaganmohan Reddy’s YSR Congress against the TDP, like the BJP has done in Tamil Nadu. For the allies, who can hear the rumblings on the ground, the time to desert the sinking ship of NDA has arrived.",2018-03-17,"LJP,Allies,TDP exit,BJP",Why NDA allies are revolting against BJP,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/nda-bjp-allies-tdp-exit-ljp-ram-vilas-paswan-chirag-ysr-congress-n-chandrababu-naidu/story/1/22900.html
473,Gautam Benegal,"Heaps of bananas, biscuits, dates and water bottles in cardboard boxes lined the sides of the roads on the night of March 11 to greet more than 35,000 weary farmers who had marched more than 180km to Azad Maidan, Mumbai, to make their demands heard. Even as ordinary Mumbaikars poured out of their homes offering help and succour, and film personalities such Atul Kasbekar, Shirish Kunder, Riteish Deshmukh and Nandita Das tweeted in support, the big stars of Bollywood were conspicuously silent and absent. No Kapoors, Khans and certainly no Big B. The bigger you are the more cautious you have to be, and an industry that is essentially pro-establishment is acutely aware of its vulnerability if it falls foul of the powers that be. 
 
 However, it was not always like this. From the time of Sunil Dutt and Nargis began the trend of going to the border to entertain jawans, stars have raised funds for flood victims, held annual Umang shows for the police to encourage and show solidarity, as well as individually contributed to various social causes. Legendary director Bimal Roy’s son Joy Bimal Roy remembers, “My father belonged to the film world at a time when this unspeakable name 'Bollywood' was not even a blip on the horizon. In those times, the chief minister of Maharashtra, YB Chavan, instituted a fund which was meant specifically to aid the victims of any calamity that befell India. ""The collection drive was spearheaded by the top actors of the day who would move through the city standing atop an open truck exhorting the adoring masses milling around to donate generously for the victims of the earthquake, floods, drought or whatever. They usually managed to mop up quite a tidy sum of money.  ""Contrast this with today's scenario. If there was even a remote possibility of such an occurrence today, the stars would need one truck each to accommodate their entourage, their body guards, the make-up person and hair person to do frequent touch-ups as the whole tamasha is being covered on national network, their spot boy to hold an umbrella overhead lest they faint in the heat, and, of course, their groupies to cheer them on. This is Bollywood. That was Indian cinema. And   the  .” While Joy is pointing out the publicity-driven media optics that decides the nature and extent of a star’s engagement with public affairs, there is another factor to consider. More recently, if not collectively, but individually, Aamir Khan, Shabana Azmi, Rahul Bose and Deepika Padukone, to name a few, have vocally espoused causes and supported a range of issues from the Narmada Bachao Andolan to tsunami relief to AIDS.  But when one goes from causes that are comparatively safe to ones that are politically charged, one is moving into choppy waters. In 2006, during his support to displaced farmers during the Narmada Bachao Andolan, Aamir Khan’s remarks against the Gujarat government and the then chief minister Narendra Modi evoked violent protests in the state. The Gujarat government even decided not to allow the release of his new film  . In a subsequent interview, Aamir said, “I want the people of India to see that here is a political party (BJP) that does not believe in democracy. Here is a party that does not believe in the rights of poor people. I believe in democracy and if I believe in a cause. I will support it. Nobody can tell me to keep quiet.” Aamir had also flayed Modi's Gujarat government over the 2006 violence in Vadodara and had hinted at the Gujarat riots as well without mentioning them specifically. But after the Modi government came to power at the Centre, his meeting with the PM in 2014 resulted in a guarded climb- down from his earlier position and he tweeted saying he was satisfied that he had received assurances that the government would look into “all matters” that were raised in his show  . We have not heard him speak about the Narmada Bachao Andolan ever since.  When he did comment to the media that his wife was thinking about relocating to another country after seeing religious intolerance growing by the day, he was pilloried and name-called on social media.  In journalist Swati Chaturvedi’s book,  , a former BJP IT cell member revealed that Snapdeal was pressurised  to drop the actor as brand ambassador after the saffron party's social media cell turned up the heat on the brand. In November 2015, when Shah Rukh Khan was asked in an NDTV interview to comment on the growing trend of hate crimes in India, especially over religious issues, he said, “It is stupid… It is stupid to be intolerant and this is our biggest issue… Religious intolerance and not being secular in this country is the worst kind of crime that you can do as a patriot.” The interview went viral and caused a huge uproar in which Shah Rukh was labelled an “anti-national.” A call to boycott his subsequent movies was issued, with political parties threatening to destroy any multiplex that would screen them. Ultimately, Khan had to apologise for his comments.  Earlier in February 2010 the Shiv Sena had asked the actor to apologise for a comment which he had made in favour of Pakistani players before unleashing attacks on the film   which was about to be released. Karan Johar apologised on his behalf. In an interview he said, ""I did it because the stakes are very high and I did it because my partners and my distributors have an issue.""  In 2015, Sonam Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha took to Twitter to condemn the meat ban imposed by the Maharashtra government on the occasion of a Jain festival, and interest groups that saw this as an attack on “Hindu” traditions trolled them on social media mocking them that they were bimbos who were paid to look hot and not air their opinion in public. When late actor Om Puri appeared on TV to discuss the ban imposed on Pakistani artistes in India following the Uri attacks, he spoke up in support of the artistes. The jingoist fury unleashed on him by the anchor and the panelists who responded with the clichéd “army standing on the border” trope provoked him more and he burst out, “Who had asked the soldiers to join the Army? Who told them to pick the weapons?” With predictable results. Puri subsequently had to apologise in the most grovelling way. When taking any opposite stance, or critiquing the government brings opprobrium, scorn and hatred down on a star, not just from the party that runs the government, but also from millions of fanatical followers of that party, it is hardly justifiable to expect that star to be a beacon of society’s conscience. The recent Kisan Long March  was organised by the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), the farmers' wing of the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM), along with other farmers’ unions. At the moment, the Communists are the most-hated and despised political entities in India, in fact hardly a force to back if anyone has any sense or regard for his personal safekeeping. The word ""Left"" is treated on a par with ""intellectual"", which is probably considered a worse abuse. The late Om Puri said in 2012, to an outraged public, in the early stages of metamorphosis into the present trolls and bhakts, ""They (Naxals) are not terrorists because they don't resort to irresponsible acts of terror by planting bombs on streets. Naxals are fighters who fight for their rights. They don't harass the common man and the poor."" It was probably the bravest thing a star of his stature could have said at that time. One does not know whether the much reviled hammer and sickle will rise up again in this land with dignity, but it was the common man and the poor of Mumbai who showered flower petals from their balconies and rooftops upon the farmers. It is they who lined the streets and received them with all their hearts. And it is perhaps they who will bring about any social change, or be the custodians of our conscience in the future. Unlike the stars, they have little to lose.    ",2018-03-17,"Farm crisis,Star power,Bollywood,Kisan Long March",Why Bollywood stars like Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan kept shut about farmers marching to Mumbai,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kisan-long-march-nashik-mumbai-bollywood-silence-aamir-shah-rukh-khan-amitabh-bachchan/story/1/22898.html
474,Ashok K Singh,"Nearly a quarter of a century ago, the streets of UP reverberated with a slogan:  (Mulayam and Kanshi Ram coming together has made Sri Ram irrelevant).   Winter had just set in Lucknow, but the political atmosphere was charged up. BJP had suffered a shocking defeat in the 1993 mid-term Assembly elections. Kalyan Singh, heading the BJP’s battle in UP, had been sacked as the chief minister after the demolition of the Babri Mosque in December 1992. BJP too had a slogan  (Ram Lala we will be back, will build the temple there itself). Neither Kalyan Singh nor his boss and mentor in Delhi, LK Advani, had thought Ram Lala’s followers’ march to Ayodhya would be thwarted by “Maulana” Mulayam and Kanshi Ram, who too was riding a wave of Dalit assertion on the back of the slogan, ""T (Brahmin, Baniya and Thakur, thrash them with shoes).  Cut to 2018. Heirs to Mulayam and Kanshi Ram – Ahkilesh and Mayawati – came together, at least for the by-elections to Gorakhpur and Phulpur,  . The  (aunt-nephew) combine managed to stop the Hindutva wave that had swept UP just a year ago in its tracks. Few thought the BJP would lose Gorakhpur, the bastion of Yogi Adityanath, UP chief minister and mahant of the venerable Gorakhnath Peeth. Not many believed Yogi’s deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya would fail to help the party win Phulpur, the Lok Sabha seat he had vacated. But the RSS had other ideas. And the BJP’s top bosses, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, too had  for Yogi. That Modi and Shah didn’t campaign in Gorakhpur and Phulpur despite the national spotlight on the two by-elections, indicates they were keen on maintaining a distance from Yogi. And they wanted to send an unambiguous message to the mahant. Yogi has been walking a tightrope in UP since he took over as the chief minister. He was faced with an unenviable task – on the one hand, of carrying out the RSS agenda, and on the other, keeping a low profile and working as a disciplined soldier of Modi and Shah. Yogi can’t do either. He doesn’t belong to the RSS and can’t submit to the Sangh’s diktats. Modi and Shah would like to control him as they keep other party chief ministers under their thumb. They expect total loyalty. Yogi can’t keep a low profile. He has been a rabble-rouser, who is committed to Hindutva, but in his own way and style. He hasn’t risen from the ranks within the BJP and has been winning the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat on his own steam since 1989. He is a product of the Gorakhnath sect, which has its own following and appeal among a huge band of followers. Yogi has a temperament, an attitude unlike the other handpicked chief ministers of BJP-ruled states, such as ML Khattar of Haryana and Raghubar Das of Jharkhand. Modi and Shah were aware that losses in Lok Sabha seats won in 2014 by the incumbent chief minister and the deputy chief minister would demoralise the party workers and energise the Opposition. But the two couldn’t care less. As a result of his subterranean tensions with the central leadership and the state BJP, Yogi now stands isolated in Lucknow. His government is in disarray. There is visible lack of co-ordination between the chief minister and BJP workers. The state party chief Mahendra Nath Pandey and general secretary Sunil Bansal have been working at cross-purposes with the CM. Then there is the RSS factor. A team of senior RSS leaders led by joint general secretary Dattatreya Hosbole recently visited Lucknow to take stock of the ground situation in UP in the run-up to the 2019 elections. The RSS had been aware of the disarray setting in Lucknow. The meeting was held at the chief minister’s residence. Yogi and Maurya represented the government, and the meeting was attended by state BJP president and senior party leaders Pandey and Sunil Bansal, along with other important RSS leaders. Hosbole, considered close to Modi, is reported to have voiced his dissatisfaction over several issues. He didn’t mince words and expressed his displeasure over complaints of corruption and the performance of the bureaucracy. The RSS leaders were upset that the benefits of the government schemes were not reaching the poor and downtrodden, Dalits and other sections of the society which had given the BJP an unprecedented mandate.  Hosbole asked Yogi to control the bureaucracy, which he felt had become unbridled. He also asked Yogi and Maurya to bury their differences and ensure better co-ordination in the running of the government. The bureaucracy under the Yogi government is like a headless chicken. The chief minister doesn’t have control over senior officers, who know that Yogi and Modi do not see eye to eye on many issues. The bureaucracy is also taking advantage of the differences between Yogi and Maurya, the lack of co-ordination between the party and the government, and the communication gap between Yogi and the central leadership. Hosbole is reported to have warned Yogi and other key people in the party and the government to pull up their socks for the 2019 elections. Did Modi, Shah and RSS want to cut Yogi to size and send a message to him to fall in line? Did Modi deliberately keep away from campaigning in Gorakhpur?  Whatever may be the truth, the perception in Lucknow is that the BJP government under Yogi is a divided house, with the prime minister and the chief minister not on the same page.  ",2018-03-15,"Narendra Modi,Yogi Adityanath,Phulpur,Gorakhpur","UP by-polls results show all is not well between Modi, Amit Shah  and Adityanath",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uttar-pradesh-by-polls-gorakhpur-phulpur-yogi-adityanath-narendra-modi-rss-bjp/story/1/22867.html
475,Asit Jolly,"Speaking at the World Punjabi Conference in Chandigarh, Punjab’s finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who is widely known and even admired for his speeches laced with Urdu couplets, provoked quite a storm when he questioned the English language proficiency of the state’s civil bureaucracy. Assuring delegates at the conference that all official work in the state government was being conducted in Punjabi, Badal, however, lamented the fact that barring a few, most civil servants can’t even draft a letter in English properly. “Ashamed” is what the minister says he feels when drafts of important memoranda that had to be sent to the central government are put before him for perusal. He wondered (aloud) how any of the officers had managed to clear the civil services examination. The finance minister’s words predictably touched some very raw nerves within Punjab’s IAS fraternity. And although none of the serving civil servants have spoken publicly, there’s reportedly been a furious exchange of WhatsApp messages criticising Badal for his uncharacteristic ""lack of decorum"". Several posts, in turn, accused the minister of employing impossible-to-understand Urdu verse, often, even for official work. “We cannot understand what he (Manpreet Badal) is saying, most of the time,” was one such peeved remark on WhatsApp. Karan Bir Singh Sidhu, president of the Punjab IAS Officers’ Association, refused to offer a comment pointing out that “everyone in the country has the right to free speech (even the finance minister),” Another functionary of the association, who requested anonymity, disclosed that the IAS fraternity viewed Badal’s remarks as “insulting,” and was pressing for an official response. While the ""still in service"" (read that as vulnerable) babus either maintained silence or employed the relative anonymity of social networks, retired senior bureaucrats, unfettered by the restrictions of office, have sprung to the rescue of their younger ex-colleagues. Rajan Kashyap, a former chief secretary and one of the few bureaucrats with a master’s degree in English literature, says he disagrees with Badal, insisting, ""officers in Punjab are well-versed in both English and Punjabi"". Subodh Agarwal, also a former chief secretary, who is not particularly known to confront political bosses, said, “English isn’t the only thing.” He pointed out that unlike in the past when most coming into the IAS were from humanities or literature background, the present crop includes engineers and doctors who bring a whole host of other skills to the service. But while former civil servants were measured in their response and criticism, Opposition politicians weren’t as forgiving. The leader of the Opposition and Aam Admi Party spokesperson Sukhpal Singh Khaira, while describing the state of affairs narrated by the minister as “unfortunate,” dared the incumbent government to initiate action against officers for poor English skills. The finance minister’s cousin and former deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal pointed to Manpreet Badal’s enduring fondness for Urdu to suggest that perhaps it was his cousin who lacks proficiency and couldn’t make sense of the officialese. An alumnus of St Stephen’s College, and a law graduate from the University of London, finance minister Manpreet Badal, however, hasn’t opted to engage any further.

476,Sagarneel Sinha,"UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi   on Tuesday, March 13, where leaders of 19 Opposition parties hobnobbed together. Opposition parties including SP, BSP, Trinamool Congress, CPM, CPI, NCP, RJD, JMM, NC, DMK, JD(S), AIUDF, JVM, RLD, BTP, HAM, RSP, Kerala Congress and IUML marked their presence. Out of the 20 Opposition parties, DMK, BSP, RLD, HAM, BTP and JVM don't have any representatives in the Lok Sabha. The other 14 parties together have 71 Lok Sabha MPs, add to this, 48 MPs from the Congress and the tally goes up to 119. Prominent leaders who attended the dinner include NCP's Sharad Pawar, SP's Ram Gopal Yadav, CPI's D Raja, BSP's Satish Mishra, Trinamool's Sudip Bannerjee, NC's Omar Abdullah, DMK's Kanimozhi, CPM's Mohammad Salim, RJD's Tejashvi Yadav, and BTP's Sharad Yadav. Congress president Rahul Gandhi, former prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh and other key Congress leaders such as Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge and Ghulam Nabi Azad also attended the dinner. Sonia Gandhi is actually trying to test the political waters ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections with dinner diplomacy, though the Congress tried to show it as a ""sign of amity and friendship"". Though she resigned from the presidentship of the grand old party in 2017, handing over the reins to her son Rahul Gandhi, Mrs Gandhi continues to be the face of the party for the Opposition. Congress is aware of the party's shrinking base which is no more in a position to win 160-170 seats. To defeat the dominant BJP led by its invincible leader Narendra Modi, the Congress needs to unite the Opposition parties around the country, which is a Herculean task. But the problem is that most Opposition parties hesitate to rally under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. That's why Sonia had to resurface in the political arena despite her unwillingness to play an active role in politics, given her health issues. It was Sonia's alliance strategy that worked for the party in 2004 and then in 2009. However, the situation today is no longer what it was in 2004. BJP then wasn't as powerful as it is in its current avatar, ruling 20 states across the country. The party has been successful in becoming a pan-India party by beating the Congress which currently is in power in only three states - Karnataka, Punjab and Mizoram along with a Union territory, Puducherry. Northeast once considered a bastion of the Congress has turned saffron except Mizoram, the state which goes to election later this year. The situation is very critical for the Congress party, as it is losing all its strongholds one after another. Though the Congress remains the largest Opposition party, there have been challenges from leaders like NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who has ambitions of leading the Opposition. There are reports that Pawar  in the last week of March. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is expected to be present at the meet though she was conspicuous by her absence from Sonia's dinner party. Sonia knows that Pawar is a clever and astute political player, who has friends across the political spectrum. Also, Telangana chief minister and TRS chief Chandrasekhar Rao's third front initiatives are getting louder with support pouring in from regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee, Shiv Sena's Uddhav Thackeray and DMK's MK Stalin. This should worry the Congress. Pawar, KCR or Mamata flexing their muscles is not a good sign for the grand old party headed by its new president Rahul Gandhi, who has drawn criticism from several quarters for his political immaturity. The most recent example was his ill-timed visit to Italy, knowing the fact that the mandate in Meghalaya would be fractured. Despite the Congress being the largest party with 21 seats in the new Assembly, BJP with only 2 seats in its kitty walked away with the state by integrating the regional parties into the fold of NDA. By the time Rahul came back to India, the bastion of Meghalaya had turned saffron and he was left only with the option of blaming BJP for using money power to usurp the state from its hold.Some of the parties that attended Sonia's dinner party are bitter rivals in their home states. The Left and Trinamool Congress, for instance, are at loggerheads in West Bengal. Also, the Congress itself is locked in a direct fight with the Left in Kerala. Though the cold relations between the two bitter rivals, SP and BSP, have started to thaw, it couldn't be a foregone conclusion given Mayawati's unpredictable nature, especially in alliances. Already, BSP, along with Pawar's NCP, has allied with the JD(S) in Karnataka, the only large Congress-ruled state, where the alliance is expected to eat into the Congress votes only to help the BJP. JD(S) chief Gowda himself was present at the dinner, yet the party hasn't disclosed its intentions with regard to a post-poll alliance in the state, if a such situation arises. Former PM Gowda has formed alliances in the past with both the Congress and the BJP. He recently spoke about ""burning his fingers"" in the past due to an alliance with the Congress. Parties such as NCP and JD(S) are keeping their options open. BJP is also trying to develop good relations with the DMK. PM Modi's recent veiled overtures to former Tripura chief minister, Manik Sarkar, also indicate that the party is trying to woo Sarkar, an anti-Congress CPM leader to keep up the opposition against party general secretary Sitaram Yechury, who favours a tie-up with Congress. In order to continue its victory march in this year's Assembly elections and the coming general elections, BJP wants to ensure that other parties do not rally behind the Congress and the grand old party stays divided. Absence of prominent parties such as Andhra Pradesh's ruling party TDP and the main opposition YSR Congress, Telangana's ruling party TRS and Odisha's ruling party BJD clearly points that the Congress has failed to accommodate the prominent parties of these three states which together account for 46 Lok Sabha seats. The upcoming Karnataka elections, where the Congress will fight the BJP to retain the state, are very crucial. If the grand old party fails in Karnataka, it would add a more negative grade to the already beleaguered party and help raise the stature of regional leaders such as Sharad Pawar, KCR and Mamata Banerjee.

477,Minhaz Merchant,"A sense of entitlement afflicts Indian politicians. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi is a victim. So is her son Congress president Rahul Gandhi. So are Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. At the   last week, Sonia declared: ""We will not let them (BJP) come back to power in 2019"", as if proclaiming a royal decree. In Singapore, around the same time, Rahul engaged in a verbal kerfuffle with author . The Congress president’s body language, sipping water, legs crossed, as professor Basu repeated his question, radiated arrogance bred by an overweening sense of entitlement. Modi tries to be humble most of the time, but his hubris occasionally shows. For example, it was thoughtless to not take Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu’s phone call for 16 hours even after two TDP ministers had resigned from the Union cabinet or at a function to walk past senior BJP leader and mentor-turned-critic LK Advani without acknowledging him. Advani’s anguished expression said it all.  Amit Shah does not even try to hide his hubris. This story may be apocryphal but when the BJP’s then political strategist  asked him following the party’s stunning victory in the May 2014 Lok Sabha election, “what after May”, Shah reportedly replied, “June”. Kishore left the BJP, but after unsuccessful stints with the Congress and the SP may return to the BJP fold ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. With the four main protagonists - Sonia, Rahul, Modi and Shah - suffused with hubris, the election campaign for 2019 will be long and brutal. But make no mistake: the first dose of venom that has poisoned Indian political discourse was injected by Sonia in 2007 with her ""maut ka saudagar"" taunt. To call a sitting chief minister the “merchant of death” opened the floodgates to political abuse. It was soon the new normal. Just as it pioneered feudal dynastic politics (now embraced by every regional party), the Congress pioneered invective in India’s political lexicon. Sonia was also the first politician in the Congress to shrewdly recognise in 2007 the threat Narendra Modi posed. Modi was then a relatively unknown chief minister. But Sonia saw in him 11 years ago some of the same qualities she herself possessed: ruthlessness, cunning, decisiveness. Congress leaders are better at lacing abuse with mordant humour. BJP leaders, hopelessly inarticulate, abuse without the benefit of clever nuance. In this ""BJP Bharat versus Congress India"" linguistic battle, India wins. The Congress can taunt the prime minister and pretend it is banter. The leaden-footed BJP responds with rage, bereft of ameliorative cadence. BJP’s Assam leader Himanta Biswas Sarma last week called Rahul Gandhi a “feudal lord”. For someone as steeped in privilege as Rahul, that’s not an insult. In India being a feudal lord is not, for feudal lords, a bad thing. Sarma’s choice of words reflects the unequal battle between the Congress’ India and the BJP’s Bharat. The Congress takes its feudalism for granted. It isn’t embarrassed - though of course it should be - that one family has usurped a 133-year-old party. Feudalism breeds both arrogance and ignorance. It is this hubris which allows Sonia to say artlessly that she can envisage a future Congress with a non-Gandhi president. But as she knows perfectly well, since its founding in 1885 the Congress has had 60 presidents; 54 of them were not Nehru-Gandhis. The six who were: Motilal Nehru, Jawahalal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and now Rahul Gandhi. Sonia holds the dubious distinction of being Congress president for 20 years - the longest in the party’s history, longer than Mahatma Gandhi (one year), Jawaharlal Nehru (eight years), Vallabhbhai Patel (one year), K Kamaraj (four years), Sarojini Naidu (one year) and Jagjivan Ram (two years). How is the “idea of India” different from the “idea of Bharat”? The BJP’s Bharat has a chip on its shoulder. Culture minister  , which in itself is harmless enough, but an anachronism when it is the future that interests India’s young. The Congress’ India in contrast is a colonial construct: feudal, entitled and presumptuous. It is long past its sell-by date. As I wrote in  (January 18, 2013), “In 1947, Mahatma Gandhi, freedom achieved, wanted to disband the Congress and form new political organisations to contest free elections. Sardar Vallabbhai Patel agreed. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru did not. Nehru’s view prevailed. In 1969, Indira Gandhi split the Congress to sideline the syndicate of regional satraps led by K Kamaraj and S Nijalingappa. The organisational and state-level decline of the Congress began in 1969 though Mrs Gandhi’s 1971 election victory and the euphoria over the Bangladesh war disguised it for years. “Nehru inherited a colonial administration. After Independence, it continued to serve the government in power. Colonial laws had been written to often protect British injustice, not deliver justice to Indians. Many remain cast in stone 150 years later, delaying and denying justice to ordinary Indians. Yet, Nehru did not impose chief ministers on states. The party’s local organisation was given a relatively free hand to choose regional leaders. Indira Gandhi reversed that policy. She imposed state chief ministers, suspended intra-Congress elections, dismissed opposition state governments under Article 356, and undermined the judiciary.” If the Congress wants to re-establish its connect with Bharat’s electorate, it will need to shed not only its feudal skin but make Sonia Gandhi’s declaration come true: a future Congress without a Gandhi as either party president or prime minister. The last time that happened in recent decades was in 1992-1996 when PV Narasimha Rao was both prime minister and Congress president. The Rao-led economic reforms transformed India. His was the new Congress that could have created a new India.

478,Ananth Krishnan,"As we lined up at Tiananmen Square on a smoggy Beijing winter afternoon this Sunday, there was a sense among the few hundred journalists from China and abroad that we were about to witness something momentous. This was in itself unusual. The annual March gathering of China’s parliament — the Communist Party of China (CPC)-approved National People’s Congress (NPC) — is rarely ever the scene of any excitement. For two weeks, CPC-selected lawmakers sing paeans to the party. There is no real debate or dissent. Covering the event, needless to say, hardly sets the pulse racing. On Sunday, however, China was about to take a major step that could potentially change the course of both its history and relations with the world. Two weeks before the NPC convened, the CPC announced it had proposed an amendment to the Constitution ending a two term limit for the president, paving the way for President Xi Jinping to enjoy an extended tenure at the helm. Xi took over as general secretary of the CPC and chair of the Central Military Commission of the People’s Liberation Army in 2012, and as President in March 2013. His first two posts are the main source of his power, and the presidential position has been mainly relevant in representing China internationally. His party and PLA posts do not have term limits, but because of the 10 year presidential limit that was introduced by then leader Deng Xiaoping in 1982 to prevent the rise of another Mao, Xi’s two predecessors Jiang Zemin and Huy Jintao gave up all three posts after two five-year terms. This unique system distinguished China from other autocracies by institutionalising “collective leadership” and not allowing one man (there are few women at the top of the CPC) to hold all power. But this amendment would end all that, overturning a 36-year rule. Xi walked in to the stage at the massive Great Hall of the People looking assured, and as the 2,963 present lawmakers cast their ballot, the journalists were made to temporarily leave the hall. Ten minutes later, we were called in. On a blue screen, the result flashed: of 2,963 present lawmakers, 2,958 supported the change, with two opposing and three abstaining. The deed was done, and Xi has now ensured complete and indefinite control of China’s three key institutions — for as long as he wishes.

479,Sreejith Panickar,"Indian politics is a lot dynamic and fun to watch. You celebrate a massive victory one day, and suffer a humiliating loss the following day. BJP can explain it best in the present — climbing down from the blessings of Tripura Sundari ten days ago, to perhaps the wrath of Shri Ram today. More than just by-polls results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the news from UP puts forth some serious possibilities for the principal Opposition parties for the near future. The results stress the fact further that BJP can be challenged in the 2019 general elections only if there is a combine of other parties, especially regional parties. But when they form it, they would be killing their own founding/practising ideologies each other for existence — like AAP shaking hands with the Congress, and the BSP doing that with the SP, their principal opponents. CPM, whose ideologies differ from most others’, will have no option either. Because of this very reason of conflicting ideologies and priorities, the alliance will be like a building with a large umbrella as a ceiling, instead of a solid roof and can break apart any moment. Even if they achieve to enter into a possible alliance, to what extent the regional parties cooperate with each other is debatable. For instance, there’s still no alliance, but only an agreement between SP and BSP. There could be an ego of supremacy when they form an alliance at the national level, as to who is bigger. For instance, Mayawati may not unconditionally accede to the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav. But to save themselves from the possibility of annihilation at the hands of BJP, they may well have to reach consensus on seat sharing and leadership. They should be quick to realise that it is better to have something than nothing. Akhilesh Yadav, with the support of BSP can emerge as the leader of such a political formation, considering the number of seats UP represents in the Lok Sabha. Congress is soon becoming a no-entity in such equations, and they better be part of such an alliance. What holds against Akhilesh Yadav is that he is still largely only a regional leader, and not a prominent figure at the national level. But Rahul Gandhi isn’t that popular either across the country, despite leading a national party. Akhilesh is perhaps more qualified to stand opposite Narendra Modi, although a largely regional face may not come out as a prime ministerial candidate, prior to the elections. What is even more important is to strategise an alliance at the earliest and create a common minimum programme that caters to all segments of the country. The results do send out several warning signs to the “invincible” BJP leadership. The party has become very complacent as it has started enjoying the cosiness of power and overwhelming mandate. An example of it is the low turnout in the by-polls. Complacency is what killed the Congress too. If Manik Sarkar can lose Tripura, and if BJP can lose Gorakhpur, pretty much anything can happen in any constituency.",2018-03-14,"BJP,Narendra Modi,2019 Lok Sabha polls,UP by-poll results",UP by-polls results signal a message to Opposition parties,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/up-2019-lok-sabha-polls-narendra-modi-bjp-gorakhpur-congress-sp/story/1/22841.html
480,Madhuri Danthala,"Soon, images of the blistered feet and dehydrated farmers, circulating on social media, will be pushed into the oblivion of our collective conscience. Unlike the farmers from Tamil Nadu who failed to get an audience with the prime minister, and the farmers of Madhya Pradesh who were met with bullets, the farmers of Maharashtra were successful in getting the government to blink. With a written assurance given by the government, the protesting farmers called off their stir. 
 
The assurance of the Maharashtra government, however, cannot be construed as an act of magnanimity, even though the supporters of the ruling party want us to believe so. If the Maharashtra government was indeed serious about addressing the grievances of the farmers, it would have sent an emissary to deliberate with them rather than wait for the farmers’ long march, which started on March 6 to culminate in Mumbai after walking 180km in the debilitating heat. The government, if it was really sensitive, would have acted when farmers emptied containers of milk and dumped vegetables on the roads in protest last year.  
 
 Despite capturing the attention of the mainstream and social media, albeit after a few days, the urban folks still don’t seem to understand the magnitude of the agrarian crisis. People still rued that loan waivers was bad economics while others continued to suspect the march, ridiculously terming it a hidden agendum of the ""urban naxalites"". Most people also failed to realise that waiving off loans is only a respite and not the solution to the agrarian crisis. Further, waiving off loans wasn’t the only demand of the protesting farmers. The farmers, among other things, also demanded that the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan Committee appointed by the UPA government be implemented, which envisions a system for food and nutrition security, sustainability in farming, and enhancing the quality and cost competitiveness of farm commodities. The tragedy of the Indian media and middle classes is that our awareness of the agrarian crisis is close to zilch. The news channels seldom attempt to educate citizens about the causes that trigger and sustain the crisis of the Indian agricultural sector. Common citizens seldom deliberate about the lack of credit facilities for the farmers which makes them dependent on money lenders for loans at high interests. This increases the input costs and with a low procurement price (the price at which state governments purchase the produce from farmers), it makes farming an unfeasible activity. With infrastructural bottlenecks, changing climate and a myopic government, the future looks bleak. Yet, given how the Maharashtra government responded to the farmers’ march, the best way to compel our governments to act is when as responsible citizens we deliberate upon the crisis and ruminate over the solutions in large numbers on social media, rather than indulging in meaningless whataboutery. It is our collective ignorance and intellectual lassitude which gives room for governments to be inhumanely insensitive. For instance, it was recently reported that to coincide with the inauguration of the Sardar Sarovar Dam on September 17, 2017, (a few weeks ahead of the Assembly elections in Gujarat), the Madhya Pradesh government released an unusually high amount of water so that the reservoir looks full when the PM inaugurates it. Even as the concerned authorities state that it was a mere coincidence, the priorities of the government is under cloud. With half of India’s farms still dependent on rainfall due to a paucity of irrigation facilities, such recklessness is dangerously myopic on behalf of the government. One of the main causes of the agrarian crisis is the non-availability of cultivable land. The land-man ratio is less than 0.2 hectares of cultivable land per head of the rural population. The MS Swaminathan Committee recommends that ceiling-surplus and waste lands be distributed to address this anomaly. Thus, instead of being smitten by bullet trains and hyper-loops, urban India must realise that it is in our national interest to address the acute and chronic agrarian crisis. Neither the uppity of the nouveau riche, nor the vile of the internet trolls can feed us three times a day. The more we ignore the agrarian crisis as a rural problem, that has nothing to do with us, the more culpable we become in destroying our growth prospects and jeopardising our future.  ",2018-03-13,"Devendra Fadnavis,Maharashtra,Farm loan waiver,Farm crisis",Why it took thousands of bleeding feet to walk 180km to make Indians wake up to farm crisis,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/farm-crisis-loan-waiver-land-rights-forests-urban-naxalites-maharashtra-devendra-fadnavis-bjp-trolls/story/1/22807.html
481,Kamal Mitra Chenoy,"The 180km-long march of thousand of farmers from Nashik to Mumbai has led to a slew of promises by the  . Mumbaikars felt indebted to the farmers, led by the All India Kisan Sabha and other farmer groups, particularly for their decision not to take to the streets in the morning, but instead march to Azad Maidan at night, keeping in mind the Class 10 board exam. But the promises made to the farmers are - as professor MS Swaminathan, chairman  of the recommendations of the National Commission on Farmers that is commonly referred to as the Swaminathan panel,   - temporary or ad hoc solutions. Professor Swaminathan has clearly stated that, “The demand for loan waiver is indicative of non-viability of farm economics. Every step should be taken to make farming economically viable.” 
 
 As he bluntly put it, “I am sorry to say that very simple and short-term strategies like loan waiver are adopted... loan waiver is only an easy way to get a new farm loan. But writing off does not guarantee repayment of the next loan unless farming is made viable.” He went on to stress that ""apart from writing off loans, the focus should be to ensure how the loan is repaid. For this, farming economics needs to be fixed... We need a new agriculture, based on ecology and economics"". This general prescription though important, raises critical issues. P Sainath, who has written extensively on agriculture in Maharashtra, has in his detailed writings shown the severe impact on farmers taking loans in distressed times, where rural banking loans are inadequate or take inordinate time to be serviced. This forces many farmers to go to moneylenders who charge exorbitant interest and are ruthless in demanding quick repayment of the loans with interest. Agricultural outreach is insufficient, in terms of roads, wells, drinking water, affordable fertilisers, cheap access to seeds, and other examples of agricultural extension. Land-use planning is also critical. Prof Swaminathan pointed out that farmers often end up sowing more than the demand. This leads to price crash of their produce. There is a bitter irony there. One of the most important issues in poverty reduction is the need for cheap and accessible farm products. But in a skewed market, there are plenty of farm products available, but not affordable for the land-owning farmers, and highly inadequate food for the poor farmers and landless peasants. So in the farming sector, landless farmer must get adequate access to affordable funds, fertilisers, seeds, latest farm technologies and water. Later, technologies like cold storages, where farm products are stored, must be introduced so that vegetables, fruits, etc, can be purchased by farmers at reasonable prices. These are long-term, and not short-term solutions. As professor Swaminathan has repeatedly pointed out, farmers of different produce have suffered over the years more for the excess acreage of their crops, than the demand for their produce. The landless peasants must be supported by the workers, land and water activists, agricultural experts, environmental activists to raise the living standards in the agrarian sector. Short-term measures will only be popular in the short-term. But medium- and long-term measures are urgently required for the farmers who with their blood, sweat and tears are able to strike a balance between ecology and economics, as professor Swaminathan has urged.  ",2018-03-13,"Devendra Fadnavis,Maharashtra,Farm loan waiver,Farm crisis",Why the farmer crisis is far from over,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/farmers-kisan-long-march-farm-crisis-loan-waiver-ad-hoc-solution-devendra-fadnavis-bjp/story/1/22812.html
482,Panini Anand,"Jawaharlal Nehru spent his political life with a rose in his buttonhole. Atal Bihari Vajpayee took the lotus to mean everything for him. LK Advani, despite all the setbacks and humiliations, has neither been able to give up the lotus, nor has the neglected, sidelined Shahnawaz Hussain. But not all politicians have such limitations. There are others who choose not a solitary bloom, but a whole bouquet of parties and ideologies. They pick whichever flower takes their fancy, whenever. One such versatile leader is the soon-to-be BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh,  . Agrawal, once he found his road to Parliament from the Samajwadi Party blocked, promptly stomped out and joined the BJP. However, this is not the first time Agarwal has changed party colours. The ""Ram Vilas Paswan of Uttar Pradesh"", he switches parties before a decade passes. His road to the BJP orginated from the Congress, the Loktantrik Congress, the BSP and then the SP. So will Agarwal’s defection come as a major blow to the party? At first glance, it may seem so, as with Agarwal’s exit go the hopes of the SP sending the BSP’s candidate to the Rajya Sabha. But in the long run, it is not the SP, but the BJP who is going to be harmed by Agarwal. Agarwal began his stint in the BJP with a sexist comment against Jaya Bachchan, saying the SP preferred “someone who danced in films” over him as the Rajya Sabha candidate. The remark led to protests within the BJP, with Sushma Swaraj, Smriti Irani and Rupa Ganguly slamming Agarwal. The second factor is that for the past many years, the BJP cadre in Hardoi have been fighting against Agarwal. Now, they will be forced to work for him. This will certainly not go down well with the ground-level workers. While this may seem a minor trouble to the BJP leadership at present, a cadre-based party can ill-afford to miff its workers. The Samajwadi Party workers and top brass, on the other hand, must be celebrating Agarwal’s quitting as good riddance. It is true that the party cadre is unlikely to be happy over the selection of Jaya Bachchan as the Rajya Sabha candidate. The decision has come in for criticism even outside the party. But no one, apart from maybe Ram Gopal Yadav, is likely to mourn Agarwal’s departure, and for good reasons. The first reason is that Agarwal was by no means a vote-fetcher for the SP. Apart from his seat and his influence in Hardoi, he had nothing to offer the party. Agarwal’s caste has traditionally been a BJP votebank, and hardly ever chooses the SP. Thus, Agarwal joining the BJP is a zero loss situation for the SP. Nor is Agarwal likely to hike the BJP’s vote tally, because that votebank is already in the party’s kitty. Moreover, as Agarwal stands for no ideology, he does not have dedicated voters of his own. All he has had is the voterbase of whichever party he has been associated with. Secondly, with Agarwal’s exit, Akhilesh Yadav has sent out a message to Ram Gopal Yadav and his group that he won’t let anyone else dominate over the party. It is also an invitation to those who had been sidelined due to Agarwal, and who had a problem with his status and influence within the party. At least these people will now look at Akhilesh in a more positive light. There is, however, one loss to the SP. Without Agarwal, the party will have no one to speak up for it with a powerful voice in the Rajya Sabha. In the past few years, Agarwal had emerged as an efficient and influential parliamentarian. He was among the prominent Opposition voices, who debated well with cogent points. Thus, a strong voice that spoke for the SP in Parliament will now be speaking against it. But for Akhilesh Yadav’s party, fighting the BJP in the electoral battlefield and hiking up its vote tally is a bigger challenge than visibility in the Rajya Sabha. Also, Jaya Bachchan will pose no headache for Akhilesh in the Rajya Sabha, and will do as he wants her to. Agarwal, on the other hand, can prove to be an actual risk for the BJP, in two ways. First is that the party cadre will not be able to accept Agarwal easily. The cadre has been working for leaders like Vinay Katiyar, who has been sidelined to elevate Agarwal. The grassroots workers are unlikely to be enthused by this. The party will be repeatedly embarrassed by the anti-BJP and other controversial statements that Agarwal has made in the past, and is likely to keep making. Moreover, no one can say how long he will stay with the BJP. Once he quits, it will come as another blow to the morale of the BJP and RSS cadre in Hardoi. On his part, Agarwal seems to have forgotten the lot of others who have defected to the BJP before him. Jitan Ram Manjhi, Swami Prasad Maurya, Ram Achal Rajbhar, far too many leaders were brought into the BJP with much alacrity and fanfare, and as quickly consigned to the margins. This new relationship, thus, seems likely to benefit neither Agarwal nor the BJP.

483,Angellica Aribam,"When China created headlines globally with the news of the Communist Party of China's (CPC) proposal to end the existing presidential terms a fortnight ago, the news was hardly a surprise to political trend watchers, it was just a question of when. The seeds of this eventual constitutional amendment were sowed in the 19th Party Congress, convened once every five years, held in October 2017 when   didn't anoint a successor despite entering his second/final term in office. For months leading up to the Party Congress, speculations were rife on who would be nominated as the next leader of the party by the nearly 3,000 delegates gathered in Beijing for a week-long deliberation session. When the names for the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee - the highest decision-making body of the CPC - were declared, it became evident that Xi would stay on for much longer as all the men in the committee weren't young enough to lead the country post 2022. It was noteworthy that Xi's name made way into the Constitution, an honour earlier held only by two leaders - Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Since time immemorial, every time   undergoes the daunting task of having to decide on a successor, it leads to chaos. It won't be an exaggeration to say that succession has been one of the main themes of internal conflict in Chinese politics. The Republic of China was formed in the aftermath of the collapse of the Qing dynasty, becoming the first republic in Asia, in 1912. The prevailing idea of succession from then till the end of Mao Zedong days was ""to serve the people until death"" on the same lines as that of monarchy. The People's Republic of China came to being on October 1, 1949, with the CPC consolidating all political power. Even then, the question of succession remained a major political issue blowing out of proportion from time to time. Mao, during his lifetime, chose two successors, both of whom died under unnatural circumstances, without ever making it to the top. After Mao's demise, China saw a huge succession crisis followed by a coup d'etat. In the following years, Deng Xiaoping also faced a similar succession crisis. Both his chosen successors had to be removed from their positions. However, Deng Xiaoping, aware of the damages caused by succession conflicts, amended the Constitution in 1982 with major reforms and also created a new system called the Gedai Zhiding. In this unique process, the current leader, instead of choosing his immediate successor, anoints his successor's successor. This was done to remove the dominance of the existing leader, and to allow the anointed successor to govern without fear of conflict or allegiance hampering his actions. Adhering to this convention, Deng Xiaoping who could have been in office till whenever he desired, didn't do so but handed over the reins to future leaders. Similarly, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao exited office right at the end of their two terms. Since his coming to power in 2012, Xi Jinping has been on a mission to reform the party and the country, or in plain terms to establish the supremacy of the party over the state. Though it is contrary to the amendments brought in by Deng Xiaoping in which he wanted to clearly demarcate powers between the party and the state in the aftermath of the chaos caused by the Cultural Revolution from 1966-1976. Decades later, Xi Jinping has been going on with an objective to make the party stronger. With the massive anti-corruption campaigns, he has been portraying himself as a visionary leader who is purging the party of self-serving politicians. Many political leaders have been expelled from the party and public offices. In the 18th Party Congress held in 2012, Hu Jintao named two leaders namely Hu Chunhua and Sun Zhengcai to lead China as President and Premier respectively after Xi Jinping's tenure ends in 2022. However, Sun was charged with corruption late last year and has been expelled from the party. Hu was replaced from his position as the head of the party's Guangdong region by Xi Jinping's protege, Li Xi, a couple of months ago. The proposal to amend the Constitution was passed by the National People's Congress, the rubber stamp Parliament, on March 11. In the last two weeks, all political discussions within China revolved around this new development and it was divided into two major factions. On the one side, there were those who were drawing parallels between Mao and Xi, fearing China becoming a totalitarian state from its status quo of authoritarianism. Some were even comparing Xi's anti-corruption drive to the infamous Cultural Revolution of the 1960s which served as a platform for Mao to get rid of his political adversaries and drove the country into a state of complete disarray for more than a decade. Due to massive social media discussions, certain phrases critical or satirical towards Xi and his new bid were banned from the internet. On the other side, there were those who believe that Xi's extended governance would provide a consistent leadership push to the vision and reform agenda which he has been working on for the last five years. Many were also of the opinion that to get China out of the middle income trap, it needs long-term policies provided by long-term rule which would be addressed easily with this new amendment coupled with the administration of one of China's strongest leaders, second only to Mao. With the official declaration today, it has indeed become an interesting period in the history of Chinese politics, but only time which would ascertain which faction was more accurate, for politics hardly ever is black and white.",2018-03-12,"Hu Jintao,Mao Zedong,Chinese President,Xi Jinping",Why China has allowed Xi Jinping to remain President for life,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/xi-jinping-chinese-president-mao-zedong-hu-jintao-communist-party-of-china/story/1/22778.html
484,Manoj Joshi,"The French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit has been an opportunity for India to signal its intention of restoring a balanced posture to its foreign policy, with a stress on regional security and multi-polarity. Since France sees itself as an autonomous global player, New Delhi has chosen to emphasise this by striking agreements with Paris that mirror its arrangements with the US. The reciprocal logistics support agreement and the agreement to protect classified information are similar to those arrived at with the US after long negotiations. The Joint Strategic Vision for Cooperation in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is much like the document agreed to with the US during the Obama visit in 2015. Though the Indo-American agreement emphasises Pacific issues, the Indo-French one focuses on the IOR which is probably more practical. Looked at any way, the outcome of the Macron visit indicates that the Indo-French relationship retains both its rationale and elan. France has begun to pay serious attention to the Indo-Pacific region after a long time. One reason for this is the Brexit induced unsettling of the European project. The other is the awareness that China is now mounting a challenge to the EU from the east where it has steadily built up important relationships with the erstwhile East European countries. Macron’s visit to India takes place at an important juncture in the regional geopolitics. In 2016, under his Presidency, France for the first time called for European patrols in the South China Sea. The EU ignored the suggestion since it has a neutral posture on the issue, but France has teamed up with the UK and is now regularly sending naval task forces to the region. Taken in conjunction with the emergence of the Quadrilateral Grouping (Quad) this is a significant development. Given its robust foreign policy, France has not hesitated to criticise China’s human rights record, especially the repression in Tibet, despite having significant economic interests in China. In a similar vein, it had not hesitated to criticise the US for its 2003 invasion of Iraq. France is an old friend of India. Successive Presidents have been chief guests at the Republic Day, the last being Hollande in 2016. Prime Minister Modi has visited France in 2015 and again in 2017. Given our focus on the US, sometimes it is useful to recall that France is a rich, highly industrialised country, with a nominal GDP higher than that of India and a permanent member of the UN Security Council. It is as much known for its civilisational contributions as its achievements in R&D and innovation. For this reason, India has maintained a deep relationship with France, especially in the area of aerospace and nonoil energy. France has been willing to supply us systems which countries like the US hesitate on, and at the same time, it has not embargoed India on account of wars and tension. A hallmark of the level of our current relationship is the fact that India’s cutting-edge Scorpene submarine is of French origin and we have also decided to acquire a small number of the Rafale fighters. France is a significant Indo-Pacific power. Not many know that it actually has the largest EEZ in the world, if you take into account all its scattered island territories. In the Pacific Ocean itself, it has an EEZ is over 6 million square kms, three times larger than that of India’s. It also has significant assets in the Indian Ocean, the island of Reunion and Mayotte, as well as the so-called Scattered Islands in the strategic Mozambique channel which have no settled population but have an EEZ of 6,40,000 sq kms. For this reason, France has maintained a military presence in both the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. India has been steadily enhancing its maritime posture in the Mozambique channel, the island states of Mauritius, Seychelles, and, most importantly in the Persian Gulf. France is a military presence in all these areas, besides its own territories, it also has a base in Djibouti, as well as the United Arab Emirates. India, which has significant interests in the western IOR, needs to reach out to France for three reasons. First, France has common interests in fighting piracy, freedom of navigation and the general stability of the region. Second, this is a region where we have no other partner. In the eastern IOR, India has ties with the US Pacific Command. But the Americans do not deal with us through their Central and Africa Commands that takes in the Persian Gulf and western IOR. And third, the French see the IOR territories as parts of France and are not likely to walk away from the region.

485,Amandeep Sandhu,"My Facebook timeline is flooded with pictures of the farmer march into Mumbai. 30,000 farmers have braved a five-day walk and given the ongoing SSC exams have decided to reach Azad Maidan by March 11 night itself. The farmers in Maharashtra demand debt waiver. While on social media there are already more than three memes and many cartoons doing the rounds, on the ground, Sikhs are feeding langar to the protesting marching farmers. I look at social media and people going hammer and tongs against the BJP, the talk about resurgent Left soon after Tripura debacle, and wonder where do we see ourselves in these events. Three days back another 30,000 farmers had gathered in Barnala, Punjab. They demanded implementation of the promised debt waiver. That news did not make it to national headlines. The reason was Barnala is not Bombay. The government in Punjab is Congress. I wonder if Mumbaikars will remain welcoming towards the farmers as the days pass, 1, 2, 3... traffic is inconvenienced, commuters are hassled. After all, a sea of farmers has simple needs - food and ablutions. What would urban folks on social media do then? I am reminded of a farmer protest over 35 years back, incidentally on the same dates. On March 12, 1984, more than a lakh farmers had occupied the governor house in Chandigarh. Those were the heydays of the green revolution. India was feeding on Punjab but the farmers were suffering high electricity bills. Farmers occupied the golf course, the beautiful lawns, the Sukhna Lake. You know food and ablutions. Sharad Joshi's Shetkari Sanghatana lend support to the Bhartiya Kisan Union protest. The protest lasted until March 18 when government promised a committee to look into the matter. The talks reached an impasse and Akalis jumped in to announce they will withhold wheat going to India. That became one of the many reasons for Operation Blue Star, rest is history. I am thankful there is no Darbar Sahib in Mumbai. But the real issue is - unlike what I have been reading on friends' status and media reports - that these protests are not about BJP or Congress. They are about you and me and neo-liberal policies. If farmers have to earn better we will need to pay more for food. Can we afford that? Will it not create another level of poor who can't afford food? We have all noticed how the Sensex has grown ever since 1991 when neo-liberal reforms were carried out. Ever asked yourself how much of it is based on the Agro stocks which basically are about mechanisation and factory conditions of farming whose real victims are farmers? Debt waiver is at best an intermediate solution. Unless the farm-grain market-industry-bank-money lender system changes we have no real solution for the agrarian sector. This protest, the one earlier by Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi, the one by Madhya Pradeesh farmers, and a million others, are a consequence of more than a quarter century of neglect of more than half of India's population that is dependent on agriculture. They are not about one political party or another. They are about the neo-liberal framework we have adopted as the engine of the nation's economic growth. It is the city eating the village, urban India preying upon rural India, the factory neglecting the farmer. As I travel to Punjab, learning about its huge agrarian distress, I sometimes hear the phrase ""Chorasi da geda"" - the circle of 84. Initially, I wondered if it was a reference to the Hindu belief of 8.4 million cycles of life and death. Then I realised, it was simply about the year 1984. The horror of that year. Given how the Centre has treated Punjab over the last few decades, Punjab sees itself as a food-producing colony of the nation state. When Punjab raised its voice - both identity and religion and political economy agrarian - it was dealt a hand so heavy that it has still not recovered. I hope the nation's farmers don't have to learn such a dire lesson. I hope each of us urban folks recognises our own complicity in what has happened to the agrarian sector. Memes and cartoons just go that far, they hardly solve anything. Solidarity.

486,Suraj Kumar Thube,"""The BJP used money and muscle power to win in Tripura,"" charged Sitaram Yechury, CPM general secretary, after his party's defeat in the recently concluded state elections in Tripura. This response sums up the mystical adherence of the Left to non-bourgeoisie principles. The problem with the Left Front is that it fails to understand that principles of  ""dignity"", ""survival"", ""peace"" etc fail to strike a chord with the increasingly disgruntled masses. What matters today is economic growth that is ridden with practical and logical fallacies. On the other hand, right-wing politics offers ""hope"" and ""promises"", howsoever hollow they might sound. Is there really a Left version of ""hopes"" and ""promises"" in our neo-liberal times? 
 
 With the strongest Left bastion in India succumbing to a defeat of this magnitude, questions need to be raised about its imagination of alternative futures. With the current political churning, where there seems no space for centrist politics, the baggage of not being efficient enough haunts the Left. Efficiency has always been a term associated with an individual-centric neoliberal model. The Left has failed to realise that individuals seek palpable change in their own lives. In this light, the moral victory of the CPM managing to revoke the draconian AFSPA in Tripura fails to consolidate any further support at the ground level. Similarly, their former chief minister Dasarath Deb, a tribal, was the one who largely reconciled the tribal-non tribal conflict in the 1990s, has absolutely no resonance among the present generation. When unemployment surges to 19 per cent, according to its own government's estimates, such social achievements automatically get relegated to the backburner. Similarly, to be consistently politically correct about the dangers of growing cases of Dalit-Muslim lynchings are way less important, especially for youths whose economic aspirations are sky high. They want to realise a perceptible change in their per capita income instead of hearing as to how Tripura has a respectable forest cover that will benefit the society at large. Retaining forest cover at the expense of a rise in per capita income has no buyers whatsoever. Quite simply, the repercussions of implementing the Fourth Central Pay Commission, when the rest of India has already rolled out the Seventh Central Pay Commission, are massive. Immediate concerns are always going to trump moral homilies. The Left needs to reflect on all these issues. Is it really possible to have a politics that runs counter to the one that is based on money and muscle power? Is it possible to reconcile ideological purism with the pragmatism of secular space? If not, is there a Left version of pragmatism? And most importantly, if they pay heed to the advice of primarily resisting the bourgeoning fascistic tendencies, does their core set of principles remain only a functionary of the mass movement variety with no real concern for electoral politics? The language of egalitarianism lacks the exuberance of the freedom to dream of the unthinkable. For the growing youth bulge who voted against the Left in Tripura, the stultifying quest for realising only  bare minimums in life is not good enough. As historian Sumanta Banerjee says, ""It is high time we need to demystify the masses."" At a time when identity politics of multiple hues seem to be engaged in vigorous competitive battles, the Left seems running out of ideas. With the BJP emerging as the new umbrella party of sorts accommodating different local  identities, the Left language of groups, communes and broad categories seem way too anachronistic in both form and substance. This can most certainly be seen with their near wipeout in the tribal areas comprising 20 seats. Historical goodwill of not ignoring tribal issues in the face of growing Bengali migrant population has no currency in present-day context. Moreover, as the tribal population in the state has dipped below 30  per cent over the years, the issue has seized to be of paramount importance. Nobody denies that anti-incumbency after 25 years in power was going to witness a swing of the political pendulum. The concern lies more with the nature of the defeat that is a combination of both - BJP promising the moon and the electorate themselves desperate for a change in guard. Capitalising on this secular disgruntlement is easy for a relatively new party like the BJP. Reclaiming past glory in the present obsessed with efficiency in material transformation is a completely different proposition. The Left can certainly take solace in managing to retain close to 42 per cent of vote share. However, the larger issue of a pervasive dissonance of their principles on one hand and the dreams of the electorate on the other, are here to stay. For a party which has become a minority player in their erstwhile bastion of West Bengal, to bounce back in Tripura in times of polarising politics would be an enormous task.

487,Sharat Pradhan,"The Lok Sabha constituencies of Gorakhpur and Phulpur, where by-polls will be held on March 11, have become a major challenge for the ruling BJP as well as the Opposition in Uttar Pradesh. But the stakes for the ruling dispensation are surely higher in Phulpur. The BJP, which seemed to have taken its victory on both the seats for granted, began to pull up its socks no sooner than BSP supremo Mayawati declared her decision to support the Samajwadi Party on the two seats. Since the BSP, as a rule, does not believe in contesting any by-election, it was anyway not in the race. But the party’s most unexpected decision to support its sworn political adversary in the by-poll has compelled the BJP to give up its complacence and get down to brass tacks. Even though the alliance was struck rather late in the day, when barely eight days were left for polling, there's still much exuberance visible in both the SP as well the BSP camps. And that is what seems to have spurred the BJP not only in Phulpur, where the party was never on a strong footing, but also in Gorakhpur, the political bastion of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Yogi had held the seat for five consecutive terms until he stepped down in 2017 to acquire membership of the state legislature after being installed as chief minister. Prior to that also, the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat was with Yogi Adityanath’s ""guru"" and political mentor Mahant Avaidyanath for three terms. However, that was not the case with Phulpur, widely known as Jawaharlal Nehru’s constituency and a traditional Congress stronghold, from where the BJP’s first–timer Keshav Prasad Maurya romped home with the help of the Modi wave in 2014. The seat fell vacant following his elevation as deputy chief minister, followed by his nomination to the upper house of state legislature. Even though Maurya had won the Lok Sabha seat in 2014 with a massive margin of three lakh votes, his nominee Kaushlendra Singh Patel, may not sail through with the same ease now. What came as an indirect support for him was jailed mafia don-turned-politician Atiq Ahmed (independent candidate) joining the fray. Ahmed is bound to dig into a chunk of the Muslim votes and thereby weaken the strength of the Samajwadi Party candidate Nagendra Patel. It was no surprise that the Opposition was openly terming Atiq as BJP’s “plant”. While the BSP’s support to the SP came as a shot in the arm for the anti-BJP lobby, what is being doubted is the effectiveness of the alliance due to the delay. Even a senior SP leader wondered: ""How is it going to be possible for us to get all the benefits of the BSP vote bank in such a short time?"" A BSP coordinator, however, claims, “Behen Mayawatiji took a decision to extend our party’s full support to the strongest candidate against communal forces. We have, therefore, ensured that our party’s supporters go and cast their vote for the SP nominee, since he is seen as the strongest candidate against the BJP.” If the BSP’s vote bank actually gets transferred to the SP, it could make a world of difference as there are about 3.5 lakh Dalit votes in Phulpur. Besides, the constituency has nearly three lakh Muslim voters. The SP had chosen a Patel against the BJP’s Patel nominee in a constituency with about two lakh Patel voters, but even an equal division of this community’s vote may not make as much difference as the votes of other communities. What could seriously dent the SP’s prospects was the division of the Muslim vote into three parties - the SP, the Congress and independent Atiq Ahmed. But the SP hopes to recover that loss from the unflinching support of more than one lakh Yadav voters. Ideally, the Congress could have kept out of the fray if its objective was to actually keep the BJP at bay. However, Congress spokesman Surendra Rajput argues, ""Had we allowed it to be a united fight against the BJP, then the BJP would have played the Hindutva card to polarise the votes."" The fact of the matter is that Congress nominee Manish Misra was not even capable of winning over local Brahmins, although this upper caste community with some one lakh votes was perceived to be somewhat disillusioned with the BJP. Some senior leaders of the ruling dispensation, including state BJP president Mahendra Pandey, were busy trying to woo the Brahmins in Phulpur. However, BJP’s major focus was on tapping the larger chunk of the backward castes. Maurya, who is BJP's OBC face in Uttar Pradesh, has only one lakh backward caste voters in the region. He has, however, thrived on the claim that he got the entire backward community to rally behind the BJP across the length and breadth of the state in 2017, when, under his leadership, the party created an all-time record of winning 324 seats in a 403-member state Assembly. Maurya even staked claim to the top job in Uttar Pradesh and has been quite chagrined ever since Yogi Adityanath wangled the position. Today, his own prestige is as much at stake as Yogi Adityanath’s , whose Gorakhpur is also faced with a similar challenge of a nearly united opposition. But surely Maurya’s stakes are much higher than that of Yogi, who is on a far more deeper roots in his constituency. No wonder, therefore, Maurya was leaving no stone unturned to ensure his nominee’s victory at all costs.",2018-03-09,"BJP,Gorakhpur,Phulpur,By-polls",Uttar Pradesh by-polls: Why winning Phulpur is a bigger challenge for both BJP and Opposition,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uttar-pradesh-by-polls-phulpur-gorakhpur-bjp-sp-bsp-yogi-adityanath-keshav-prasad-maurya/story/1/22754.html
488,Ashok K Singh,"Let’s not exaggerate the BJP’s victory over the CPI(M) in Tripura. No doubt, it’s unprecedented. For the first time in the electoral history of the BJP and the CPI(M), the Centre-Right has trounced the Centre-Left in a direct fight. It’s a stunning political victory. But to invest the Tripura victory with the larger symbolism of the right-wing forces having finally won the war over the Left and liberal forces in the social and cultural landscape of India is reading more into the result than it warrants. That’s why a headline in  - “Under Narendra Modi, India’s Right is finally winning the culture wars” - was eye-catching, also a bit jarring. More so because the author is Barkha Dutta, a voice identified with liberal and Centre-Left space. “The Right won resoundingly-and not just electorally”…. “The numbers themselves are marginal to why these wins are so valuable for India’s right. For them, it’s about symbolically conquering the social and cultural landscape of India.” Dutt exaggerates BJP’s so-called cultural and social victory in these words. Actually, the Left's rout in Tripura is more about numbers, less about the rightist forces having conquered the social and cultural wars in India. The BJP has dented the Left’s social and cultural space in tiny Tripura. But it’s a long way off from winning the war in India. India is too big; it’s cultural geography too vast, its social makeup too pluralistic and its linguistic and religious base too diverse to be dominated by a party, which wants to make the country socially and culturally homogenised. The nationwide storm of protests over vandalisation of Lenin’s statue in a faraway district of Tripura have sent a warning to the BJP against making any brazen attempts to paint the entire cultural space of India in saffron.  The BJP’s hurried steps to dissociate the party from the vandalisation of the statue, the entire leadership, including Prime Minster Narendra Modi and the party president Amit Shah getting into the act to condemn the incidents show the BJP is not yet confident of winning the cultural war. Ram Madhav, the BJP general secretary and one of the architects of the Tripura victory, too mistakenly thought the BJP had won ideological contest until he received a rude shock that the reality was different. Who would think the BJP had won the ideological war if the demolition of a Lenin’s statue, which appeals mainly to the Left parties that are hardly electorally relevant outside West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, could force BJP’s top brass to go on the back foot? I don’t recall when was the last Modi reacted with so much alacrity - within hours - to publicly condemn an event of this nature? They had kept quiet for weeks and months even after national uproar over events such as killings of Muslims by rampaging cow lynch mobs and violence against Dalits. Modi and Shah hit the panic button when an over enthusiastic party leader H Raja’s call for demolition of EVR Ramasamy, popularly known as Periyar, in Tamil Nadu led to defacing of Tamil’s cultural and social icon’s statue. Periyar represents the anti-thesis of BJP’s social and cultural philosophy. Espousing atheism, opposed to worship of lord Rama and Hindu deities and virulently opposed to Brahmanism-led social order, the Tamil icon is even a greater threat to the RSS ideology than the Communists. Almost the entire political class in Tamil Nadu rose in revolt against the BJP. Selective attacks on some Brahmin Hindus wearing sacred threads alarmed the BJP, which, perhaps, needed to be reminded that the Dravidian parties rule in Tamil Nadu and their culture is at odds with the RSS. A deeper analysis of the BJP’s win in Tripura would show that it’s not the victory of the RSS’s ideology as much as it’s an achievement of the BJP’s electoral machine. It’s the caste and sectarian arithmetic, which the party enthusiasts call social engineering, micro-management down to the booth level and above all huge anti-incumbency that caused the rout of the Left government. Almost total decimation of the Congress, as an alternative to the CPI(M), is another major factor behind the BJP’s stupendous performance. From 10 MLAs in 2013, the Congress has been reduced to zero. The Congress’ vote share dropped from 36.5 per cent in 2013 to 1.8 per cent in 2018. The BJP that has emerged in Tripura is socially, culturally and politically nothing, but the old Congress. The BJP has adopted poaching from its rivals as a strategy to build its base in states where it doesn’t have presence. In Tripura, for instance, BJP fielded as many as 14 candidates who were sitting Congress legislators or former Congress MLAs. Barring two, all won. Seven Congress MLAs had deserted the party to join the Trinamool Congress in the run up to the election. All of them ultimately joined the BJP. Some from CPI(M) too were poached and at least one won the election. In West Bengal earlier, almost the entire Congress vote base had shifted to Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress, which emerged as an alternative to the Left Front. In Tripura, the victorious BJP is primarily the erstwhile Congress. The BJP hasn’t won the cultural and social war in Tripura. It has been Congressised. In Tripura, the BJP represents the same Congress culture that Modi swears to fight and make India Congress-mukt.",2018-03-10,"Lenin statue,Left,Manik sarkar,BJP",Why BJP is still far from winning the cultural war,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tripura-bjp-right-left-manik-sarkar-lenin-statue-amit-shah-modi-biplab-deb/story/1/22758.html
489,Rakesh Kotti,"When the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh tweeted that his phone call wasn't answered by the PMO, I felt insulted not just as an Andhrite, but also as an Indian. However, I believe that N Chandrababu Naidu tweeting about his grievance is a tactical bid to play to the gallery in order to elicit sympathy for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). 
 
 The TDP has sensed that people might question it over the demand in the next Assembly election given the fact leaders of Congress from Andhra Pardesh have been protesting in Delhi since March 6 for the same. It may be recalled that at the time of bifurcating the state, the UPA government had announced that Andhra will be accorded the special category status for a period of five years. However, both the BJP and TDP demanded that it be extended to 10 years. Post elections, the NDA government went back on its word and denied the special category status to the state and in August 2015, a bandh was called to protest this breach of trust. All parties, except the TDP supported the bandh in which, Muni Ramakoti, a Congress worker unfortunately lost his life after he immolated himself. Both the TDP and BJP were unmoved. However, sensing that the anger against the TDP and BJP was rising, a   was announced in lieu of the special category status in 2016. The special package was welcomed by the TDP which joined the BJP in congratulating the then minister, Venkaiah Naidu, for ""getting the special package"" for Andhra Pradesh. The cadre of the two parties, joined by some leaders including TDP minister Vallabhaneni Vamsi Mohan, took out a rally to honour Venkaiah Naidu, in Vijayawada. When some people protested with black flags over the promise of special category status not being met, they were promptly taken into custody by the police. Yet, it took Chandrababu Naidu, two years to realise that the special category status is cardinal for the development of Andhra Pradesh. Of course, the TDP expects that the public will develop amnesia and overlook the fact that they welcomed the special package, in lieu of the special status and even boycotted the protests demanding that electoral promises be honoured. If Chandrababu Naidu wanted to be taken seriously, he should have taken the decision to quit the government long back. Even if the TDP was break its alliance with the BJP for now, there is no guarantee that it won't return to the party at an opportune time. Given Chandrababu Naidu's record of flip-flops, he suffers a serious crisis of credibility. Earlier, he protested the bifurcation of the state, but post bifurcation, he claimed credit for it at a rally in Mahbubnagar, in Telangana. Likewise, he first supported demonetisation, asserting that it was his idea (he recommended it in October 2016) but later said it was not what he wished for. Once again, he clarified to the press that he was misquoted, and he only said that he supports demonetisation but not its implementation that caused a debilitating currency crunch, (even though he headed a 13-member committee to promote digital payments post the noteban). It may be argued that the Andhra CM was miffed with the PMO for ignoring his phone call which is an insult to the people of Andhra. However, Chandrababu Naidu is not a stickler for political propriety. When he attended the World Economic Forum, earlier this year, his brother-in-law, N Balakrishna,   and reviewed the implementation of government programmes. This serious breach of protocol, where a constitutional office was chaired by a person, by virtue of his relation to the incumbent was never addressed by the CM. It is therefore unlikely that he was irked by the PMO not answering his call. What is most likely is that he is anxious about the growing anger in people. With the Opposition gaining traction backed by Rahul Gandhi's promise of according the state the special category status if the Congress comes to power in 2019, a nervous Naidu was compelled to act. If he was serious about registering his protest over the issue, Chandrababu Naidu would have quit the alliance (not just the government) and joined the Opposition in the agitation. And since Chandrababu Naidu and the TDP appear to be suffering from political schizophrenia or amnesia - or both - it will be good for their ally BJP to remind them about the love-hate relationship they share. In 2002, Naidu called for Modi's ouster post Gujarat riots. With Modi not resigning, Naidu waited till 2005 to break the TDP's alliance with the BJP. In 2009, when asked if he will support the BJP, Naidu's curt reply was, ""No, never. Not even after the polls.""",2018-03-08,"TDP,BJP,Venkaiah Naidu,TDP-BJP alliance",Chandrababu Naidu's threat to break alliance with BJP is mere posturing,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrababu-naidu-tdp-bjp-alliance-venkaiah-naidu-bjp-tdp/story/1/22719.html
490,Amarnath K Menon,"Seldom has Prime Minister Narendra Modi's National Democratic Alliance been in the manner the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has done this week. When Parliament resumed its Budget session, on March 5, TDP supremo and Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu got party MPs, who were joined by those from other parties in AP, to join the chorus demanding special category status (SCS), which mandates the central government to grant special fiscal incentives and other concessions to the state. However, the situation had worsened by Thursday morning, March 8, with TDP threatening to withdraw its two MPs from the government over the Centre's refusal to give Andhra Pradesh central funding under SCS. TDP lawmaker Ravindra Babu   that pulling out the ministers was the first step. The next ""logical step"" was to exit the alliance.  What seems to have actually spoilt the relationship between the two parties is finance minister Arun Jaitley's disdainful comment to a delegation from the state which met him that AP had not rendered accounts for the   the Centre had extended to bridge the revenue gap following reorganisation of the state and carving out Telangana with the revenue-centric Hyderabad as its capital. The central government also made no bones about its stand in not extending more benefits to AP arguing this would give rise to similar demands from other states, including Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. Driven to the wall, he hurriedly convened a meeting of the TDP legislature party on March 6 to explain to party legislators the state's uncompromising stand. ""The Centre has never asked us to submit utilisation certificates. But as a state, we have done it voluntarily, and on our own submitted all utilisation certificates. They are also available on the website. Their officials are perhaps ignorant that the central government's website itself states that AP occupies the third position in the country in submitting the certificates,"" declared Naidu, peeved by the disparaging comments against the state. As TDP leaders turned up the heat on the BJP for its ""haughty ways"" for not meeting the financial and other commitments, as provided for in the AP State Reorganisation Act, some in the state BJP were annoyed over Naidu failing to see the obvious in the rival YSR Congress chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy's campaign for SCS. They believe that Reddy raised the issue only as a bait for Naidu and are surprised that in the face of adversity, a seasoned leader like Naidu, instead of remaining unruffled and getting carried away was targeting the central government. So, according to a well-crafted and a nuanced strategy, Naidu took the central government on, the following day, March 7, while replying to the debate on the motion of thanks to governor ESL Narasimhan for his address on the opening day - March 5. ""The central government has not honoured what is provided for in the law relating to reorganisation of AP in the spirit of cooperative federalism and granting the state its rights including SCS,"" thundered Naidu. He pointed out these were among the assurances sought and received among others by the then Opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha and now finance minister Arun Jaitley as well as the current Rajya Sabha chairman and vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu. ""What is happening to Andhra Pradesh is unjust. It hurts the people's sentiments and they will not forgive us,"" argued the chief minister explaining in the course of a 150-minute address about unkept assurances and short-changing on release of funds as promised and provided for by law. ""If we have moved up the rungs in the ease of doing business, notching high economic growth and stabilising our agriculture it is largely due to the dint of hard work of the five crore residents of the state,"" reasoned Naidu. He repeatedly referred to the state getting an unfair deal reading out numbers on how the Centre was more helpful to other states and their development projects. But he stopped short of saying what the TDP will do going ahead though ""precious little has been provided in the last four years and there is nothing significant in the latest Union Budget."" However, he made it abundantly clear that AP's interests were paramount to his party and that is why when the TDP had a larger number of MPs in the undivided state, he extended support to the Vajpayee government without seeking any ministerial berths ""in the larger national interest of the state"". It is a veiled hint of how Naidu is inching closer to the high moral ground in the run-up to the next Assembly elections.

491,Minhaz Merchant,"A key failure of the Narendra Modi government has been its inability - or unwillingness - to break the vice-like grip the deep state has over Indian policy-making and public discourse. The deep state is no leviathan monster. Rather it's an intricate network of politicians, bureaucrats, former judges, retired armed forces officers, senior lawyers, journalists, activists and power brokers. For decades, this tight circle controlled India's political, economic and social narrative. Corruption and nepotism bound them together. Many were subverted by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency and toed the aman ki asha line. Maoists were lionised. Police officers who fought insurgencies and terrorism were prosecuted. When the Sonia Gandhi remotely-led UPA government was in office, this powerful and incestuous cabal was in its element. Its members dominated Sonia's National Advisory Council (NAC). Journalists meanwhile, fell under the spell of public relations operators like Niira Radia. Those were the go-go years of 2004-08. The global economy was on steroids. Foreign investors were pouring into India. The stock market boomed. The then finance minister P Chidambaram was the toast of the town. I interviewed him in his spacious North Block office in September 2004. For the best part of an hour, Chidambaram's eyes rarely left the television screen placed on the wall to his right, flashing the latest stock prices. As S Gurumurthy, speaking recently about the deep state said, key appointments in the bureaucracy, judiciary and various institutions of governance like the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) were made on the basis of personal connections and loyalty, not merit. Those appointees, still occupy positions of authority. Gurumurthy is a former adviser to the late redoubtable Ramnath Goenka, founder of  . A chartered accountant, Gurumurthy has audited the balance sheets of India's top companies. A single armed guard stands at the entrance to his office in Chennai where I interview him. Much of the conversation is off-the record but I do ask him a question that puzzles many Indians: after nearly four years in power, why has the Narendra Modi government moved so slowly to indict, prosecute and jail obvious economic offenders across sectors - from real estate to television media. Gurumurthy answers with deliberate precision. He says the Modi government is moving carefully because of the deep state that still controls key levers of power: politicians, lawyers, judges, bureaucrats, media, NGOs. Isn't it extraordinary, I ask him, that a shrewd politician and hard taskmaster like Modi hasn't been able to cut this cabal down to size? The rest of our conversation was off-the-record. On three occasions he requested the tape recorder be switched off while he spoke. Corruption lies at the heart of the problem. Virtually every defence deal during UPA1 and UPA2 allegedly came with kickbacks in foreign tax havens. The money was round-tripped back to India in real estate companies and other businesses. Corrupt politicians are the real owners of these companies fronted by benami ""businessmen"". Money was laundered by benami entrepreneurs, some of whom have been investigated for years at glacial speed. Even in the Karti Chidambaram case, courts have been ""compassionate"", to cite Gurumurthy, giving him leeway to  , agree to adjournments by Karti's legal team and delay court proceedings. More worryingly is the surreptitious help the deep state, flush with ill-gotten wealth of the past and loyal to old masters, receives from within the Modi government. Most Modi cabinet ministers are sincere, honest and hardworking. But there are holdovers with loyalties to the past. With one year to go for the next Lok Sabha election, what options does Modi have to cleanse the subverted ecosystem he inherited? He should focus on the finance ministry where much power resides. Then he should turn his attention to the defence ministry which is crucial to safeguarding India's national security and upgrading a deeply eroded military. Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman is honest and able but does she have untrammelled authority? Two recent episodes were disconcerting. First, the cloud over whether the defence minister gave Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti permission to file an FIR against Major Aditya Kumar following the Shopian incident. This has belatedly been clarified with the J&K government telling the Supreme Court on March 5 that Major Aditya was not included in the FIR as an accused. The apex court has stayed the investigation till April 24. The second episode concerns the defence ministry's mean-spirited decision to go ahead with imposing a cap of Rs 10,000 a month on educational grants to the children of armed forces martyrs. The maximum additional burden removing the cap would have imposed? Rs 3.20 crore. Despite representations by armed forces officers that the cap would affect the morale of soldiers facing Pakistan's mortar shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) and terror attacks in J&K, the defence ministry has refused to remove the cap. It is such lack of common sense and empathy in government decision-making that the deep state thrives on. To end its influence, Modi must take the bull by the horns. Karti Chidambaram's arrest showed new intent and urgency. Much more remains to be done.

492,Rajeev Sharma,"Narendra Modi the politician has taken over from Narendra Modi the prime minister in turning India's over six-decade-old policy on Tibet and Tibetan spiritual leader  on its head. But why this sudden change in India's policy towards the Dalai Lama? It's an open secret that in the Modi dispensation only one man's writ prevails on all issues - PM Modi. At this juncture, nothing matters more to Modi and the BJP than winning the next general elections, due by April-May 2019 but may well be advanced by a few months. China can rock Modi's boat in a big way. That's why, from Modi's perspective, it is absolutely essential that China cooperates with the Modi government and not create problems. To seek China's cooperation, the Modi government has extended an olive branch to China on its soft underbelly, the Dalai Lama, who is dubbed by China as a “splittist” and a “dangerous separatist”. This is the only explanation for cabinet secretary PK Sinha sending a note (dated February 22 but sent on February 26 presumably after PMO's vetting) to all central ministries and departments as well as all state governments which says ""senior leaders"" and ""government functionaries"" of the Centre and states should stay away from commemorative events planned for March-end and early April by the ""Tibetan leadership in India"" to mark the start of 60 years in exile of the Dalai Lama. The main event of Dalai Lama targeted by the Modi government is ""Thank You India"" being organised at  in New Delhi on April 1. Dalai Lama’s government-in-exile also intends to invite a number of Indian dignitaries for this event which is likely to be followed up by additional events in Delhi as well as other Indian states. Significantly, the cabinet secretary's circular was sent on the advice of the new foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale who until a few months back was Indian ambassador in China and had played a key role in resolution of the 73-day-long Doklam standoff. The cabinet secretary quoted Gokhale’s note to underline “the sensitive nature of the subject”. In his note to the cabinet secretary the foreign secretary stated: “The proposed period will be a very sensitive time in the context of India’s relations with China. Participation by senior leaders or government functionaries, either from the central government or state governments, is not desirable, and should be discouraged.” Modi knows that China is seething over India's unprecedented defiance and a strong stand over the Doklam issue last summer. Although the crisis was resolved after 73 days, Modi has been tipped off by his intelligence apparatus that China may trigger a bigger crisis in Doklam and elsewhere in this summer. Such a scenario would be politically disastrous for Modi, who during the 2014 election campaign had hauled the then Congress government over coals for its submissive approach to China. In the event of China triggering yet another major flashpoint, the Modi government would be pushed on the back foot and the Congress-led Opposition will get a stick to beat the BJP with in the run-up to the next general elections. Only yesterday (March 5)  told parliament that China has built helipads and trenches in Doklam. It's because of this that Modi has turned India's six-decade-old foreign policy on its head. As per Modi's political calculations a possible China-triggered flashpoint would be more harmful for his political future than turning his back on the Dalai Lama. At best, the Opposition would cry foul and issue angry statements against the move, but China would be mollified. Had there been a strong and United Opposition, it would have made life miserable for the government and the prime minister, accusing the government of being soft and pliable and reversing decades-old Indian policy for his short-term political gains. The Opposition has solid reasons to blast the Modi government as it has unilaterally changed a vital component of Indian foreign policy without taking the Opposition into confidence. And that too at a time when the Modi government should have done exactly the opposite after China recently violated two bilateral MoUs and refused to share upstream data on  and cut off Indian pilgrims' access to two sacred sites in Tibet. The Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement on March 2, a national holiday on account of the Holi festival, and said thus: “The government’s position on His Holiness the Dalai Lama is clear and consistent. He is a revered religious leader and is deeply respected by people of India. There is no change in that position. He is accorded all freedom to carry out his religious activities in India.” However, the MEA kept mum on the cabinet secretary's note. The Modi government is exercising more caution than ever before in dealing with China not just because PM Modi will be travelling to China in June this year for attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. But it's not for this multilateral event that he has changed his government’s policy on the Dalai Lama in one stroke. He is eyeing much bigger prize in lieu: an India visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is now practically the Chinese president for life after the Chinese Communist Party made changes in its rules. A visit to India by Xi later this year would effectively mean that the Xi-led China won't be rocking India's boat and would presumably refrain from staging the much feared Doklam II. The master political move by Modi makes it clear that it’s more by Modi the politician, rather than Modi, the prime minister.",2018-03-06,"BJP,Modi,India-China Ties,The Dalai Lama",Why Modi government is willing to snub the Dalai Lama to pacify China,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/the-dalai-lama-event-delhi-modi-government-india-china-ties-thank-you-india/story/1/22695.html
493,DS Rai,"For the past 14 years, Madhya Pradesh has been ruled by the BJP. And even though many in the state think that the BJP is invincible, a desire for change is gradually gaining strength.   It seems that the people of the state may finally choose the Congress over the BJP. This is also indicated by the Congress’s successive wins in four by-elections in the past one year. However, going by the full-page advertisements of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in local newspapers, an uninformed observer is likely to conclude that Chouhan is as popular as before. Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was once his contemporary, Chouhan too has made elections his priority, and often at the cost of governance.   In the past decade, the chief minister has projected every election victory (big or small) as his own alone.   Unsurprisingly, his detractors believe that the Madhya Pradesh chief minister often ignores government work for election work.  However, with recent losses in by-elections, Chouhan’s critics in his party have been quick to lay the blame for the loss at CM’s door. One of those is former BJP MP Raghunandan Sharma who said, that the loss in the Mungaoli and Kolaras by-elections was ""failure of one person and not of the party"". In the past 12 years of Chouhan’s rule, the BJP-RSS combine (it’s hard to distinguish between them in MP), have ensured that their workers and functionaries are benefitted financially, often, through government contracts, tenders and schemes. Most of the public works are now executed by BJP workers-turned-contractors. A majority of the state’s locally elected bodies like ""mandis"", marketing and cooperative societies and municipal bodies are now controlled by the BJP and so is the flow of government funds. The BJP-RSS and the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government have made it routine to organise massive functions in the name of festivals, anniversaries and occasions at huge costs incurred by the state exchequer. In addition to such functions, a number of other religion-based events are organised by the BJP-RSS  network of cadres and workers. BJP MLAs and local leaders in their constituencies and areas of influence replicate this template of event management. These are almost always conducted in the presence of priests and ""godmen"" of questionable reputations. Unsurprisingly, those of us living in MP have not failed to notice a sharp growth in the number of religious (Hindu) events and pseudo-religiosity in the state over the past decade or so. More shockingly perhaps, even government officers are expected to use their clout and arrange for logistics and even crowds for such events. Under the threat of falling out of favour with their political bosses, the officers quietly do as expected.   A large number of government-appointed or government-dependent ASHA and Aanganwadi workers as well panchayat secretaries form a bulk of crowds at such gatherings. In fact, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has become so brazen that is has been issuing formal orders to district collectors and other officers asking them to bring in crowds. The most recent example of this is a meeting of workers organised in Jabalpur on February 24.  Naturally, governance is the loser in all of this. Although government officers are not given to airing their views publicly, the fact is that all over the state, officers are fed up of doing what is essentially the political work of the government for more than a decade. My own sense is that most of them genuinely want a change in government in the upcoming assembly elections in the state. They are so pestered by the government that whenever a retired bureaucrat happens to talk about the ""good old days"", they bluntly retort, ""Sir, please don’t talk about those days. Things have change drastically since then"". While the BJP has been successful in expanding its base across castes and tribes, often through religious gurus, the Congress has all, but lost its traditional voter base among Muslims, STs, and SCs.   In the 2013 Assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, these communities voted massively in favour of the BJP.   In many areas of the state, the Congress doesn’t even have booth-level workers, the BJP, on the other hand, has acquired remarkable expertise on booth management. However, the upcoming Assembly elections are going to be Congress’s best shot at unseating the BJP from power. According to some surveys there have been more than 150 scams covering many ministries in the MP government in the past years. The biggest and the most infamous of these is the Vyapam (recruitment and admission) scam.  Although it has to be  remembered that the Congress has so far not been able to ""exploit"" these scams to its own political advantage. The reason for this is an open secret: Congress is a divided house in Madhya Pradesh. Its four major leaders, Kamalnath, Digvijaya Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Arun Yadava have shared a public stage barely once in the past year.  With just a few months to go before the elections, a planned endeavour to reach out to the state’s people is still not visible. The grand old party’s problems are further compounded by a crippling crunch of funds  - an area in which the BJP is far ahead. A large section of Congress workers and the general public believe that only with Scindia as its CM-nominee does the part have any chance of defeating the BJP.   The reasons for this are three-fold: Scindia enjoys a clean image, has freshness of approach and youthful appearance, and is a good orator.   If Scindia is soon declared the Congress’s chief ministerial candidate and allowed to work with a free hand then the party will be able to galvanise public mood in its favour. However, the Congress is known to remain in hibernation until the last moment and for not taking the right decisions at the right time.   Scindia too needs to step out of his traditional fiefdom of Guna and Gwalior and reach out to the entire state if he is to be a serious contender to incumbent chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Despite the handicaps mentioned above, the Congress can come back to power because the people of the state desperately want a change.  Whether it is on social indices like IMR, MMR, malnutrition and education, or crimes against women, Dalits and children, Madhya Pradesh is at the bottom of the spectrum. A large section of people in the state depends on agriculture and feels that it has neither been getting its due nor any real and meaningful sympathy despite a large number of farm suicides in the state. Along with this, corruption has become rampant in the state and has infected every level and arm of the government. There is no respect for government administration and credibility of government is at an all-time low; ideas like the ""Ministry of Happiness"" only underscore the grave intellectual and policy-level bankruptcy of the government. The only visible signs of any development in the state are roads and improved electricity supply, but these too are now crumbling because of corruption and mismanagement. In short, the people of MP want change, but the question is: can Congress get its act together in time to be an alternative?",2018-03-06,"Congress,Shivraj Singh Chouhan,BJP,Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections",14 years of BJP rule in Madhya Pradesh: Will Congress pull through?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/madhya-pradesh-assembly-elections-bjp-shivraj-singh-chouhan-congress/story/1/22689.html
494,Ashok K Singh,"BJP general secretary Ram Madhav on Monday was gloating in triumphalism over the takedown of a   from Tripura’s Belonia College Square. Within 48 hours of notching up a stunning victory in the Assembly elections, Ram Madhav (in his tweet) appeared to suggest, that removal of a life size bronze statue of Lenin was a historical task accomplished. He, however, later deleted the tweet. The “Chalo Paltai” crowd went on razing sculpture, attacking CPI(M) workers and party offices after “takhta palat” (dethroning) of the Manik Sarkar-led government. After a storm of protest on social media,   spoke to the Tripura governor and the state police chief and asked them to ensure peace before the swearing-in of the new government. BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli offered a poor damage-control defence of what could be construed as instigation to party workers to indulge in vandalism. “BJP doesn’t ever practice culture of violence. In places like Tripura, Left parties have chosen to be silent about 11 BJP workers who were killed. Some of those who support Left parties are trying to foist these kind of debates that a statue is removed,” Kohli told ANI. However, Tripura governor   have condoned the act of vandalism. The governor said, ""What one democratically elected government can do another democratically elected government can undo. And vice versa."" Swamy was more forthright. ""Lenin is a foreigner and in a way, a terrorist, there shouldn't be a statue of this sort of person in our country? They are welcome to put that statue inside the Communist Party headquarters and worship it if they so wish,"" he told ANI. Statues are inanimate objects. They become important when emotions get attached to them. Inanimate objects turn into living memorials and become part of history and folklore. BJP workers can remove Lenin’s statue, but can they erase history? The Left Front government that was in power in Tripura for a quarter of a century, in two installments, has been defeated. But those 25 years can’t be erased from public memory and history. In the current Assembly itself, the CPI(M) represents 45 per cent of the total electorate. The share of votes has not been translated into seats, but that’s a vagary of our electoral system. The BJP can’t erase 45 per cent of the people. On Twitter and other social media platforms, BJP supporters defended the statue’s takedown by venting their ire against CPI(M)’s foreign-influenced ideology. Lenin, a Russian by birth, has no place on the Indian soil, they argued. Are they sure the BJP’s ideology has no ingredients of foreign influence? Are they sure the Guruji’s   entertained no foreign influence? Those very people who get so revolted by foreign influences had organised havans and pujas for the victory of the US President Donald Trump. They thought a new avatar was born in the US who would slay the evil forces residing in the West. The avatar has done no favours to those who sought god’s benediction for him. The Modi government and the people of India were rightly hurt when Ghana decided in October 2016 to remove the statute of  . More than 1,000 university teachers and academics in Ghana had signed an online petition to their government demanding removal of the statue in protest against what they called Gandhiji’s “racist identity”. The statue was erected there barely a couple of months earlier after the then President Pranab Mukherjee had gifted it to Ghana. Gandhiji’s sculpture was shifted from the university square hurriedly lest it could be vandalised. As for Lenin and his sculptures, there could be no more alien place to have a status of Lenin than the US, which the BJP the Modi government are so much enamoured of. This writer was surprised to see a statue of Lenin standing at a prominent public corner in Seattle, the US during a visit there some years ago. The Russian communist revolutionary who is so reviled in the mecca of capitalism has become a landmark in Seattle along with the famous Fremont Troll sculpture in the quirky and artistic neighbourhood of the city. Lenin’s sculpture is on tourists’ itinerary in the city that headquarters Microsoft, Starbucks and Boeing and is home to the billionaire Bill Gates. The Seattle city council periodically comes under pressure from the communist baiters to remove the statue. However, there are some who oppose the move. None of those who oppose the removal are communists. Some of them favour seeing Lenin as a relic of the past, some are reminded of the Cold War that tormented the US and some recollect the dreaded years of living under Soviet nuclear arms threat. For some, the 16-foot-tall statute is just an object of curiosity. Seattle’s Lenin statue has an interesting history. In 1981, Czechoslovakia’s communist party commissioned Bulgarian sculptor Emil Venkov for Lenin’s sculpture that was installed in 1988. In 1989, it was taken down during the Velvet Revolution and was lying in a scrapyard until an American teacher of English Lewis E Carpenter came across it, bought it and carted it to Seattle in 1993. It has been standing in Fremont neighbourhood since then. Relics of Soviet Union and the most potent symbol of communist ideology, Vladimir Lenin, no longer pose threat to America. The capitalist oligarchy of Vladimir Putin does. The Seattle city council has kept the sculpture on tourists’ must-see itinerary because Lenin poses no threat to the people over there. But the BJP seems to be haunted by the spectre of Lenin. It has to dismantle sculptures, art and history associated with Lenin lest the politics associated with the relics might come alive. That’s a possibility the BJP has to contend with.",2018-03-06,"Ram Madhav,CPM,BJP,Tripura Lenin statue",What bulldozing Lenin statue in Tripura says about BJP's brazen politics,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tripura-lenin-statue-bjp-cpm-ram-madhav-chalo-paltai-governor-tathagata-roy-subramanian-swamy/story/1/22691.html
495,Anand Kochukudy,"Extending its poor run in Assembly elections since losing power at the Centre in 2014, Congress has been completely wiped out from Tripura and Nagaland. It has also   despite emerging as the single-largest party in the state. As had happened in Goa and Manipur in 2017, the BJP has come from behind to cobble together a rainbow alliance in Meghalaya with merely 2 MLAs. While Congress did show some decisiveness in sending its top troubleshooter Ahmed Patel along with senior leaders Kamal Nath and Mukul Wasnik to the state quickly, it was apparently too late in the day. The Congress' lack of foresight in anticipating all kinds of results was once again sorely exposed even as BJP's Ram Madhav and Himanta Biswas Sarma ensured that they struck a deal in less than 24 hours. Congress has been ruling Meghalaya since 2003 but for a year's break in 2008. The resultant anti-incumbency and BJP holding power at the Centre played its part in non-Congress parties coming together, facilitated by the BJP. In the bargain, the National People's Party (NPP) led by  , son of the late Purno Sangma, has emerged as the leader of the alliance with 19 MLAs, supported by regional parties UDP, HSPDP and the newly formed PDF. Sangma paraded 34 MLAs as he went to meet the governor on Sunday evening, March 4, and will be sworn in as the chief minister on Tuesday. The BJP's stated aim of a ""Congress-mukt Bharat"" is becoming a reality at a faster pace than anybody would have imagined with the grand old party now relegated to merely three full-fledged states - Punjab, Karnataka and Mizoram. Karnataka goes to polls in a couple of months and Mizoram at the end of this year. Rahul Gandhi's  at another crucial moment has invited criticism from all corners and deservedly so. In fact, Congress campaign in all three northeastern states that went to polls in February was low-key and Rahul Gandhi visited Meghalaya just a couple of times in the run-up to the elections. It almost seemed that the Congress was resigned to losing the polls even before the election. This lethargy despite putting up an impressive performance in Gujarat and claiming moral victory doesn't bode well as general elections are due next year. With BJP aggressively expanding in state after state in every region, Congress seems to have worked out the opposite strategy of putting all their eggs in one basket and concentrating on a single state at a time like regional outfits. While all their energy was focussed on Gujarat earlier, it seems Karnataka has now replaced Gujarat as the focal point. While the electoral significance of Karnataka cannot be understated, this strategy is not likely to work against the marauding BJP if Congress wishes to retain its position as the national alternative. It parallels the strategy adopted by the Left in the heydays of Indira Gandhi when they were reduced to an insignificant force in the Hindi belt. The obvious problem with this strategy is that, even after putting all their resources to use in Gujarat, Congress still came up short. And in Karnataka, despite being on a solid wicket, anything less than an outright win will surely prompt the JDS to strike an alliance with the BJP (despite assurances to the contrary by Deve Gowda) and displace Congress. The pre-poning of the general elections to coincide with the Assembly elections to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram is predicated on such a result. While Congress leaders claim off the record that a severe cash crunch is one of their biggest constraints, it simply cannot be an excuse for a party that ruled New Delhi for two terms in the immediate past, apart from its legacy since independence. The Nagaland Congress unit has been on record claiming that they were left to fend for themselves as the party merely put up candidates in 18 of the 60 constituencies. Even in Tripura, where the Congress got 45 per cent of the vote share in the 48 seats it contested in 2013, the party drew a blank this time on account of the apathy of the central leadership thereby ceding its space in entirety to the BJP. This kind of mismanagement is criminal and the Congress cannot afford it at this crucial juncture. The Northeast region's eight states command a total of 25 seats, 14 of them in Assam alone. And Congress' diminishing fortunes in the region can be traced back to the events leading up to the Assembly elections in Assam in 2016 and Himanta Biswas Sarma's revolt and alleged humiliation by Rahul Gandhi. It seems Congress is still paying for   as Sarma is not only key to BJP in Assam but hugely popular in adjacent states as well. BJP made him the convener of the North East Democratic alliance (NEDA) formed to bring all the non-Congress parties under the NDA umbrella and it has paid off spectacularly for the party once only known for its existence in the Hindi belt. Congress had long ignored the electoral significance of Northeast and had depended on being in power at the Centre and the ""intelligence network"" that runs parallel to elected governments in some of these states. True, BJP seems to have deep pockets and an unlimited supply of cash through its capitalist friends and other sources. But sadly, Congress hasn't learned much from the disasters in Goa and Manipur, where they had emerged as the single-largest party but was outsmarted by the BJP. Or, it could be argued that smaller parties have been wary of the Congress' inability to keep its flock together in Arunachal Pradesh and BJP's ability to induce legislators to switch sides. Congress could do better than having just CP Joshi as the pointsman for its strategy in the Northeast by having a designated general secretary in-charge for every state, however big or small. The feudal system of extending patronage and keeping decision-making centralised, especially after losing power in New Delhi, is not fit for the politics of the day and the party is learning it the hard way. It's time Congress delegated more powers to the lower levels and improved its man management. Despite being hamstrung by corruption allegations and the ban on coal mining getting pinned on them, the party still came up with a decent performance against a fragmented Opposition but still couldn't form a government. The blame for this situation rests squarely with the central leadership of Congress that has once again been caught napping. With its failure to negotiate a deal with the Samajwadi Party to be the sole contestant in the Phulpur by-election against the BJP, everything now rests on Karnataka for Indian National Congress.",2018-03-05,"BJP,Amit Shah,Congress,Northeast elections",Congress failing to form government in Meghalaya is a new low,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/meghalaya-meghalaya-assembly-elections-northeast-elections-congress-amit-shah-bjp/story/1/22668.html
496,Sharat Pradhan,"Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo   on Sunday, March 4, to support the Samajwadi Party (SP) in by-polls to two Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh later this month has come as a big surprise to all those who have been witness to the bitterness that has prevailed between the two parties for nearly three decades. No wonder, there is great scepticism among political observers, who are seeing beyond what meets the eye in the development. Visibly, this may appear to be a good beginning towards a ""mahagathbandhan"" (grand alliance) against the increasingly powerful Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). However, this could also be a ploy on the part of a shrewd Mayawati to make an entry into the Rajya Sabha. Without spelling out her own political ambitions, she went on record to state, ""I would expect Samajwadi Party to support the BSP nominee for Rajya Sabha, while we would extend support to their candidate in the state legislative council."" Refraining from describing the move as a precursor to a ""mahagathbandhan"", she sought to clarify, ""All that my party men have resolved to do is to extend support to the party that has the best potential to give BJP a run for its money at the forthcoming by-elections to two Lok Sabha seats in UP."" The by-poll is due on March 11 in  , the two prominent parliamentary constituencies, vacated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, respectively. Both have got berths in the state legislative council (upper house of the state legislature). Theoretically, Mayawati's announcement means a lot and is seen as a ""good beginning"" towards the formation of a grand alliance against the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But it may be too far-fetched to assume that this last-minute declaration would make any major impact on the by-elections. The announcement notwithstanding, whether it would be possible for Mayawati to transfer her party's votes to the Samajwadi Party within such a short span of time remains a million dollar question. After all, BSP supporters are largely the economically weaker Dalits, who have little access to television news. Even we were to assume that they do have access to the TV news, it may not prove so simple to convince a fairly large section of Dalits to vote for a party believed to be dominated by Yadavs, who are considered the biggest oppressors of the downtrodden Dalits. It would have been a different matter if the move was to be treated as the first step towards a Bihar like grand alliance against the BJP. But such a grand alliance would not be complete till the Congress joins in. Mayawati's announcement hasn't come without preconditions, the foremost being SP's support for a Rajya Sabha berth. Each aspirant for Rajya Sabha requires a minimum of 38 votes from members of the state Assembly. With a paltry strength of just 17 in the UP Assembly, Mayawati was far short of numbers which she could get only from Samajwadi Party, which has a strength of 46. Here too what Mayawati is understood to have demanded that the SP gives the BSP Rajya Sabha candidate its first preference votes to ensure a smooth sail. The SP can do so only by sacrificing its own candidate. In the event of SP pushing its own nominee first, it would have only 8 surplus votes to be passed on to Mayawati. Now, assuming that additional support of Congress party's seven members would also be forthcoming, Mayawati would still remain six short of the desired figure of 38. That is the reason Mayawati is understood to be insisting on ensuring the first preference support from SP. Evidently, while both SP and BSP have been busy proclaiming that their main objective is to fight ""communal forces"" (read BJP), the fact of the matter is that Mayawati is seeking her pound of flesh from SP. Relations between Mayawati and then SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav soured after SP supporters assaulted BSP legislators and even tried to storm into Mayawati's room in the UP government's State Guest House way back on June 2, 1995, after she withdrew support from the Mulayam-led SP-BSP coalition government. With the passage of time, the relations worsened as Mayawati continued to believe that SP's attack on the guest house was actually an attempt on her life. After the Yadav family feud culminated in SP's rout in the  , Akhilesh Yadav was often heard expressing his inclination to join hands with the BSP. Now that Mulayam is virtually out of the Akhilesh's scheme of things, Mayawati has chosen to let bygones be bygones. Surely, it is a testing time for Akhilesh who is now clearly in a tight corner. In order to prove that he really meant to combat ""communal forces"", he would have to abdicate his party's claim to the only Rajya Sabha seat available to it. However, there can be no doubt that SP's tactical sacrifice could change the dynamics of the 2019 general elections.",2018-03-05,"Mulayam Singh Yadav,2019 general elections,Akhilesh Yadav,Mayawati",Truth behind why Mayawati is aligning with SP,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mayawati-akhilesh-yadav-uttar-pradesh-assembly-elections-2019-general-elections-mulayam-singh-yadav/story/1/22659.html
497,Rajdeep Sardesai,"Maybe it's the skill of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convert every state election into a ""national"" battle, but never before has an election result to three small states in the Northeast attracted such media attention. So here are my 10 takeaways from the battle for the Northeast, the first big election verdict of 2018. 1) The BJP is by some considerable distance the country's premier national party. It isn't just the fact that the BJP is in power in 21 states, it's just how rapidly they have expanded their geographical footprint. When they came to power at the Centre in 2014, the BJP was in government in just half a dozen states; from there to their present status in the span of just four years is a quite remarkable achievement. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah must take a lot of credit because they have quite clearly reinvented election strategies: a robust 24x7 campaigning style that is relentless and rewarding. There may be just five Lok Sabha seats at stake between Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland, and the results may have no impact on the 2019 general elections or the next big state battle in Karnataka in May, but the BJP's presence in government in all three states gives the Modi-Shah combine the psychological ascendancy once again, a conviction that it remains electorally on a roll (that it has also happened just on the eve of a Parliament session is a side benefit in ensuring clever headline management in the times of Nirav Modi and bank defaults!) 2) Tripura is the ultimate proof of the BJP's formidable election machine, arguably the most effective vote gathering juggernaut in Independent India. To win a state where in the previous election,   is a swing in fortunes that is unprecedented. No single factor is responsible: a focussed leadership, a strong RSS cadre based organisation, artful booth management, plentiful resources, a strategic if risky tie-up with a local tribal outfit, a weakened Congress, a fatigued Left, have all come together to allow the lotus to bloom in Agartala. But above all else, it's the audacity of ambition that is impressive: Who would have thought tiny Tripura would be so firmly on the BJP's radar? In fact, when Amit Shah spoke of the BJP targeting Tripura as a ""growth"" state a few years ago, there was a measure of incredulity in the response even from those within the party; now, he is seen as a modern day Chanakya! That a cadre-based right was able to challenge a cadre-based Left on its home turf and win must make this victory smell particularly sweet. 3) No election is won by individuals alone. The BJP has a ""team"" with Modi as the all powerful general, Shah as his deputy but crucially, enough local level commanders to spearhead the charge.   has proved himself as a man for all seasons from Kashmir to Kohima; Himanta Biswa Sarma is the BJP's Northeast army corps commander and the BJP Tripura in-charge Sunil Deodhar is the anonymous battalion leader who can inspire troops (karyakartas) into a tough battle. Deodhar, like Modi, is a RSS ""pracharak"", the kind of nuts and bolts committed organisation man that the other parties so desperately lack at the moment. Deodhar doesn't want to be Rajya Sabha MP, doesn't want to be a minister, just is an old fashioned political activist who has put party and ideology above self, spending years building the RSS shakha network across the Northeast. 4) The BJP has leveraged its four years at the Centre and two years in power in Assam to build a strong equation with potential allies in the Northeast. The relationship may be transactional at one level and often leveraged through money power (every Northeast government depends on central funding) but by forging a broad North East Democratic alliance, there is a genuine platform which has been created to address grievances. That the PM has himself invested time and personal equity in consciously projecting a ""look/act east"" policy - holding major central government meetings in a Guwahati and Shillong is one step - has helped build a trust quotient that has made it easier to stitch convenient regional alliances. 5) The BJP has also shown the political ""flexibility"" to ""customise"" its agenda to address diverse constituencies. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Asauddin Owaisi was once quoted as saying, ""For the BJP, beef is mummy in Delhi and yummy in the north east."" He wasn't wrong. But what the BJP's rivals will see as duplicity could well be explained as a recognition of a diverse cultural ethos by a party which for the longest time was defined by a ""Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan"" brand of politics. The dissonance may still rear its head in the future but that the BJP has been able to make itself ""acceptable"" in Christian dominated Nagaland and Meghalaya is not without significance. Yes, the BJP won just two seats in Meghalaya and is a marginal party in Nagaland, and has ridden to power by ""deal-making"" with regional parties but there is clearly no ideological isolation or political untouchability of the kind that haunted the BJP in the 1990s. It is interesting that the hill parties of Meghalaya, for example, chose the BJP to form a government with when they had the option of siding with the Congress (even the Sangmas of the BJP's Meghalaya ally NPP were once a Congress family). Nagaland is less of a surprise: Naga parties have traditionally chosen to deal with whoever is in power at the Centre. Of greater concern here is the Nagaland framework agreement signed with Naga militant groups in 2015 but still not made public and whether the agreement will lead to a more durable peace. 6) The Congress, once the dominant force of the Northeast, is now a party in retreat. In 2014, the Congress was in power in five of the states in the region; now, it just has tiny Mizoram to show for itself. What happened in Arunachal was morally indefensible but the Congress leadership did itself no favours by procrastinating in a crisis. In Manipur, a strong local satrap like Ibobi Singh at least offered a challenge. Elsewhere, the party has allowed a familiar rust and decay to set in, symbolic of its overall national health. Tripura is a good example. The BJP made its initial inroads in Tripura primarily because the Congress just evaporated, first taken over by the Trinamool Congress and then the BJP. It's the 36 per cent Congress vote of 2013 that was reduced to single digits in 2018. The party's campaign in Tripura never took off, it contested just 18 seats in Nagaland, and allowed the situation to drift in Meghalaya till it was too late. Its general secretary for the Northeast, CP Joshi, has earned the dubious reputation of being a leader who can snatch defeat from victory if required (the Congress has just split in Bihar, another state which he presides over). Contrast Joshi's lethargy with the raw energy of a Biswa Sarma, the BJP's Assam-based go getting leader. To think that Biswa Sarma was dyed in the wool Congressman till just over two years ago is another reminder of how easily the party has squandered its own talent by choosing not to empower those who may challenge the status quo with their ambition and desire. 7) After its ""moral"" victory in Gujarat and an impressive showing in the Rajasthan by-elections, the Congress leadership convinced itself that it was on the right track to recovery. Rahul Gandhi's ascent to party presidentship was seen as a sign that the first family of the party was back in business. And yet,   in the Northeast only confirm the suspicion that he is still a work in progress, alternately confident and casual, a well-intentioned leader still unable to lead aggressively and consistently from the front. Gandhi only addressed one meeting in Tripura on the last day of the campaign and ignored Nagaland altogether. May be, it was a lost cause in any case but what is the message to the party workers if the leader gives up so easily? Rahul was more assertive in Meghalaya where the party was in the race but here again he might have been better off spending a full week campaigning in the state rather than dashing off to launch his Karnataka campaign, a state where elections are still a few months away. Perhaps, the final proof of Rahul's on-off approach to politics was when he chose to spend the results weekend in Italy with his ""Nani"". Nothing wrong in surprising your grand-ma with a ""hug"", but surely that could have waited till the election results were out. The optics are once again misconceived: this is a week to be hugging your candidates who have won, grandma perhaps can wait! Rahul's supporters may insist that time is on their side, but time waits for no one, and may be running out rapidly ahead of the 2019 general elections. Winning Karnataka (and later in the year, Rajasthan) is make or break for the Congress leadership's immediate political calculations. 8) Like the Congress, the Left too needs to go back to the drawing board. A few months ago, when I suggested to a Left leader in Delhi that the BJP might offer a real challenge in Tripura, I was brushed aside: ""You journalists are easily swayed by Modi-Shah's media blitz. Tripura is not Gujarat!"" Indeed, Tripura was not Gujarat. While in Gujarat, the BJP was able to fight off a 25 year anti-incumbency, in Tripura, a mix of complacency and arrogance meant that winning a sixth election in a row was a bridge too far. Yes,   and we could celebrate his being the country's ""poorest"" CM but he was also ultimately a one man show. Yes, he brought peace and stability to the border state, but peace cannot guarantee jobs. As its Tripura model unravelled, the CPM has chosen to blame the BJP for misusing money power rather than look within. Living in denial won't help the Left: its precipitous decline in neighbouring Bengal is a consequence of this intransigent attitude. With 42 per cent of the vote, the Left still retains a solid core base in Tripura, but its ideology needs to attract the younger voters in particular to remain relevant. 9) As politics gets localised, every state result must be seen in isolation. An impressive BJP triumph in Tripura for example doesn't necessarily mean that the party will make similar strides in Left ruled Kerala or, indeed, in Bengal, the other potential ""growth"" state. But there is growing evidence to suggest that the BJP is rapidly occupying the spaces vacated by the Congress to emerge as a challenger to existing political alignments in states where once the Congress was the premier national force. Expect Odisha to be the more immediate potential ""target"" state in 2019 with Bengal and Kerala also on the radar. And yet, the main challenge for the BJP to remain on top in 2019 is retaining its bastions in north and west India. 10) Personally, the best news for me is the fact that the dramatic rise of the BJP in the Northeast has forced the news media, and TV in particular, to focus on a neglected region. I have often called it the ""tyranny of distance"" but the fact is that the Northeast has been in real danger of falling off the national news map. That it has taken a landmark election result in Tripura to reduce the gap between Agartala and national news headquarters is a positive sign. Hopefully, although I rather doubt it, we will be forced to keep our gaze on the region beyond just another exciting T20 like election counting day! Next stop Karnataka!

498,Vijayaraghavan Narasimhan,"It does not redound positively on the Modi government that the executive is seen to be resisting to accept the recommendation of the Supreme Court collegium to elevate justice KM Joseph. Justice Joseph, as the chief justice of the Uttarakhand High Court, had led the bench that trounced the proclamation of the then president of India to resurrect the Congress state government. The Union of India did not like it and possibly not forgotten it. Reports suggest that citing breach of ""seniority"" the  recommendations sent by the Supreme Court collegium to appoint Uttarakhand High Court chief justice, KM Joseph, as a judge of the apex court, and justice Surya Kant of Punjab and Haryana High Court as chief justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court. Tagging on the candidature of   appears to be a ruse to justify the reluctance of the government to accommodate justice Joseph. Reasons are not far to seek and it would not go down well with those who see the need for institutional integrity in ensuring  independent voices as occupants  on the apex court bench. For the healthy functioning of democracy, there ought to be harmony between the three pillars - the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. While no one institution can be seen to be kowtowing to the other, respect and regard for the role of the other is necessary. Yes, the executive and the legislature are cut up over judicial transgressions into the territory of the other. There are undeniable instances of judicial overreaching seemingly belittling the roles of the other two pillars. But, to the informed, it would appear that it is the failure of the executive and the legislative branches to satisfactorily perform their roles that has led to the inexorable reality of the judiciary being ""constrained"" to fill in the breach.   Yes, the executive and the legislature may be peeved at the usurped right to appoint judges to constitutional courts to the collegium. It was an innovation conceived, introduced and being implemented by the apex court which was not even contemplated by the makers of the Constitution. It was veritable judicial legislation unheard of in the annals of any democratic jurisprudence. But it became  a ""necessary compulsion"" as the executive was seen to be overreaching its domain and not laying store by meaningful ""consultative"" process with the judiciary represented by the chief justice of India.  Judicial appointments were getting ""too political"" in ""committed candidates"" for the nation’s comfort that the Supreme Court in the Second Judges Case in 1993 chose to take charge. Ever since, the other two pillars have been trying to get even with the judiciary. Despite the cleavage in political opinions, the legislators got together, across the aisle to move a constitutional amendment and a legislation in the National Judicial Appointments Commission. Both Houses of Parliament passed the statute unanimously except for the sole dissent of Ram Jethmalani in the Rajya Sabha, toeing his own line. The requisite number of state Assemblies also fell in line and the NJAC became a reality, only to be challenged before the Supreme Court by the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association. From day one of the proceedings, it was evident from what fell from the bench that the NJAC may not pass constitutional muster. The presence of the law minister in the decision-making body of the commission was held to be the ""red rag"" indicative and conclusive of political interference into the sanctified territory of ""independent judiciary"". The rest of the challenge paled into insignificance, and despite the original expectation that the NJAC may after all sail through, since an otherwise divided polity had got together as one, after over two decades of repeated attempts, possibly with a ""reading down"" of the provision relating to the presence of the law minister and ""eminent person"" and making the elective body with an odd number, giving primacy to the vote of the chief justice of India. Alas, it was not be. A 4-1 verdict with justice J Chelameswar alone in dissent meant the NJAC was confined to the dustbin of constitutional history. The executive and the legislature appear to have been side-lined by the judiciary in a unique case of ""judges anointing themselves"" in a precedent of rarity. Arun Jaitley christened that as ""unelected tyranny"". Latching on to the fig leaf on offer to put in place a consensual memorandum of procedure (MoP), the central government seems to be asserting the role of the executive. The MoP has been doing the rounds between the collegium and government, and the final version of March 2017 is lying unresponded to by the executive. Incidentally, this issue was also flagged of by four of the senior-most judges when they went public on the roster control of the chief justice of India. By convention, when the collegium reiterates its view, when sent back by the executive, it shall prevail. This is akin to the constitutional position when the cabinet seeks the nod of the president of India, and the president returns the matter for the cabinet to reconsider. If the cabinet sticks to its recommendation, the president shall have to fall in line (Article 74 (1) of Constitution). It was a healthy convention, which the collegium recommendations also assumed, with the top court imprimatur. It may do a world of good to the Modi dispensation to yield to the collegium recommendation for justice Joseph, whose credentials are otherwise with not a speck of doubt. In citing seniority as the basis for blocking, the executive appears to be inventing excuses for its political decision. Not a healthy precedent to set, for sure.",2018-03-03,"Centre,Judiciary,Collegium,Supreme Court",Why Centre blocking nomination of two judges to SC collegium sets a bad precedent,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-centre-tussle-blocks-nomination-judges-sc-collegium-modi-government/story/1/22640.html
499,Amit Sengupta,"For those who were closely watching the border state of Tripura in the Northeast, despite the impeccable credentials of a rare chief minister like  , the Assembly results seemed like a foregone conclusion. Indeed, even die-hard optimists gave the CPM a thin margin, perhaps, a neck-and-neck chance, considering the organised rise of the BJP and the RSS in Tripura, with full money power, hyperbolic promises and loaded with central resources. Plus, there was the inter-play of complex factors that underlined the politics and social demography of this tiny ""peaceful state"" in close proximity with Bangladesh. Peaceful - for more reasons than one. For four decades and more, the CPM ruled the state, and for many, it was the sober and simple personality of Manik Sarkar which shined in the green landscape. Sarkar gave away his entire salary to the party, lived on Rs 2,000 plus per month given by the party, with a tiffin of puffed rice, apparently his favourite, had a bank balance of less than Rs 2,000, just a fraction of a little land on the outskirts of capital Agartala shared with his sister, no car, no property, no email account, not even a mobile. He was certainly a stoic, classical communist, and Tripura seemed proud of him, even while the party bosses in Delhi, Kerala and Kolkata, never really thought it important to showcase him in the national stage. His wife, Panchali Bhattacharya, a retired government official, travelled on rickshaw and public transport, and was as stoic and classical a communist as her husband. There are other reasons as well, as to why it took so long for anti-incumbency and the rise of Hindutva to outsmart Sarkar’s regime. He effectively restored peace and communal harmony in a state infested with violent insurgency and cross-border terrorism and strife. He was the first to abolish the draconian   (AFSPA), unite the Bengalis and the tribals, stop the forces of separatism (now aligned with the BJP), clean up the system, raise literacy to almost 90 per cent, eliminate poverty and malnutrition in large areas, push for women’s empowerment as a policy on the ground, restore law and order, give tribals their traditional rights. He also blocked hate politics which seemed to have stalked other parts of the country, especially the Hindi heartland, since the arrival of the BJP’s majority regime in Delhi since 2014. Literacy and unemployment, though, went hand-in-hand, due to lack of infrastructure, investment and industry; but, Sarkar would nonchalantly respond that this has been a national phenomena since the new regime in Delhi has failed in all its promises, and a direct fallout of demonetisation as well. So why blame only tiny Tripura? However, to come face to face with the bitter realism of the contemporary scenario, the BJP has risen for the following complex electoral and social factors: Ruling for 25 years with impeccable honesty is just not enough for the modern electorate, especially the aspiring educated classes, high on the flip-side of globalisation and liberalisation, and low on history, philosophy or social sciences. The downward filter theory has not really worked in India, but it is still an eternally seductive and addictive lollypop - hanging like ""lucy in the sky with diamonds"". Anti-incumbency is the primary reason for the loss of Sarkar’s  government, even  while the Opposition, namely the Congress and a section of the Trinamool Congress have been decimated, coopted, sidelined, subverted or bought over, most of it willfully, with the Congress high command in Delhi, head safely in the sand, refusing to see the writing on the wall. The Congress in-charge of Tripura, CP Joshi, reportedly, visited it only once, while   displayed little interest. Most elected representatives of these parties went over to the BJP, so that many seem to have only voted for the old Congress in a new saffron avatar. The tribal-Bengali conflict has been simmering for decades, and it goes to the credit of Sarkar, who reconciled the difficult layers of inherited differences. While a large chunk of Bengali voters have been aligned with the Congress, the tribals, with their indigenous rights ushered in by the Left regime, chose to go with the CPM. The separatist and militant Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPTF), which got zero votes in the last Assembly polls in 2013, has won eight out the nine it contested, thereby clearly implying that the tribal vote base along with a large chunk of the Bengali vote base has shifted away from the Left to the separatists and the BJP. Almost the entire Congress voter base has gone over to the BJP. According to unconfirmed reports, the CPM has scored around 47 per cent votes, still the largest share. The BJP, with 42 per cent and the IPTF, with 8 per cent, has scored a combined tally of 50 per cent. Indeed, for the BJP, it is still a risky proposition, combining the Bengali vote base with the militant tribal separatism. This can crack anytime, or create sharp fissures. Time will tell how it will play its dangerous Hindutva card in this edgy scenario in a strategically located state. What is significant in Tripura, as in West Bengal, is that there is an eternal and incipient communal current in the mainstream Bengali population. How the Congress in the past, in the  absence of Hindutva forces, was able to use this current, and yet failed to topple a stagnating CPM, remains a mystery. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee has outclassed the Left by appropriating all the inherited intellectual symbols of the Bengali heritage: from Rabindranath Tagore, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, to Ramkrishna Paramhansa, Vivekananda, Rani Rashmoni, you name it. Even Satyajit Ray and megastar Uttam Kumar’s photogenic memories, along with the other legends, are carved all across Kolkata, adorned with Mamata’s picture - making her the proud inheritor of a great legacy. Red flags or Left wall graffiti seem to have vanished in Kolkata, where local clubs, once CPM bastions, have been taken over by Trinamool, while rural Bengal, where the CPM did land reforms and entrenched its extra-constitutional, often, lumpen base, has opportunistically shifted to the  ruling regime. The BJP, despite coming second in some bypolls in Bengal, can’t even plant its flag in large parts of rural Bengal. Indeed, observers believe that the Tripura result might polarise the communal dimension among certain sections of sectarian Bengalis, especially in the middle class, and in border areas. The chanting of ""Jai Sri Ram"", communal polarisation, and the rise of Hindutva was marked since 2014 in Tripura when the RSS took over the shakhas and injected new dynamism to its politics in the border - with the eternal phobia of the Bangladeshi Muslim factor being played to the hilt.   Sarkar’s popularity or honesty, however, could not hide occasional cases of corruption, faulty implementation of grassroots programmes, the weakening of the Left’s organisational structure, and some of the Left leaders choosing not to be so die-hard honest as their chief minister. Finally, Sarkar has to pay the price. The irony is that when Prakash Karat became general secretary of the CPM, he declared that they will enter the Hindi heartland. From UPA 1 in 2004, the 60 united Left numbers in the Lok Sabha have been reduced to about 10 in the current Lok Sabha. The CPM has been finished in Bengal, defeated decisively in Tripura. While the   line plays out in full glare, the fall and fall of the Left in contemporary India is as transparent as the old Marxist prophecy: history repeats itself, first as a farce, then, as tragedy, and a nightmare.",2018-03-03,"CPM,BJP,Manik sarkar,Tripura Assembly elections 2018",Why Manik Sarkar failed to stop BJP's win in Tripura Assembly elections,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tripura-assembly-election-results-manik-sarkar-cpm-bjp-rss-hindutva-bengalis-congress/story/1/22642.html
500,Nikhil Wagle,"In September 1995, a bizarre news story made headlines. The idol of lord Ganesha was apparently drinking milk, and the entire country was talking about it. The media had particularly gone berserk. While most journalists sought comments from politicians or scientists, Surendra Pratap Singh, who used to edit and anchor “Aaj Tak” - a news bulletin on Doordarshan that later culminated into a news channel - sent his reporter to a cobbler. He simplified the capillary action and explained it beautifully to the viewers. As I watched, or rather read about, the crass media coverage of  death, I missed my friend SP Singh, more than ever. Unfortunately, SP passed away prematurely. News channels, including the one he founded, would have been better off with his perspective that was so palpably missing. Because that's the purpose an editor is supposed to serve - to put developments in perspective, irrespective of the TRPs. In the quest to “break news”, channels did not follow any of the basic rules of cross-verification. And what followed after that was sheer black comedy. Deep discussions ranging from whether an excellent dancer could fall in a bathtub to whether India has a “bathtub culture” with images of drowning Sridevi with Boney Kapoor watching along to enhance our experience. A South Indian reporter went a step further and literally entered a bathtub, leaving behind all the English and Hindi channels. Amid the madness, how could BJP MP Subramanian Swamy keep mum? He demanded an inquiry between Dawood Ibrahim and the Hindi film industry, suggesting foul play. Like a postman, ANI passed it on to news channels without countering him, and the news channels carried it. I am neither shocked nor surprised. Private news channels have been on the rise since 2000. And incidents like Sridevi's would be found in abundance if we peep into the recent history of these channels. Take the example of little   who fell into a well, or even the   case. A few weeks back when the news media was consumed with  , some of the reporters had donned Padmavati's costume to present news. Why should this be called ""journalism"" is a million-dollar question. When commentators or media critics point out the nonsense disguised as journalism, an easy excuse of TRP is thrown back at the critics. While the viewers, to whom I will come later in the piece, are responsible for abetting the sorry state of journalism, the primary responsibility lies with the editors. Journalism cannot always be viewer-driven. There is no denying the viewership generates revenues and is essential for the sustenance of channels, but not at the cost of journalistic integrity. If the owners insist on TRP-driven programmes, shouldn't the editors stand up to them? Why cannot they have faith in themselves to engage the viewers with good content? I headed a news channel for seven years, which was watched and embraced by the state of Maharashtra. Not once the management knocked on my doors to pressurise me for TRP-driven programmes because we provided content. I sent my reporters to the field, instead of bathtubs. Editors today have become lazy. They do not want to work hard for numbers. But in the conquest of cheap success, they have sacrificed good journalism. They have reduced journalism to a platform for cheap entertainment. The most unfortunate part is it is not happening out of lack of skill, but lack of conscience. When you head a TV channel, you have a certain responsibility towards the society. And when people in positions of power start selling their souls, it seeps into the society as well. Indian journalism has rich history right from the time of   inspired Raja Ram Mohan Roy. The legacy continued through the freedom struggle and thereafter as well. But in the last decades or so, the entire legacy has been shredded into pieces. There is nothing wrong in aspiring to be the most-viewed channel. But as I said earlier, it cannot be achieved through shortcuts. Simply echoing the “public sentiment” is not journalism. And the guests participating in it, validate and legitimise the circus. Which brings me to the viewers, who are as culpable here. I was in Mumbai and Nasik the day after Sridevi passed away. Not a single household I stepped into had anything other than Sridevi on their TVs. The channels discussing it insensitively and the viewers watching it with equal voyeurism. It is a fact that the channels feasting on Sridevi's death are the ones that are most watched. Viewers enable editors to be mediocre, and vice versa. We have been caught in a vicious circle. The question is, how long will this blame game continue? Will the viewers stop watching these channels? Will the editors think of journalism first and TRPs later? The need to look inwards is starker than ever, because it wasn’t just Sridevi's funeral that took place on Wednesday. Journalist Barkha Dutt aptly came up with the hashtag “ ”. And all of us provided a shoulder to it.",2018-03-03,"Trp,Bollywood,Indian media,Sridevi death",Who is responsible for 'news ki maut'?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sridevi-death-media-coverage-voyeurism-bollywood-tv-news-channels-trp/story/1/22644.html
501,David Frawley,"In retrospect, the biggest political news of 2017 in India was the landslide BJP win in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous in India, followed by Yogi Adityanath taking over as the new chief minister. The magnitude of this victory was unexpected and sent shockwaves throughout the country, compounded by the fact that a saffron monk was chosen to lead the state. The Congress could not even hold on to the Gandhi  . The UP event was augmented by the BJP to Bihar alliance government, as Nitish Kumar abandoned Lalu Prasad's RJD that was steering the state back towards crime and corruption. The recent additional convictions of Lalu and the investigations into his family show the wisdom of this move by Nitish. The result is that the main Hindu heartland of UP and Bihar is now under BJP or saffron rule and a unitary Hindu vote is emerging in areas in which  had previously prevailed. This Hindu vote, however, is not a mere religious assertion or promotion of religious intolerance, as some would say, but an awakening of Indians to their cultural unity and ancient heritage. The so-called Hindu nationalism is not a regressive tendency, but an aspirational move to a new India much as PM Narendra Modi has noted, which honours the great dharmic civilisation of the region and aims at sustaining its continuity. This is different from the Nehruvian India that was more an imitation of failed Western socialist states than anything Indian or dharmic. The UP poll marked the removal of the Nehruvian shadow from the centre of the country. The more recent Gujarat election has been emphasised as a Congress revival, mainly because the BJP did not win through a landslide margin, not because Congress actually won. That losing an election less badly is promoted as positive news for the Congress only shows how far the party has fallen from power. The fact is at the end of the year, the BJP is governing a great majority of states in India and Congress-ruled states are a mere footnote. The Gujarat election was conducted in the shadow of the UP election. Rahul Gandhi ran as the newly appointed (one cannot accurately say elected) Congress president. Though Rahul had not previously showed any interest in Hindu temples, much less overtly supporting any Hindu causes - he went on an extensive political temple tour, visiting more than 20 temples in Gujarat. More notably, he suddenly called himself a thread wearing Brahmin Hindu, strange for one who was long happy to live quietly in the shadow of a Christian mother as if he were a Christian himself. No other leader in the Nehru/Gandhi dynasty has ever made such a clear statement of Hindu identity, not even Indira Gandhi who regularly visited Hindu gurus. Yet, it is not devotion to Hinduism but political necessity that seems to have motivated his statement. The Congress has not given up its old anti-Hindu policies in this overt change to a  . It continues its old policy of dividing Hindus through caste with new vigour. The Congress attempted this in Gujarat as well. Similarly, Congress leaders in Karnataka are trying to divide Hindus on the basis of religious practices, supporting Veera Shaivites as non-Hindus. Meanwhile, Rahul and Congress continue stoking leftist sentiments, allying themselves with communist parties and student unions like those of Jawaharlal Nehru University. Rahul only displays his Hindu appearance when required. Otherwise he is happy to be part of the far-left and support anti-Hindu agendas, particularly hatred for Brahmins. Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal is now following the same strategy. Can such old strident anti-Hindu leaders draw enough of the Hindu vote in order to stay in power, without changing their anti-Hindu policies? That is the question. Can they get the voters to forget their charges of saffron terrorism and their excusing of jihadi activities? Over these issues looms the shadow of UP and with it the issue of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. So far, the Congress has not changed its stand on the   and Rahul has not made any statements on whether the party is still opposed to building the temple and laments the loss of Babri Masjid. The problem for the Congress is that its leaders have long provided legal support for those against the temple, and long castigated Hindus who support the Ram Mandir as communal, anti-secular, if not fascist. On Ayodhya, the party continues to follow anti-Hindu policies of the communists and leftists. A reversal on this issue would be difficult to explain, yet without it any Hindu support for the Congress remains doubtful. Meanwhile, PM Modi remains committed to promoting Indian interests globally and expanding development inside the country as well. The main problem he has to face is that the entrenched Congress ecosystem in the Rajya Sabha, courts and bureaucracy continue to resist change and improvement, particularly now that their graft and black money sources have been cut off. The Congress is promoting a hate Modi campaign, and trying to create as much confusion and mayhem as it can in society. Apart from its few pro-Hindu gestures, the Congress is now looking more like a new version of the Aam Aadmi Party with Rahul Gandhi as the new Arvind Kejriwal, promoting anarchy in the name of resisting oppression. The stature of Modi continues to tower over such immature attempts at political disruption and will likely dominate the future. But expect a year of political theatre, shifting and contradictory views, with anti-Modi stunts and antics covering over a lack of policy or leadership by the Opposition. The Hindu card will be used to capitalise on all sorts of social divisions and consistent attempts to create confusion and disruptions will be made. Yet it is likely that the ""new Congress"" will meet the same fate as the AAP.

502,Rajeev Sharma,"The beleaguered government of Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen Gayoom, which has been moving from one crisis to another, has now been given a body blow as health minister Dunya Maumoon resigned from her post, second minister to do so since the imposition of Emergency on February 5. She was apparently feeling suffocated and frustrated with the Yameen government particularly since her father, Maumoon Gayoom, a former president who ruled Maldives for over three decades, was arrested recently on orders of his half-brother President Abdulla Yameen on criminal charges.   
 
 Though  has said in her resignation letter that she hasn't joined the Opposition, the development is bound to bolster the Opposition which has been at its wits’ end in dealing with the increasingly autocratic President Abdulla Yameen. Despite her caveat of not joining the Opposition, she has expressed concern about the state of democracy, judiciary and institutions and called upon the international community to help getting all these back on rails. 
 
 This has been the consistent demand of the Maldivian Opposition for quite some time. Obviously, it means that the Opposition has got a shot in the arm and Dunya is firmly in the Opposition camp despite her feeble caveats to the contrary. Dunya Maumoon’s resignation came hours after it surfaced that India had offered to Maldives to participate in the  , to be held in Port Blair early next month, but the Maldives government declined the offer - a clear snub to India by Maldives ostensibly at the behest of China. Although Maldivian authorities have ""explained"" to India that under the current circumstances when the island nation has been under a state of emergency, it wasn't possible for Maldives to participate in the naval exercises as the Maldivian defence forces were on a standby to deal with any exigency. The Maldivian government’s rejection of the Indian offer to join the Milan exercises is being looked upon in the Indian strategic establishment as the Yameen government’s latest snub to India. It has been quite clear in the past few months that Maldives has flown out of the Indian orbit and flown into the Chinese sphere instead. It was demonstrated a few months ago when Maldives had signed its first-ever FTA with China, leaving India high and dry despite the Yameen government’s repeated assurances to New Delhi about its India-first policy. Maldives’ rapid drifting away from India and its China embrace came into sharp focus once again after news reports emerged in the Indian media that China was at the cusp of getting a military base in Maldives by way of Beijing establishing a joint ocean observation station in Maldives’ Makunudhoo, which is not very far from India. India, though seething with anger over the recent developments in Maldives, cannot do much to reverse the tide under the current circumstances. An Indian military intervention, sought by Opposition leader and former Maldivian president Mohammed Nasheed, is out of question. It's not just because of Chinese warnings, but essentially because of well-established principles of Indian foreign policy of not intervening in domestic affairs of a foreign power unless a specific request is made by the government of the troubled country. Moreover, since the nightmarish experience of Indian intervention in Sri Lanka when the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi sent Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to Sri Lanka, it has been the unwritten principle of India not to embark on military missions abroad. Under the circumstances, the only doable option before India is to work through the United Nations route. In this context, the following initiative of an international body bells with the Indian scheme of things.  , the law association for Asia and the Pacific comprising of national bar associations and law societies in the United Nations ESCAP Region, has just decided to establish a fact-finding team for the purpose of ascertaining the situation with regard to: 1) The independence of the judiciary in Maldives 2) The independence of the Judicial Services Commission, and the transparency of  the process for appointment of judges and investigations of complaints regarding judicial conduct 3) The independence of the legal profession, and whether members of the legal profession are able to perform their professional duties unhindered and free of harassment or intimidation 4) Due process in the administration of justice in the Republic of Maldives 5) The rule of law and rights-related issues. The LAWASIA fact-finding team, led by its president Christopher Leong, is an independent team with an objective mission which is not to be sponsored by any parties, organisations or individuals from Maldives. This initiative is in response to the Maldivian foreign ministry's February 7 statement which said: “Maldives would like to invite its development partners and representatives from international organisations and associations to visit Maldives to assess the situation and witness the safety and security of Male, for their own citizens as well as to engage with the Government and key stakeholders in the country.” India will be backing the LAWASIA Initiative to the hilt, knowing full well that initiatives like these can bring more fruits quickly than the efforts of the marginalised Opposition.",2018-02-28,"Abdulla Yameen Gayoom,Milan naval exercises,India,Maldives",Why deepening Maldives crisis should worry India,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/maldives-india-snub-milan-naval-exercises-abdulla-yameen-gayoom-dunya-maumoon/story/1/22604.html
503,Praveen Shekhar,"A meeting of the  that was held in Paris concluded on February 23. During a plenary session of the FATF meet it was decided that Pakistan should be put on the ""grey list"" again to keep a watch on the rogue nation for not complying with the norms to check financing of terrorism. Over the next four months, Pakistan is expected to comply with certain stipulated conditions failing which it will find mention in FATF's formal statement. The neighbouring country was on the watch-list between 2012 and 2015 but only for money laundering. This time, however, Pakistan will be monitored for its compliance with anti-money laundering and Combating Finance of Terrorism regulations. FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989. Its objectives are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering,   and other threats to the international financial system. The Unites States worked behind the scenes during the Paris meet to ensure action against Islamabad, which Washington believes has not kept its promises on combating terrorism. All 39 member countries of FATF, barring Turkey, supported the US proposal against Pakistan. Even Pakistan's allies - China and Saudi Arabia - withdrew their objection to the move for punitive action. 
 
 The decision at FATF has sent out an encouraging signal. The message that had gone out it that even if some countries do not see eye to eye on certain issues, combating terrorism was a common cause. This is the first time that China has supported India's stand and not backed Pakistan at a global anti-terror forum, thus landing a crippling blow to Islamabad's financial credentials. India is high on hope after China isolated Pakistan on the issue of terrorism. However, India does not need to be over ecstatic about the development. The reason is simple. China's stand at the FATF meet was backed by its own considerations. Remember, China is itself a victim of terrorism in the Xinjiang province. Today, if China doesn't join the global fight against terror, it may find itself isolated in tackling the menace on its own territory in the future. Also, China's brotherly love for Pakistan hasn't waned. The signs of this love are not just reflected in the Chinese investments in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the One Belt One Road Initiative. It goes much beyond that. Being on the grey list would mean that Pakistan's transactions are closely monitored. This would further cripple the country's economy as companies across the world would hesitate from doing business with Pakistan. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank too would avoid giving loans to Pakistan. In January, US President Donald Trump publicly raised concerns over Pakistan's reliability and integrity. His first tweet of 2018 put Islamabad in the cross hairs for its ""lies and deceit"". And on January 8, the US   to Pakistan over what it saw as a failure by the Pakistani government to adequately clamp down on terror groups within its borders. Every time pressure to act against terror is increased, Pakistan tries to rein in on terrorist organisations operating along its borders with Afghanistan, but it continues to target India. This pressure on Pakistan should continue till it changes its attitude and stop providing safe heavens to terrorists on its soil uniformly.",2018-02-28,"China,Terror financing,FATF,Pakistan",Why Pakistan on FATF list is no reason for India to rejoice,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pakistan-fatf-terror-financing-china-india-pakistan-ties-donald-trump/story/1/22603.html
504,Gautam Benegal,"The first page of the website of   - a project of the RSS’s health wing Arogya Bharati that is now providing parents with a kit that includes 10 CDs and books with mantras from ancient Indian texts to be used by expecting mothers - welcomes us with the following words: “Garbha Sanskar is not a new concept in India. Today, science has proved that intrauterine baby cannot only listen, touch, feel but also can respond on its own. More than 60 per cent intellectual development occurs in intrauterine phase. Garbhasanskar - are special scientific procedures performed to stimulate baby’s senses genteelly, because during intrauterine phase, cortical development is maximum. Health, body built, Intellect, talent all depends upon mother’s prenatal care. Mind, body and intelligence are synchronised and these have special value in life.” This reasonable scientific elucidation soon segues into the area of pseudoscience which the RSS is notorious for. (And out goes the grammar too as it warms to its theme.) “You can invite divine souls to take birth as transition phase is going on. Spiritually during this time, all the divine souls are keen to take birth. Divine souls come with good learning to perform good acts in this world. Hence, are constantly looking for the right parents, perfect environment where they are groomed in such a manner so that they can continue with their noble work which may be purpose of re-birth.” Therefore, the couple has to increase the good karmic level to such an extent that the divine soul chooses it to be its parents. Since all this is possible only during the pregnancy phase which we strongly believe is one of the most important, precious and delicate phase in the lifetime of any mother. People who follow our most advanced garbh sanskar antenatal classes sincerely get desirable results.” Among others, the Jamnagar-based centre has what they describe as “medical astrologers, yoga and music experts” in their team of consultants. Says the kendra’s manager, Rekha Gaur. “Every parent wants to have a good quality baby. Parents want their child to be bright and smart. But how can that be achieved? The answer lies in our sanskriti (culture) and values… If the parents want their child to be like Shivaji Maharaj, Rana Pratap or Aryabhata, then they will be provided with necessary suggestions. There is a whole range of sanskar prakriya (ritualistic procedure). There are different procedures if someone wishes to have a fair and tall baby or a smart and intelligent baby.” The RSS' love for a race which is of “fair” complexion is part of its ideological heritage that Indians are Aryans; fair, tall, honourable, respectable and noble who speak Sanskrit. RSS stands for Aryan supremacy and believes that only Hindu Brahmins of north India are from that stock. The most prominent ideologue of RSS, Guru Golwalkar, while addressing a gathering of faculty and students of the School of Social Science of Gujarat University on December 17, 1960, shared the wisdom that Namboodri Brahmins from north India were sent to Kerala to improve breed of Hindus there. According to him: “Today experiments in cross-breeding are made only on animals. But the courage to make such experiments on human beings is not shown even by the so-called modern scientists of today. If some human crossbreeding is seen today it is the result not of scientific experiments but of carnal lust. Now, let us see the experiments our ancestors made in this sphere. In an effort to better the human species through cross-breeding the Namboodri Brahamanas of the north were settled in Kerala and a rule was laid down that the eldest son of a Namboodri family could marry only the daughter of Vaishya, Kashtriya or Shudra communities of Kerala. Another still more courageous rule was that the first off-spring of a married woman of any class must be fathered by a Namboodri Brahman and then she could beget children by her husband.” The RSS' belief of Aryan superiority has been borrowed from Hitler and his Nazi Party of Germany. Adolf Hitler even before becoming chancellor of Germany was obsessed with ideas about race. He believed in racial “purity” and in the superiority of the “Germanic race” which he described as Aryan “master race.” He declared this Aryan race must remain pure in order to rule the world one day which was not far away. According to Hitler, the ideal “Aryan” was blond, blue-eyed, and tall. According to Dr Hitesh Jani, convenor of Arogya Bharati, another offshoot of RSS which is part of the project, “If the proper procedure is followed, babies of dark-skinned parents with lesser height can have fair complexion and grow taller”. When Golwalkar’s fascination with Hitler came up  for discussion in the Rajya Sabha on May 6, 2002,  the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee dismissed Golwalkar's openly fascist views as ""his own ( )'' and added that the BJP had ""nothing to do with the book (   )'' and that his party ""had never given its stamp of approval  nahin lagayi)"", which was, of course, as untruthful as the undertaking of the RSS to Sardar Patel that it would remain a ""social organisation"". Yet Golwalkar’s “apne vichar” keeps coming back like a bad penny, and this time around with government collusion. The next counselling sessions to create Übermensch Hindus like the Nazi Lebensborn project, are slated to be held in Kolkata, Rohtak and Gurgaon. The RSS has set a target by 2020 to have thousands of ideal infants on the production line. So, what are these ancient and venerable texts that will have little Rana Prataps and Shivajis gamboling around our Elysian fields of the future? Here’s an example from the Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad in its fourth section which describes the Putramanthanamantra rites by which a house-holder can get a worthy son or a worthy daughter. ( verse 6-4-17) If the husband and wife wish that a daughter should be born and that she should be learned and live full term of life, they should prepare rice cooked in sesame and they should eat with clarified butter. Then they will fulfil their desire."" Here’s a passage from the Ayurvedic astrological conception chart calculation: “The lagna of the conception chart is the seventh from the child’s janma lagna. That which was the seventh house of the conception chart becomes the lagna [or navamsha lagna] of the individual. There is a great revelation hidden in this technique. The seventh house of the conception chart shows the mental and emotional qualities between the parents at the moment of creating the individual. This seventh house sign then becomes the rashi or navamsha lagna of the individual’s birth chart. In this way, the guna (levels of rajas and tamas) and doshas (levels of the elements) of the parents dominant at the time of conception influences the nature of the child as stated in the Ayurveda texts.” There’s a lot more which will make any 21  century educated person’s toes curl in embarrassment. But the irony of the passage recommending the ideal conditions in which to conceive the sonnenkinder boy child is unmistakable, given the zealous Hindutva drive against non-vegetarian, and specifically beef.   (verse 6-4-18) Those who aspire for a son should be born to them, who should be a reputed scholar, who should be frequenting the assemblies of learned scholars, who would be speaking delightful and valuable words, who will be a master of all the Vedas and who will live a long life, then both husband and wife should eat with clarified butter meat of a young bull or of a bull advanced in years. Then they will succeed in their ambition.""",2018-02-24,"Hindutva,Arogya Bharati,Garbhvigyan Anusandhan Kendra,RSS",Why RSS has intensified its drive to create babies with 'Aryabhata's brain' and 'Shivaji Maharaj’s build',https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rss-garbhvigyan-anusandhan-kendra-seminar-kit-10-cds-arogya-bharati-hindutva-nazism/story/1/22529.html
505,Kamal Mitra Chenoy,"Ever since 2013, the   (AAP) has been, as far as the political class is concerned, the new kid on the block. Its initial success in 2013 was seen as a voters' lapse, a bad judgement of the electorate which should have chosen the more experienced and settled political parties like the Congress and the BJP. This triangular contest has continued since then. The   just can’t accept the AAP style of politics. The systematic building of mohalla clinics, linking these clinics to hospitals, the revamping of government schools, a host of measures for the poor, including free and cheap potable water, subsidised electricity, more systematic mosquito eradication, anti-drug campaigns and a host of other measures. The mainstream parties despite their longevity failed to seize the potential of these and other measures. They and the Delhi administration took the opportunity of AAP not having a stable majority in the Delhi Assembly to postpone the Assembly elections towards the end of 2015. Despite this gambit, the AAP came to power with 67 Assembly seats out of 70 - with the BJP getting only three seats and the Congress none. This, the Opposition found horrible. Triangular politics became even more vicious and outlandish. The established political class’s dictum became ""when in doubt attack the AAP"". This vitriol was poured against the AAP because in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 in Varanasi, where Narendra Modi was the candidate, the AAP came second and the Congress a poor third. The AAP had become a threat to the political establishment. After this, the anti-AAP campaign became a torrent of abuse, slander, administrative intervention and even extra-judicial attacks on the AAP. Arvind Kejriwal was pilloried for staging a dharna near the Republic Day parade. Didn’t Mahatma Gandhi stop the collection of precious salt at the end of the Dandi March? Didn’t he intervene, or near, into a host of events in South Africa and India? Did anyone, excluding the Sangh Parivar, claim that what he was doing was anti-national? And did Kejriwal actually disrupt Republic Day celebrations? Clearly, Kejriwal’s stated intention was to demonstrate without disruption. But the mass of the media never forgave him. It is instructive to remember that, unlike the Press Council, the electronic media is virtually uncontrolled, or to put it differently, carefully primed to attack forces inimical to the interests of the media channels and their owners. In the past few days, on an “attack” channel, I heard the participants, including the anchor, referring to Kejriwal as a “Maovadi” and a ""Talibani"". My objections were heeded in the first case, but ignored in the second. Tragically, the media believes that anything goes, if it suits the interests of the channel, its owners and supporters. Thus, the term “fake” news. The role of the police cannot be understated. After the confusion and altercation with the  , the Delhi Police searched Kejriwal’s residence. Could it have done so in the case of a Union minister? The CM is the head of the Delhi government. Unfortunately, this has become commonplace. For example, after a political debate in JNU in February 2016, three students, including Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya were arrested and accused of treason. The courts threw the case out. But even after two years, the chargesheet against these students has not been submitted. Or when months later, Kanhaiya was beaten up by lawyers in the presence of the police, police commissioner BS Bassi denied any violence. But the doctors of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital found injuries on Kanhaiya’s body. This is what politicians have done to the police - the politicisation of the police, generally at the behest of politicians and powerful interests. The several police actions against the AAP and idealistic students and youth, obviously goes against the grain of the ideals of the freedom struggle, and the Constitution. This is what the major political parties and vested interests have come to. Will matters improve when passions cool? Highly likely. The mixture of political partisanship, an attack-media, a hostile Union government, an administration under pressure, are not matters and influences that can just wither away. But it should be remembered that administrators also work under difficult circumstances. Kejriwal will remember how a senior IAS officer advising him was picked up by the Delhi Police. Different actions for different people. The AAP has a tough ask. But he and the AAP have faced many challenges. They are here to stay, backed by a huge mass of supporters.",2018-02-24,"Arvind Kejriwal,Chief secretary,Delhi Government,AAP",Why India's political elite can't accept AAP's grassroots politics,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-arvind-kejriwal-maovadi-delhi-chief-secretary-anshu-prakash-bjp-congress-police/story/1/22527.html
506,Seema Guha,"China and India the two major Asian powers have a complex relationship.   has already arrived on the world stage as a major economic and military power bent on reshaping the world its way. India is equally ambitious but as a chaotic democracy, it has not matched China's economic or military might. India knows that as a big populous nation it too has the potential to be a future global power. What is more, the US, concerned about Chinese dominance is willing to help India's growth to balance the regions power equation. The strategy to balance China by giving India a leg-up began during the George W Bush administration and is now being rigorously backed by President Donald Trump. However unlike India, Chinese planning is long-term. Beijing thinks through and meticulously plans its goals. Before embarking on its ambitious foreign policy goals, Deng Xiaoping the great reformer concentrated on the economy. China also settled all its boundary disputes with its neighbours, with the notable exception of India. Deng famously advised his people, to keep their heads down and work towards lifting the living standards of the Chinese. Having done that, China is now ready to take on the world under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, one of China's most powerful leaders. The nineteenth Congress of the CPC (Communist Party of China) was a coming out party for Xi Jinping's China. It is now the second-largest economy in the world. It is also a military power with a blue water navy. It is spending billions on research concentrating on artificial intelligence, gearing the nation to be at the forefront of cutting edge technology. Chinese submarines and ships are present both in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. President Xi Jinping is consolidating and building on Deng Xiaoping's vision of opening up China to the world. While it is expanding its presence across Asia and Africa, (it also has a military base in Djibouti, east Africa), China is looking at being the number one power in the world. It is still far from closing the gap with the US, and knows on its way to become a super power it needs to first dominate Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. So the hectic activity in the South China Sea and expansion into the Indian Ocean sphere. China is also now playing hardball in India's immediate neighbourhood. Xi's ambitious belt and road and maritime initiatives is part of a larger plan to spread its influence across the globe. It is but natural that India and China, the two Asian neighbours eye each other's development warily and ""circle"" each other's periphery. The unresolved border problem between India and China, and PLA's frequent incursions, including the recent   as well as its heavy presence in India's immediate neighbourhood has added to the fear of China pushing into India's sphere of influence. India too has been stepping up its ties with Japan as well as all ASEAN countries. In fact, this Republic Day leaders of all 10 ASEAN nations - Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Philippines, Laos and Cambodia accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to be in Delhi to celebrate not just India's Republic Day but also to mark 25-years of India-ASEAN dialogue partnership. The ASEAN group, which has thriving trade with China, is still wary of Beijing and wants India to play a greater role in the region. ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei also have problems with China's claim to the entire South China Sea and the islands dotted across the waters as its own. But China's footprints are much larger in India's backyard. In the past, Pakistan was the only South Asian nation which had close ties with China. But now China has won not just a toe-hold but a foothold in several countries in India's neighbourhood. Pakistan is now a central piece of China's belt and road project. Beijing is investing $60 billion in developing infrastructure around Gwadar, a port China built in Pakistan's Balochistan province. China has already begun using Gwadar for its exports and is likely to deploy a contingent of the PLA to guard its interests there. In Nepal too, China is becoming a pivotal force. Like all small nations, India's neighbours have often used the China card against India. Nepal's new  , known to be close to China,   after the elections: ""We have great connectivity with India and an open border.., but we can't forget that we have two neighbours. We don't want to depend on one country or have one option."" He explained that Nepal needed this to get leverage in dealing with India. India's foolish decision in 2015 of an unofficial blockade in Nepal, following a Madhesi agitation, soured ties between the two countries. While a pro-India government with Oli at the head is in power in Kathmandu, a China friendly leader is also in place in the Maldives. In Male, President Abdulla Yameen has cracked down on democracy, thrown opposition leaders in jail, and declared an emergency. While India, The US, the UK Britain and the rest of the world have condemned Yameen, China has lent support. It has also warned India against interference in the neighbour's politics. Maldives has signed a Free Trade Agreement in December 2017 with China and has invested hugely in building infrastructure. Chinese vessels regularly stop in the Maldives raising fears of a strong naval presence there. Whether in Sri Lanka, or Myanmar or even Bangladesh, China is present all along India's neighbourhood and beyond. Border talks between Bhutan and China, long in cold storage will begin now, perhaps with Doklam in mind. China is slush with funds and India cannot match its efficient infrastructure building. Delhi should concentrate on its strengths, which is institution building. Repeating its good work in Afghanistan, it should go for smaller projects which can make a difference on the ground and directly help people. The rewards in Afghanistan have been rich. It has continued in training officials. Both Japan and the US have come forward to work with India on building connectivity both in Asia and Africa. All this is good politics. The fact that India's ties with the US are thriving is being watched with some concern in China. The need of the hour is to keep working in the neighbourhood, which has both cultural affinities with democratic India as well as excellent people to people contact. India and China will not go to war, the stakes are heavily loaded against a repeat of 1962. There is little reason to panic, but it is important to work on India's strengths. India should deepen its engagement with Pakistan instead of resorting to foolish measures such as   from across the border from working in India. This does not reflect the real Indian culture. Reaching out to the people of Pakistan bypassing the government and the Pakistan Army would have helped India's diplomatic prospects in the region.",2018-02-25,"India-Pakistan Relations,Pakistan Army,Maldives,Pakistan","India must reach out to all neighbours, including Pakistan, to counter China",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-china-relations-pakistan-maldives-pakistan-army-india-pakistan-relations/story/1/22540.html
507,Romita Datta,"""Even roadside telebhaja shops can be a good venture."" This is what Mamata Banerjee said in February 2015. She was talking about how a tea kiosk, a sweetmeat shop or a telebhaja joint can be considered business options by the unemployed youth of Bengal. She, however, desists from giving the unemployment figures for the state. The telebhaja suggestion plopped in the scene three years before Prime Minister Narendra Modi could cook up the pakora lines, the scent of which is wafting a spicy controversy among the jobless youth of the country. Borrowing a line, frequently borrowed from Gopal Krishna Gokhale by a contemporary Bengali political stalwart, this is a clear case of ""what Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow"".Not only this, there are multiple instances of NDA-led Centre thinking on the same lines as the government in Bengal. Sadly, no credits are being attributed to the Bengal chief minister. The BJP is not even ready to acknowledge that ""great men"" think alike and fools seldom differ. Take the case of Kanyashree - the state scheme aimed at empowering girls with a handsome stipend for pursuing higher studies instead of getting married at a young age. It was launched in 2013, exactly two years before PM Modi's ""Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao"". Though controversy and confusion refuse to die as to which came first - the egg or the chicken - the fact remains both are similar in their intent. The BJP might be claiming that BBBP is a better and more comprehensive policy bringing under its ambit the urgency to stop female foeticide, but the reality is that Kanyashree, being the first of its kind in stopping child marriage and school dropout, has won the hearts of the world winning Mamata the prestigious UN Public Service Day award for it in 2017. The recent spat over Kanyashree and BBBP between the governor of West Bengal Kesri Nath Tripathi and Mamata and her cabinet cronies is again a clear indication that neither is willing to give credit to the other. While Mamata thinks Kanyashree is unmatched in its scale and magnitude - Rs 5,000 crore as against Rs 100 crore yearly for BBBP, the Bengal governor thinks the constant drum-beating for Kanyashree is taking the wind or due credits away from Modi's scheme. Another example of thinking on similar lines is the much-touted Modicare, which is straight out of Mamata's Swasthyasathi - a health protection insurance coverage of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh (in case of critical illness) per year for 55 lakh people, rolled out in 2016. Modicare may be a magnified Swasthyasathi, involving 10 crore families and 50 crore people, but Swasthyasathi covers 1,900 ailments, treatment of which can be done in all government and 500 notified private hospitals. Both ambitious projects, however, have not taken into account the deficiency in infrastructure and the acute crisis of medical personnel. In Bengal, there is a shortfall of 33 per cent medical officers and doctors in the Directorate of Health Services and the picture is more or less similar across the country, where the doctor-patient ratio is 0.6:1,000. The thread of commonality runs beyond schemes and policy. Both do not bother about plurality of opinions in a democracy, majority of their decisions are arbitrary, their exclusive brainchild. Both are sensitive to criticisms, and reflect a poor sense of humour when the guffaw is on them, whereas they can choose to be extremely critical, often nasty, when it comes to pinning down somebody.When it comes to muscle-flexing, one struts around flaunting his 56-inch chest with a ""Big Brother"" attitude, the other prides in being a tiger, the royal Bengal tiger, who cannot be cowed down by agencies and the high-handedness of the Centre. And talk of connecting with people, Modi's ""Mann Ki Baat"" and ""Pariksha Pe Charcha"" draw resonance from Mamata's administrative meetings in the district, where apart from bureaucrats, students and commoners cannot just listen, but also participate. Mamata and Modi share a lot in common. They connect well with the masses, Mamata with her ""ma-maati-manush"", and Modi with ""mitron"". Being completely immersed in work, hardly dedicate anytime for their families. Both follow a strict and simple diet plan, and are committed to staying fit. Their handling of the press, and their ability to decimate the Opposition are much the same. Despite their similarities they appear as different as chalk and cheese. However, their careers have the same story of sweat, blood, humiliation and painstaking struggle. Their stories underline the rise and rise of common men without the backing of a political dynasty - the almost fairytale-like saga of rags to riches of a chaiwala and a woman, who sat at Haringhata Milk booths to deliver milk bottles. So close and yet so far - as Elvis Presley would sing.

508,Akshaya Nath,"Seventy-six km from Madurai, on the banks of the now dry Vaigai, is a small town Paramakudi with a population of less than 1 lakh (95,579, to be precise, according to Census 2011). The sleepy town boasts of an impressive sex ratio as well as literacy rate. However, it's not known for these reasons but for one man –  . Even though Haasan has spent very few years in Paramakudi, the impact that his family has had on the lives of the people here is immense.  The actor's ancestral house is now owned by Thamilarasu, a physical education teacher and, needless to say, a die-hard Haasan fan. “This is the biggest blessing in my life. I own the house in which Kamal sir too spent some years,” says the physical education teacher. The Thamilarasu family couldn't be happier to be in the spotlight even as their hero is set to  later today (February 21).   The family maintains the house like a shrine and have tried to keep important features of the house unchanged - for instance, the entrance door as carved by Haasan’s father D Srinivasa Iyengar, a painting by elder sister Nalini. “We didn’t want to change anything in the house, but some of them were too old and had to be replaced,” said Reeta, Thamilarasu’s wife. As visitors and fans come knocking on their door to see the house where Kamal Haasan once lived, the Thamilarasu family is more than happy to oblige them. “So many visitors come here, even tourists from Singapore and Malaysia. All his fans can't get enough of the place. Some touch the door, feel the walls, and even kiss the floor, as if it's a temple. It fills the heart with so much joy to see their love and devotion for Kamal sir.” The family’s allegiance towards Haasan knows no bounds. Thamilarasu, who was earlier an active member of Kamal Haasan Fans' Association, once had to spend a day in jail ""fighting"" for a Haasan’s film. He, however, describes the incident as one of the greatest achievements of his life. What's more, until 2014, the electricity bill for Thamilarasu's house used to come in the name of Haasan’s father. Thamilarasu couldn't muster the ""impertinence"" to get the name changed. Recollecting a tough phase in Haasan’s life and how he was able to do his bit, Thamilarasu says: “After the   controversy, Kamal sir had announced that he would leave the country. That time I sent him my house key and said the house still belongs to him. He  doesn't have to go anywhere. I requested him to come back here. Kamal sir still has a key to the house. He  even thanked me in his article in  .”   The sleepy town of Paramakudi not just has ""the honour of hosting"" the actor's ancestral house, but the people here also take immense pride in a primary school that was built by Haasan in his father's memory. While the people of Paramakudi have always loved the well-natured Srinivasa Iyengar and his son Kamal, who put the small town in the world map because of his cinematic skills, the locals here including close family friend advocate G Gopal are confident of his success in politics as well. “I'm sure he must have taken this decision long back and is the right person to join politics. Paramakudi will support him whole-heartedly."" Despite caste considerations in Tamil Nadu politics, like everywhere else across the country, Paramakudi residents feel the people across the state will embrace their reel hero in their real lives too with open arms. ""Caste and community don't matter… Jayalalithaa was from a minority community. Most Tamil Nadu CMs were from minority community just like Kamal Haasan,"" says another confident Hassan fan. Meanwhile, Thamilarasu has a lot on his mind. He is even ready to quit his government job to go and help out his idol. “If Kamal sir asks me, I will quit my job and join him,” he says even as wife Reeta nods understandably. Kamal Haasan has a huge fan base that has been converted into a welfare association. It is known for carrying out various social welfare measures.

While there is no dearth of fans, the question is whether the love of his ""devotees"" will make him a superstar in Tamil Nadu politics too.  ",2018-02-21,"Political debut,Politics,Tamil Nadu,Kamal Haasan","As Kamal Haasan launches party, this is what his home town Paramakudi expects from him",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kamal-haasan-party-launch-madurai-ancestral-home-paramakudi-fans/story/1/22471.html
509,Akshaya Nath,"Born to D Srinivasa Iyengar and Rajalakhmi of Paramakudi town, Kamal Haasan might be one of the biggest superstars in Indian cinema, but for the people of Tamil Nadu, especially his hometown, he is still one among them. Paramakudi and its people love the man because of whom their little-known town is in headlines, as the superstar formally began his  today with the launch of Makkal Needhi Maiam. 
 
 Although there are very few people left in his hometown who have personally known the family, every single one of them has fond memories of the enthusiastic, lovable young Haasan. Muthulakshmi, now in her mid-70s, was one of those people who played with Haasan when he was a child. Clad in a black and red sari, her voice changes as she starts recalling Haasan's childhood. “I was around 10 years old when he was a baby. He would never sit still, always up to something. He loved being carried around and I used to do that as they lived in the house next to ours. Aunty (Haasan's mother) used to pass him to me over the fence and I used to play with him.” Muthulakshmi also recalls how inspired by his sister, Haasan started learning dance and even participated in stage shows. Haasan was five years old when he made his debut as a child artist in   While it went on to become one of the best films of the time, young Kamal too received rave reviews for his performance.  “It was a superhit and all of us celebrated it in a big way here. He was our boy,” says Soundarajan, whose family used to run a hotel nearby. Haasan's father was a regular visitor. In fact, after the family initially moved to Chennai and Srinivasa Iyengar stayed back, it was Soundarajan’s Kuppanna Iyengar hotel where he would go to have his breakfast.   After entering showbiz, Haasan had to move to Chennai, something because of which he slowly lost touch with many back in his hometown. One of the last extended family members who still lives in Paramakudi is D Sowmyanarayanan. “I am the only person from the family here in Paramakudi now. Though we are all related, we hardly get to meet each other since most of them moved out of Paramakudi. Moreover, in absence of any elders, that common link is almost dead. I met Charuhasan and Subhashini [Maniratnam], Kamal’s brother and niece, at a wedding recently. But it has been a really long time since I last met Kamal.” But there are a few with whom the Haasan family continues to be in regular touch. Haasan’s neighbour in Paramakudi, advocate G Gopal, is one such person. In fact, the families still pay visits to one another. Talking about young Kamal’s love for cinema, Gopal says, “Kamal was in love with movies, as a child too. In fact, there was this MGR film,  , which ran for 100 days in Paramakudi, and Kamal had seen it every single day.” ""When he got his first ambassodor car, I was there at his Alwarpet residence in Chennai. Rajalakshmi Amma said ‘Gopalaa let’s go and take a ride'. Kamal’s mom and I were the first ones to sit in his car.”  Over the years these friends and well-wishers have turned into Kamal’s greatest supporters in public life too. In many occasions when he landed in controversies, they are were the first ones to lend their shoulders. One such recent incident was when Haasan was called “anti-Hindu” because of his remarks about sexism in   and even targetted him for his alleged Islamic faith.  “Kamal got the Haasan surname because of D Srinivasa Iyengar, who as a tribute to his friendship with Yaakob Haasan, with whom he briefly shared a prison cell during the freedom struggle, gave the surname to all his children. His father valued his friendships a lot,” adds Gopal.  The actor though in his interviews has given an alternative explanation too. According to him, Kamal means lotus and Haasan is derived from hasya, meaning laughter in Sanskrit.   As the man embarks on his political journey, the one aspect he is threading carefully and focussing on is the need for peace irrespective of religion, caste or creed. His friends and followers too believe so and are confident that caste and religion don't matter. “Bhaktavatsalam was a Mudaliar, Jayalalithaa was from a small Brahmin community. They too were from minority groups, but were successful. Kamal will also be able to make a difference,” says a confident Gopal. Sowmyanarayanan, who is at present a DMK supporter, proudly spoke about his cousin saying, “Kamal has brought big laurels to Paramakudi. He has made our small town visible in the national and international arena. I really hope his political career too touches similar heights.”  In Kollywood, Kamal Haasan is also known as Nammavar (a moniker that means ""our man"" given to the actor), and for the people he is indeed one among them. Haasan echoed the people's sentiments at the launch of his political outfit today, saying: “This is a party for you, for the people. I am your instrument, you are the leaders, this is a crowd full of leaders.”  ",2018-02-21,"Political debut,Politics,Tamil Nadu,Kamal Haasan",Makkal Needhi Maiam: What Kamal Haasan dedicating his party to the people means,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kamal-haasan-party-launch-makkal-needhi-maiam-tamil-nadu-party-of-the-people/story/1/22481.html
510,Noam A Osband,"Last week, the United States had yet another school shooting, as 17 children were slaughtered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida by a 19-year-old with a long history of troubled behaviour. Of course, in the United States, a history of mental illness and violent tendencies is no barrier to getting a weapon capable of murder, so we have such tragedies. Indeed, under Donald Trump, the government has actually  restrictions on gun purchases by citizens with mental illnesses. Yet, while the United States’ gun culture doesn’t fit into any medical definition of mental illness, it is clear the US has a pathological relationship with guns. I didn’t always think United States’ gun culture was so sick. It often takes leaving home to truly understand a place, and I only fully appreciated the depth of United States’ obsession with guns after spending a year in England in my mid-20s. During that time, a shooter killed 32 people at Virginia Tech, then the United States’ record for the worst shooting in a single day. Sadly, in the United States’ tradition of excess and violence, we have since broken that record. And broken it several times. The shooting dominated the news, and it served as a topic of conservation for several days in the house. I explained the American conservative reaction to my housemates, and they were utterly incapable of understanding it. When I explained to many in my country school that shootings are a sign that gun laws are too loose and that instead we need better laws to protect people, they didn’t simply disagree. They seemed unable to understand how anyone could ever come to that conclusion. To them, it wasn’t a reasonable argument they disagreed with. Rather, they saw it as completely irrational, the logic of a lunatic. This was my first time having a sustained conversation outside the United States about my country’s gun policies, and I was seeing it through new eyes. Although I always disagreed with the notion that more guns means more safety, for me, it always had a coherence. The reaction of my roommates made me question that. It made me realise just how unhinged the United States’ gun culture is, how divorced it is from fact and reason, and how hard it can be to truly gain that perspective from within the country. The United States’ veneration of guns is dogmatic, hard-wired into our culture. The weapon is venerated in our movies, and   it at  . We are one of the   where gun rights are enshrined in the Constitution, and the only one of those countries where it is unrestricted. This devotion to the second amendment and its right to bear arms has all the trappings of religious dogma, a belief in a worldview that cannot be changed by empirical reality. In one particularly moving essay, Gary Willis  our love of guns to the worship of Moloch described in the bible, a deity whose followers sacrificed their children in devotion to their God. Perhaps, no greater sign of gun rights dogmatism, of the complete opposition to the empirical reality found by those who oppose modest gun control is the fact that, starting in 1996, the Congress  the Center for Disease Control (CDC) from studying the link between guns and public health. The CDC is the main government public health institution, and somehow they are forbidden from studying a tool that kills more than 30,000 Americans a year. Literally, more than one per cent of Americans die of  , yet the national government refuses to invest in studying this. It is no coincidence that the same side of American politics that irrationally refuses to acknowledge a link between guns and gun violence shows a similar incoherence with global warming — an unwillingness to engage in discussion about the deepening crisis. Sure, 17 children are dead but don’t comment on the tool of violence, lest you politicise the event. Yes, Houston is submerged under a biblical flood but don’t link it to the scientific consensus. Often, after these shootings, politicians say we need a renewed focus on treating mental illness, as if that is the variable that is the problem rather than the simple fact that the country has too many of these weapons of death. There are literally   in this country as there are people. People are people, and mental illness will always exist. Semiautomatic weapons however do not always exist, and they definitely don’t need to be sold to the public. Yet, until my country begins to accept the reality, to recognise that just as surely as the sun rises in the east, letting people collect innumerable and immensely powerful guns will result in death, we are destined to suffer more deaths. That’s reality. There has been one glimmer of hope this weekend. In the wake of the shooting, survivors of the attack have been engaged in a   of public activism over gun control. On Saturday, at a rally, Emma Gonzales, a survivor of the shooting, gave a speech that quickly went viral. At the end, she led a call and response where the crowd chanted “we call BS” on the idea that gun policy can’t lead to a decrease in gun deaths. In the age of fake news and delusion, when obvious facts are ignored with deadly consequences, it was inspiring to see students so clearly and boldly state to their older leaders that they will actively oppose their obvious lies. There is a simplicity and clarity to their call that is undeniable, and it gives me hope that perhaps more American politicians and voters, too, will begin to acknowledge the reality.",2018-02-19,"Second Amendment,Gun violence,Gun control",Why United States takes its guns to school,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/florida-mass-shooting-kills-17-gun-control-us-second-amendment/story/1/22434.html
511,Anand Kochukudy,"The   of Youth Congress block secretary, SP Shuhaib, is the latest in the long list of political   since half a century. Incidentally, one of the accused in the 1969 murder that set off this cycle of violence is incumbent chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and it was widely hoped he would be the one to bell the cat. But as the number of political murders in his less than two-year term stand at 22, one has to assume that the chief minister, who also holds the state home ministry, has failed in this endeavour miserably. At around 11.15pm on February 12, a four-member gang arrived at a roadside eatery in a car and hurled two crude bombs. Two men with machetes pounced on Shuhaib and they hacked him repeatedly below his waist. The post-mortem report records 41 hack wounds, of which 37 were inflicted below his waist. The gruesome attack reminded Keralites of a similar barbaric attack on renegade Marxist TP Chandrasekharan in 2012 by cadres of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). A video of CPM flag-bearing activists airing death threats against Shuhaib has surfaced, pointing the finger of suspicion clearly at the ruling party in the state. The CPM workers' rant ""your days are numbered"" can be clearly heard in the video. Meanwhile, CPM's Kannur district secretary P Jayarajan had declared that they have nothing to do with the murder. (Similar declarations were also made in the wake of TP Chandrasekharan's murder by then state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan). With the surrender of two CPM members - Akash Thillangeri and Rijin Raj - following a search operation at ""party villages"" in Kannur, these declarations by senior leaders have been belied. What makes the latest murder stand out from the spate of murders in the last couple of decades is the fact that it has the potential to initiate a new wave of violence and drag Congress back into Kannur's murder politics. The Kannur feud, involving CPM and BJP/RSS since the 1980s, has dominated the discourse on the politics of murders as other parties such as the Muslim League and the Congress have gradually scaled down their involvement in violence. Congress, in particular, has completely abandoned it since 2000. While the party was in the thick of things in the 1970s, they have been on the sidelines of extermination politics since the 1980s despite remaining the primary Opposition party in the state and the district. Congress' Kannur face K Sudhakaran has begun a 48-hour fast from Monday and has warned of converting it into an indefinite hunger strike if the ""real"" culprits aren't arrested by then. Kannur's cycle of violence sustains on ""proxy culprits"" in which the parties involved present proxies in place of real perpetrators in connivance with police officers that ultimately leads to acquittals at the trial stage. Shuhaib was a protege of Sudhakaran and was also actively involved in religious and charitable activities of Sunni Students' Federation (SSF), the youth wing of AP Sunni faction. Incidentally, the AP Sunnis led by Kanthapuram Aboobackar Musaliar has always backed the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala and this murder spoil things altogether. What began as a local Kerala Students Union (KSU)-Students Federation of India (SFI) skirmish (Student bodies of Congress and CPM intensified when Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU)-the Marxist trade union arm-workers got involved). But how did it lead to such a brutal murder? Shuhaib's uncle Ismail reveals that his nephew was a CPM sympathiser, who moved to the Congress before 2015 though he never revealed the reason for that switch. Shuhaib had led the Congress' civic poll campaign in Edayannur and Therur wards in the CPM-dominated Keezhallur panchayat. With his influence in SSF, Congress won both wards. Congress won even without the backing of its ally Indian Union Muslim League in these wards - which rang alarm bells in CPM that enjoys dominance in these parts of Kannur. Apostasy is not taken lightly in Marxist strongholds and Congress' abandonment of extermination politics has seen a large number of ex-CPM cadres flocking to BJP/RSS and even vice versa. Ideology is secondary when it comes to such abandonments as the primary motive is to settle scores or self-preservation. Shuhaib's murder is also reminiscent of the , a Muslim League student leader in 2012 in Kannur. Incidentally, Thalassery MLA AN Shamseer owned up to the murder during a television debate. While CPM used the minority protection card in the 2016 Assembly elections, Shuhaib's murder may not go down well with many in the community. It has also come to light that an attack might have been planned on Shuhaib in   where rules are regularly flouted by political prisoners in connivance with police officials. When Shuhaib was arrested after a clash with CPM on January 13, the magistrate court ordered that he be lodged in the sub-jail for undertrials. But in an inexplicable move, he was swiftly shifted to the special sub-jail located in the Kannur central jail. K Sudhakaran had intervened with jail DGP R Sreelekha to shift him back to the sub-jail then. Shuhaib's father, Muhammed, was also aware of the threats to his son's life and has confirmed receiving such messages on his phone. Shuhaib was the sole breadwinner of his family comprising three sisters. The human suffering in Kannur's murder politics is often a neglected topic. Political murders have crippled many families in this district and while parties use them as ""martyrs"" to further their politics, the families are left to suffer. A few months back, BJP had unleashed a campaign nationally against the ruling CPM accusing them of spreading ""red terror"" in Kerala. People of Kerala were unanimous in thwarting the propaganda and were quick to point out that it wasn't a unidimensional issue. Marxists will have to come around the reality that extermination politics has no place in a civilised society in 2018. A lot of their omissions and commissions have been conveniently ignored over the years due to their utility in preventing the growth of communal politics in Kerala, where people live in complete harmony. But if these murders keep repeating every now and then under their rule, one will have to question their commitment to law and order. While they claim to have lost more people than the BJP/RSS since the 1980s, these arguments fall apart if we are to take into account the past two years alone of Vijayan's chief ministership. CPM has lost only three lives against seven on the other side in Kannur in this brief period. Chief minister Vijayan chose to remain mum on this ghastly incident for six days. He only spoke on February 18. It seems the transformation from being the ringleader of Marxist politics in Kannur to the people's chief minister hasn't been an easy one. But if the police choose to act as an extension of the party in this case (Kannur SP has upbraided his subordinates for leaking information to the party and has officially complained to the state DGP), a new wave of violence will be the natural consequence and Kerala can ill-afford setting the clock back.",2018-02-19,"Pinarayi Vijayan,Communists,SP Shuhaib,Political violence in Kerala",Killing of Youth Congress leader SP Shuhaib may spark a wave of violence in Kerala,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/political-violence-in-kerala-sp-shuhaib-communists-pinarayi-vijayan-kerala-kannur/story/1/22440.html
512,Harsh V Pant,"Hassan Rouhani’s visit to Delhi was the first by an Iranian president in 10 years and it was much needed. His talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi were deemed substantive and the two leaders emphasised the need to build stronger relations. Modi suggested that the visit by the Iranian president underscored how the two sides want to deepen cooperation in key areas, including connectivity, even as Rouhani repeated his nation’s resolve “to combat terrorism and extremism”. A dozen pacts were signed including one on double taxation avoidance and another for the leasing by an Indian company of a container terminal facility in Iran’s Chabahar port. But the Indo-Iranian relations are facing some strong headwinds. Last month Donald Trump decided not to pull Washington out of a deal that it and other world powers made with Tehran to limit Iran’s nuclear programme. But he gave a strong warning to other countries in the deal. Make the deal tougher, or the US will stop keeping its end of the bargain with sanctions relief. At the same time, the Trump administration has imposed new targeted sanctions on 14 Iranian individuals and entities in connection with various human rights abuses. This was the same strategy that Washington adopted last year when it waived the sanctions but imposed sanctions on seven targets involved in Iran’s ballistic missile programme, including two senior Iranian defence officials, one of whom allegedly helps to arm Assad and a China-based network that allegedly supports Iran’s military by supplying millions of dollars’ worth of items used in missile production. The US president had informed the US Congress in October last year that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal is no longer in the country’s national security interest, calling it the “worst deal ever”. But instead of scrapping the deal outright, he had put the ball in Congress’ court asking the legislators to modify the agreement even as his administration marshals international support to increase pressure on Iran. Defying Trump, the European Union made it clear that it would defend the agreement. Though European officials have tried for a unified response to Trump’s pulling out from the 2015 Iranian nuclear accord, strains have emerged within that threaten to weaken Europe’s common stance. The European Union has made it clear that it is not open for renegotiation. The British, French and Germans have been lobbying hard to keep the Trump administration in, arguing that the deal is working. As West Asia continues to pass through a phase of unprecedented churn, Iran has emerged as, perhaps, the most potent force in the region. The US is itself responsible for this as its removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, which had always been a strategic counterweight to Tehran, resulted in this situation. Tehran has been effective in leveraging the regional realities to serve its foreign policy agenda. With the Islamic State (ISIS) facing a regional retreat, proxy wars are underway in Iraq and Syria for a distribution of the spoils. Iran’s influence over the Shia-dominated government and many militia forces in Iraq has given Tehran unprecedented leverage in shaping the political future of Iraq. And in Syria, Iran’s sustained backing of the Assad regime has made the survival of the regime possible despite the challenge posed by the US-backed groups. With their position entrenched in Syria and their influence in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen secure, Iran and Hezbollah and their Shiite allies believe they have built a formidable, unified, border-spanning front. How they choose to exert their power could dictate the future trajectory of the wider West Asia. Israel and Iran are coming to blows in Syria. As a result, despite Trump’s threats, Iran is placed much better in the region than ever before. But tensions between Washington and Tehran constrain the strategic space for India in dealing with Iran. New Delhi has, therefore, welcomed the 2015 nuclear deal. Given the isolation facing Washington on its new Iran policy, India may not have to worry too much in the immediate future. In fact, what should be more worrying for India is the slow pace of the Chabahar port project, which has irked the Iranians, and they have indicated that despite India developing the project, it won’t be exclusive to the country. Pakistan and China might also be invited to get involved. Chabahar is seen as India’s answer to the Gwadar port, which will allow it to circumvent Pakistan and open up a route to landlocked Afghanistan. Bringing China and Pakistan in will be a challenge to Indian interests. Uncertainty surrounding American posture towards Iran is complicating India’s ability to deliver fast on Chabahar as Western manufacturers remain wary of supplying equipment for the Iranian port. The first phase of the project was completed and inaugurated in December but much more remains to be done before the project becomes the strategic nodal point that New Delhi perhaps wants it to be. The Indo-Iranian cooperation on Afghanistan is also coming under stress with Tehran joining Russia and China in managing Pakistan’s role in the region. The ISIS is viewed as the bigger threat in Afghanistan than the Taliban by these states. Though the larger trade and energy ties between India and Iran are gradually growing, they are being overshadowed by India’s growing stakes in the Arab world and Israel. The Iranian president’s visit to India has made a modest effort towards adding dynamism to Indo-Iranian ties. It remains to be seen how far this will go as a new power configuration emerges in India’s extended neighbourhood which India will have to navigate carefully.

513,Rajeev Sharma,"Even the most hardcore among the Narendra Modi loyalists cannot say that the   worth $1.77 billion (approx  ) hasn't negatively impacted the image of the Modi government, irrespective of whether the largest banking fraud in Indian history predated the Modi era or whether the Modi government is reaping the harvest of what was originally sown by the UPA government. For the common man what matters is that this mega scam has tumbled out of the closet during the Modi government. Therefore, this development will inevitably have some kind of negative impact. The million dollar question is whether the Modi government will bear political losses or will the Opposition reap some political benefits from this development? Well, the answer is in the womb of time and will be known upfront on March 3 when the results of   are out. Yes, the results of Nagaland and Meghalaya Assembly polls too will be out on that day but the BJP doesn't have much electoral presence of its own in these two northeastern states. Tripura results should serve as the answer, politically speaking, as the top leadership of the BJP is actively involved in these elections, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself. Ground reports suggest the BJP was well poised to give the CPM-ruled government of chief minister Manik Sarkar a run for its money. The BJP was seen as a serious contender with the potential to emerge victorious in the Tripura elections and end the 20-year-old rule of the Manik Sarkar government. But this was before the PNB fraud flew into the face of the BJP government at the Centre. PM Modi is adept at coining political catchphrases and words during election campaigns which have invariably cost the Opposition dear. Who can, for instance, forget his  in the middle of Uttar Pradesh elections which eventually pulled the carpet from under the feet of the Opposition and installed a BJP government with an unprecedented majority in India's most populous and electorally the biggest state - and that too a crucial swing state? PM Modi came up with a similar clever remark during Tripura election campaigning when he said this at a public rally: ""It is as if an astrologer has given you a Manik (gemstone) to wear and it has turned out to be the wrong Manik (read chief minister Manik Sarkar). So while the country developed, achhe din never came to Tripura. It is time to take off the wrong Manik and instead I offer you a HIRA - Highways, I-ways, Railways and Airways."" He made this remark at an election rally in Sonamura, Tripura on February 9. Little did he realise that a crowning irony was waiting to happen with ""Hira"" (diamond) trader Nirav Modi rocking his boat in a big way. Thus his remark that the people of Tripura should shun ""Manik"" or gem (chief minister Manik Sarkar) and embrace ""HIRA"" (diamond) unintentionally turned ironical. Normally, national issues hardly dominate the agenda and outcome of state assembly polls, much less in context of the far-flung northeastern states. But Tripura, a traditional Left bastion where the BJP tried its hardest to dictate a new political narrative and change the political discourse, may well prove to be a different case altogether. Away from the glare of northeastern politics, the PNB fraud is likely to have an adverse economic fallout. It may compel rating agencies such as Moody's to downgrade India's ratings. It may also adversely impact the carefully nurtured image of the Modi government in terms of Ease of Doing Business and inflict political costs on the Modi government. The Opposition has already got hold of an important political stick to beat the Modi government with. The social media is full of derisive variations of PM Modi's  : ""Na khaoonga, na khaane doonga"" (I will neither indulge in corruption nor allow others a chance to be corrupt). The trending message on social media is: ""Na khaoonga, na khaane doonga; sirf bhaagne doonga"" (Won't indulge in corruption, won't allow others to be corrupt; but will allow the corrupt to escape)."" If the court   had come before Gujarat went to polls, the results (BJP 99, Congress 80) could have been different. But the PNB fraud case has panned out before Tripura polls. Cases like these have the potential to influence both national and state level politics. Whether the fraud impacts the Tripura polls remains to be seen. The Tripura results will determine whether the impact of national events on state Assembly polls is just a speculation or a stark reality. If despite this the BJP wins Tripura and unseats the ruling CPM, it will only go to show that Modi's Teflon image is still intact. A contrary result will prove the opposite. This, in turn, would mean that Modi's BJP would have a lot to worry about in its Mission 2019.",2018-02-17,"PNB fraud,Lok Sabha Polls,BJP,Narendra Modi","How Nirav Modi swindling Punjab National Bank of Rs 11,000cr will impact Modi government",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tripura-elections-nirav-modi-narendra-modi-bjp-lok-sabha-polls-pnb-fraud/story/1/22407.html
514,Geeta Mohan,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's   to India marks the beginning of a greater India-Canada cooperation. A global leader, who has become the face of free voice, diversity and unity, comes to India at a time when we are grappling with the issue of ""tolerance"". In the entire insider-outsider, us versus them debate, Trudeau has shone like a beacon of light for those who wish to see alleviation and elimination of such a vicious global environment. 
 
 He has invited with open arms those who have been shunned in their own homeland, those who look to Canada for a brighter future, those who need space to be heard. Trudeau has been an answer to scores of Indians as well. In 2016 alone, around 40,000 Indian immigrants found home in Canada. Today the Indian community in Canada makes up for a significant vote bank and some have made it to Trudeau's cabinet. The reason why this visit is more important to Canada than maybe to India is the huge constituency Prime Minister Trudeau has to cater to back home, the huge Indian community, particularly from Punjab. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always considered the Indian community living overseas an important component of his foreign policy toolkit. As part of India's ""soft power"" policy, Indians living abroad have become ""influencers"". But Canada is a unique case where while we have Indian origin parliamentarians contending to become PM, we also have some members of the very same community supporting growing Sikh radicalism that is reviving the Khalistani movement in Canada. A matter of grave concern to India. One that has been raised by India at all official levels. India and Canada have grown leaps and bounds when it comes to trade, investment and the energy sectors although both agree there is room for more. But the area that we have lagged behind in is security and the strategic sphere. Do our interests converge? Are we on the same page when it comes to security concerns? Security isn't about regional and global arena. It starts from home. The questions that are being raised are whether both countries would be able to find a way to understand each other's concerns. India has made amply clear the impact this resurgence could have on India's security. But, Trudeau looks at the community as a celebration of cultures and peoples. He in fact attended an event in April 2017 in Toronto which had Khalistani flags and pictures of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a terrorist killed in action in Punjab, put up everywhere. Unaware or unconcerned of the sensitivity involved? There is a reason why Canadian leadership has tread very carefully in the past on the issue because the 1985 Kanishka bombing, which killed a total of 329 people, including 268 Canadians, 27 Britishers and 24 Indians; remains a reminder of the devastation such movements can cause. Canada might have moved on and away from this horrid past, but this continues to remain a part of the conversations between India and Canada. While India has been engaging Canada to look at the bigger picture and not get confined in petty political bickering, the fact is that there is more to the ties between India and Canada and hence the need to delink the ""Khalistan"" issue from the substantive part of our ties. India and Canada have many areas in which they can benefit from mutual cooperation. Trade, job creation, investment sector are just some of those areas. Apart from this, climate change, and counter-terrorism (every vote at the world body counts) are areas where the two countries can benefit by working closely. Canada has   India's bid to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group. There is much to gain for both the countries. But much more can be achieved if the leaders' can find common grounds on all issues. Canada will have to differentiate between ""diversity"" and ""extremism"" and India will have to make a distinction between ""freedom of speech and action"" and ""intolerance"" in the name of that same freedom.",2018-02-17,"Diversity,Extremism,Toronto,NSG",Can India and Canada use Justin Trudeau's visit to move beyond Khalistan,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/justin-trudeau-canada-khalistan-nsg-toronto-extremism-diversity/story/1/22408.html
515,Asit Jolly,"Captain Amarinder Singh’s consistent refusal to engage with Sikh ministers within Canada’s federal government who were reported to have Khalistani leanings has forced the ministers to clarify their position. The denials by defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan and infrastructure minister Amarjit Sohi have been issued just days ahead of, and evidently prompted by, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s first state visit to India later this month. Reports in the Canadian media have quoted Sohi as saying that “he does not sympathise with the cause (Khalistan), nor does he hear much talk about it in the (Canadian) Sikh community.” Sajjan, who was refused an audience by the Punjab chief minister when he visited Chandigarh and Punjab last year (2017) because of his purported “Khalistani connections,” also refuted the charge as being “ridiculous.” The Canadian defence minister said in Ottawa: “I’ve been a police officer, I’ve served my country and any allegations like that is absolutely ridiculous and I find it extremely offensive as well.” Reflecting the growing political influence of the Sikh community in Canada, as many as 16 MPs of Sikh origin were elected in the federal elections in 2015. But this has been accompanied by a visible proliferation of Khalistani separatists, who have reportedly been employing North American gurudwaras to continue fuelling demands for “liberating Punjab from Indian domination.” In fact, there have been worrying reports of Khalistanis forcibly preventing Indian representatives and officials from entering gurudwaras in Canada. Police and intelligence officials in Punjab claim that Canada-based Khalistanis and their sympathisers contribute the largest chunk of illegal hawala funding that is being used to try and revive the moribund separatist movement in Punjab. Although Prime Ministers Trudeau and Narendra Modi appear to share a comfortable rapport and have met one-on-one on the sidelines of several international meetings, including most recently, the World Economic Forum at Davos, the free rein given to Khalistanis in Canada has cast a shadow on Trudeau's upcoming five-day visit. The trip, slated to focus on trade and cultural ties between the two countries, significantly includes a visit to the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Commentators say, given that Indo-Canadians now number at 1.2 million, the India-Punjab visit could boost Trudeau’s prospects for re-election. Reportedly advised to make amends, Sohi has clarified his position: “If there is a small segment of people in Canada who talk about separation, who talk about the creation of Khalistan, if they do that in a peaceful way that is their right to do so but this is not an issue that I hear in the community,” the minister was quoted (in Canadian media) as having said in Ottawa. “From my point of view this is not an issue for the Canadian population, this is not an issue for the Indo-Canadian community within Canada, and I don’t feel it necessary to be engaging in something that is completely irrelevant from a Canadian’s point of view.” Quick to respond, Amarinder welcomed the clarifications by Sajjan and Sohi. “I congratulate Prime Minister Trudeau for creating the necessary environment against secessionist forces believed to be operating from his country,” the chief minister said. It’s typically Amarinder to take what may seem like a contentious position to many, and then stick to his guns. On a visit to Toronto during his earlier, 2002-2007, tenure as CM, Amarinder was accused of ""hob-nobbing with Khalistanis"". His rivals in the Shiromani Akali Dal quite literally went to town decrying his visit to a ""Khalistani"" gurudwara in Dixieland (Toronto). Local media in Punjab was flooded with pictures showing the chief minister standing below a ""Khalistan Zindabad"" banner while addressing a congregation inside the shrine. Unperturbed, Amarinder called a news conference in Chandigarh. “Any gurudwara is the home of my Gurus and I reserve the right to go there. hanging up nonsensical banners doesn’t change that and I will never be deterred from going to any gurudwara,” he told visibly surprised reporters who had come expecting long, convoluted explanations, even an apology?

516,Suman Chattopadhyay,"When we reached the banks of the Sarayu, we were surprised to see a crowd of not more than ten thousand, most of whom were filling polythene bags with hands full of sand from the riverbank. Where were the two hundred thousand karsevaks that we were expecting? We smelt a rat. Was the press meeting hogwash then? Did the leaders have other plans up their sleeves? Upon reflection, I have felt that the Babri Masjid would have stayed intact if the plans were not changed at the eleventh hour. While the mosque was being destroyed and was falling like the wall of Jericho, we heard that it was Vinay Katiyar who pressurised the leaders of the movement against a symbolic karseva. He argued that repeated tokenism in the name of karseva would not go down well with the devotees who had been clamouring for action for a long time. Katiyar was the chief of Bajrang Dal. He had won the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket in the 1991 general elections. He is a belligerent man, who does not mince words. When during the karseva in October 1991, a few young men scaled the dome of the Masjid, Katiyar had to face the wrath of the karsevaks in trying to dissuade them. This time round, he wanted a more concrete action plan that would satisfy his supporters. The karsevaks were in no mood to leave the Masjid premises and go to the banks of the Sarayu. When we reached the karseva venue, BP Toshniwal endorsed the changed plan. “It has been decided at the last moment that the karsevaks would congregate at the Rama Katha Kunj ground, from where they would be sent in small batches to the venue,” he said. In other words, they would be spared the long walk. The decision seemed justified and never did we anticipate that the assembling two hundred thousand karsevaks near the venue could be part of a bigger agenda, until around an hour later, when the first signs of lawlessness became visible. While we were talking to Toshniwal, the Rama Katha Kunj and its approach road were overflowing with karsevaks. RSS volunteers were manning the Rama Deewar with great alacrity. Ram Shankar Agnihotri, the loudmouth spokesman of the VHP, had informed us that a special arrangement for journalists had been made on the roof of Manas Bhavan, adjacent to the venue on its eastern side. But who would care for a seat in the stands when one could get a decidedly better view from the sidelines? I proudly displayed the pink press card given by the VHP and was promptly allowed by RSS volunteers inside the mosque premises. When I had come to cover the karseva in July, I noticed that the BJP government of Uttar Pradesh led by Kalyan Singh had changed the very look of the mosque premises. It had acquired 2.77 acres of land next to the mosque and levelled it. There was no sign of the spot which was the centre of dispute owing to the laying of the foundation stone of the temple in 1989. Instead, the July karseva aimed at laying the foundation of the main entrance of the temple designed by Sompura. The gate would be 166 feet long and 80 feet wide. Throwing the court order to the wind, the July karseva ended after the foundation was laid. The December karseva was meant to “cleanse” this foundation. A crowd of hardly 500 volunteers and sadhus greeted us at the site. A copper pot adorned with a vermilion swastika was shining in the morning sun, right in the middle of the site. All arrangements for an elaborate puja were complete, with the whole area decked up with mango leaves, garlands and flower petals. Acharya Bamdev was supposed to preside over the official karseva at quarter past twelve. That would mean that the sadhus would start the puja and cleansing of the platform while the karsevaks, in small batches, would fill the cavities with sand. Tej Shankar, the royally treated Supreme Court observer, seemed happy with the proceedings. The evening before, he had faxed the apex court that all was well and in keeping with the court’s directives. That is, no construction work was happening in the acquired land. One of the first to arrive at the venue was Acharya Haricharan Das of the Vaishnava sect of Chitrakoot and with him a teenaged sadhu who was a sight to behold. Wearing a turmeric-coloured dhoti tied like a lungi, Raghunandan had covered his upper torso with a namavali printed with “Hare Krishna Hare Rama” (a namavali is a shawl with names of gods printed on it). Every part of his body, the shaven head downwards was covered with the red of the tilak. The first thing he did after taking his seat was to bring out two shovels from his bag. Dharamdas, the six-and-a-half-foot tall sadhu, who was nearby, promptly held him by his neck and threw him out of the premises. It seemed that Dharamdas, the pehalwan who shadowed Katiyar wherever he went, was there to ensure that the court directive was complied with in letter and spirit. Certainly a teenaged sadhu had no business to defy court orders under his nose. Even as Raghunandan was trying to gather himself from the sudden assault, about 200 karsevaks were trying to elbow their way in. All of them were wielding trishuls. Many of the jawans of Provincial Arms Constabulary (PAC) had vermilion tilaks on their foreheads and even the RSS knew that they were hardly dependable. The RSS volunteers themselves formed the second line of defence behind these PAC jawans. One of them assured the police, “Don’t you worry. We’ll handle this”. The PAC jawans were only too happy to have this assurance. The PAC, a paramilitary outfit, formed during the regime of chief minister Narayan Dutt Tiwari, had never remained neutral during communal riots in the state. Every time a karseva took place in Ayodhya, the PAC stood behind the karsevaks openly. It would have been impossible for the karsevaks to break the security cordon and reach Ayodhya during the karseva of 1990, if the PAC had firmly stood its ground. The karsevaks’ happiness with the PAC was in equal measure of their unhappiness with the CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force). The moment the PAC distanced itself from the scene, a scuffle ensued between the RSS volunteers and the karsevaks. A deluge of karsevaks kept lashing at the gate. Moments later, they were hounded away by the volunteers. The resistance lasted for not more than fifteen minutes. About 150 young men with trishuls and iron rods barged in at the site. The karsevaks went into a tizzy, gyrating with chants of “Jai Shri Ram”. This “Rama dance” which was a mixture of tandava, breakdance and disco, was also a by-product of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Maniram from Rajasthan was one of the revellers. His wafer-thin torso bore obvious signs of poverty, but that did not take away his zeal. He accosted me, looked into my eyes and my press card, and with a frightening frown yelled, “Jai Shri Ram”. I repeated the chant with him, something that I had learnt to do with experience. And then I asked, almost apologetically, “What about the court orders?” Moments later, I was surrounded by ten other karsevaks, spitting venom at the court and telling me in no uncertain terms that a media person would be better off by staying away from the scene. An RSS volunteer came to my rescue and with folded hands asked me to move away. Arguing would be foolhardy, I thought and moved to a nearby hillock that till the previous year housed the police control room. I saw Shrish Chandra Dikshit, former DIG of UP police-turned-BJP MP from Varanasi and vice president of the VHP, in a saffron cap, sitting on a brick. Giving him company were Uma Shankar Bajpai, DIG of Faizabad division, along with the leader of the almost non-existent Panther Party of Kahsmir, Bhim Singh, with his journalist wife, Sheela. Amid the din and bustle, Ashok Singhal entered the site from the Hanumangarh Road, accompanying Shiv Sena MP Moreshwar Save. A huge cheer of “Har Har Mahadev, Har Bhavani” greeted them. Singhal showed him around, as though Save was a VVIP. In about ten minutes came LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, both with grim faces. Joshi exchanged greetings with us and almost like a soliloquy said, “Let’s see what happens”. And then both the BJP leaders left, taking the approach road off Hanumangarh, to the roof of the VHP office in Rama Katha Kunj that was turned into a makeshift dais for the leaders after the crowd was shifted from the banks of the Sarayu. All the while, the number of karsevaks at the Sankat Mochan gate was increasing like floodwater. The RSS volunteers were now clearly being outnumbered and many of them were injured during the scuffle. Next to the gate were three metal detectors leading into three narrow lanes. This was the official route for the devotees to enter the structure housing the “Ramlala”. A few karsevaks chose to climb atop the metal detectors and were dangling their feet from above. Dharamdas was trying in vain to dissuade them. I suddenly found three journalist friends, Manimoy Dasgupta and Ashok Malik of   and SNM Abdi of  , beside me. “We have just surveyed the back of the mosque. A few hundred karsevaks with spades and shovels have assembled there. I have a fear that they will demolish the mosque today,” said a visibly frightened Abdi. “Do not read much into those preparations. Even if someone scales the tombs of the mosque, they will raise a saffron flag there and nothing more. Similar things happened last year on 31 October, CRPF jawans pulled them down,” I assured Abdi. Abdi’s worst fears came true, but at least, at that point in time, I had confidence on the political will and the discipline of the RSS leaders. I was proved wrong. I was smoking, a few too many cigarettes than I normally would. Shankar, a karsevak from Baramati in Maharashtra, the home turf of Sharad Pawar, came up and asked for a smoke. “It’s futile to lecture us on the court orders. Every time, we are being made pawns of a stupid political game. It’s now or never,” he warned. Even as we spoke, I saw a group of young men in yellow headbands rushing through the approach road gate. They were members of RSS’s Rapid Action Force. They pounced on the euphoric karsevaks and beat them out of the territory. A photo journalist, a foreigner, was trying to take snaps. “No photo, no photo,” screamed a few members of the RSS’s force. Some of them chased him. The poor man lost his balance and fell on some loose bricks. The RSS volunteers seemed teeming with confidence, having won this pitched battle. The battles went on for an hour. And the RSS volunteers were up against a formidable enemy, egged on by local leader Mahesh Narayan Singh. “Those who are combating us are not disciples of Rama. And neither are they karsevaks. They are plants of VP Singh, Mulayam Singh and Narasimha Rao. Do not fall into their traps,” he kept thundering. Dharamdas was at his job. He snatched a cane rod from a PAC jawan and started beating up the karsevaks mercilessly. Moments later, I saw him lying on the ground, with a few karsevaks sitting on him and beating him black and blue. Dharamdas was a wise man. He clearly saw this as a lost battle, somehow regained his foothold and ran away for dear life, clutching at his saffron dhoti. That was the final frontier that the karsevaks had to cross. With his exit, the floodgates were thrown open. Hundreds of karsevaks romped through the various entry points and, like a herd of wild bison, ran towards the mosque. I looked around and found no trace of Dixit or Bhim Singh or his wife. Geetha Siddharthan of the   was the only person other than me on the hillock. To my utter disbelief, I saw that two youths had scaled the middle tomb and were dancing away to glory. Even a moment before this, the leaders of the Sangh Parivar had no inkling of the madness that was happening at the karseva site. Sitting pretty on the roof of the VHP office, they mistook the battle sounds for some street brawl. The top leaders of the Sangh Parivar, Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia, LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Ashok Singhal, HV Seshadri, KS Sudarshan, Vinay Katiyar, Uma Bharti and Sadhvi Rithambara were enjoying the December sun and cracking jokes among themselves. It was a picnic alright. Seshadri and Sudarshan, two very influential leaders of the RSS, had been camping in Ayodhya for a week now. They had visited every camp of the karsevaks and explained to them in great detail the court orders and how important it was to maintain discipline. These leaders were confident that no one from the Sangh Parivar would dare defy them. And they were there in person to ensure that everything went smoothly. Although Advani reached the pinnacle of political success riding on the wave of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, the BJP had done precious little for the cause before the summer of 1989. It was Ashok Singhal, the all-powerful general secretary of the VHP, who led the movement from the front. He got together sadhus from across the country and united them. Singhal nursed a grief within, as he was not so much in the limelight as an Advani or a Joshi was, but he was politically astute enough not to bring it out in the open. However, his attitude reflected his confidence and arrogance. He hated the so-called “pseudo-secular press” with all the contempt at his command. The two undisputed queen bees of the movement were Uma Bharti and Sadhvi Rithambara. Both were powerful orators and rabble-rousers who could address a captive audience for hours. In terms of popularity among the karsevaks, they were way ahead of Advani or Joshi. Uma reached Ayodhya a few days before December 6. Rithambara was seen on the spot only on that morning. Advani and Joshi came to Ayodhya from Lucknow where they addressed a rally along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Vajpayee, as was always his wont, did not participate in the karseva and went back to Delhi. It was anyway a big day for journalists, just to have all the top leaders of the Sangh Parivar on the same dais in an open arena. Vinay Katiyar was the man in charge. Clad in an impeccably creased white dhoti–kurta, he started off the proceedings at the stroke of eleven. Yugpurush Paramanand, the guru of Rithambara, explained how the karseva would be conducted. Ashok Singhal warned the crowd not to fall prey to the provocative stories that the media was writing about the karseva and not to breach discipline. As it happened, the crowd did not give two hoots about Singhal’s diktat on discipline but they certainly did take a cue from him on how to handle the press. Murli Manohar Joshi, the then BJP president whose journey to Ayodhya from Delhi proved disastrous, was visibly moved to see an ocean of humanity in front of him. In a trembling voice, he delivered a speech, the high point of which was a comparison of Arjun Singh, the Union human resource development minister with a eunuch. Rajmata Scindia was worse off. She could not hold back her tears of joy and could only say a small prayer that the temple be built. The Queen Mother of Gwalior, who had disowned her son Madhav Rao, had been a venerable figure in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In 1990, she tried to organise a large number of karsevaks to march to Ayodhya. Again in July 1992, when the sadhus were at a loss on how to react to the Supreme Court verdict against karseva, the Rajmata came to Ayodhya on behalf of the Sangh Parivar to appease them. Although she did manage to keep her daughter, Vasundhara Raje, in the BJP fold, the latter was not half as serious as her mother about the Ram temple. She was happy vacationing in Jaipur while the mother camped in Ayodhya. Even as the Rajmata was speaking, the war cry from the karseva site broke the quiet of the Ram Katha Kunj. All those who were cordoned off by RSS volunteers and were listening to the leaders stood up. Not that much could be seen from there. A number of them started bolting towards the Ram Deewar and a scuffle with the volunteers followed. Uma Bharti was immediately called upon to try and assuage the crowd, which was on the verge of a rampage. Even her razor-sharp voice got drowned in the din. Dumbfounded, she stood still, her half-finished lecture having cut no ice with the karsevaks. Seshadri, the second in command of the Sangh Parivar, whispered something into the ears of Singhal, who hastened down from the roof and, escorted by a dozen volunteers, walked out to the karseva site. It was too late by then. Singhal tried to brave the deluge of karsevaks by standing on the platform with arms spread out but that did not deter even one among the advancing mob. On top of that, a stream of invective was hurled at him: “Down with politics and hypocrisy”. The arrogant and undisputed leader stood helpless with a blank stare, with his dhoti almost coming off. I ran with the karsevaks past the PAC and CRPF jawans and stood in a corner, after having entered the structure. At least a couple of hundred karsevaks were already atop the dome. A few thousands more were storming in like an army of ants. All of them were armed with sticks, rods or trishuls. At least a hundred were carrying sledgehammers and shovels. Both the dome and the outer walls were under attack. In about ten minutes, half of the outer wall was reduced to a gaping hole. “Charge tear gas,” shouted DB Ray, the SP of Faizabad, and saw with a surprised look the PAC jawans, carrying tear gas shells, ambling away from the structure with an air of quiet resignation. The CRPF followed suit. One of the CRPF jawans whispered a friendly advice, “Out of this place. Quick, if you value your life”. Within moments, brickbats started raining from atop the dome. A CRPF jawan tried to protect us with his cane shield, but even then, a flying brickbat whistled past me and hit one of my fingers. My notebook flew from my hand. I somehow managed to retrieve it and never brought it out again on that fateful day. Sensing more trouble, I put the press card too in the pocket and took out the “Jai Shri Ram” hairband gifted by Swapan the previous night. I tied it around my neck like a bow tie, but soon realised that it was not going to serve as any talisman for me in this hour of crisis. To my horror, I saw a karsevak with a long bamboo pole chasing me. Thankfully, I knew the place well enough to bolt my way into the Sita Rasoi Bhavan. I was not alone there. The house was full of journalists and photographers, some of whom had lost their cameras or film rolls or video cassettes. Ajay Singh,  ’s photographer from the Lucknow bureau, was sitting with a sling around his right hand. He had for company our beloved Thapa from  , who was also injured. I went up to the roof. Debasis Bhattacharya of   and Avijit Lahiri of  were already there and so was Mohan Sahay of  . All three were unscathed, even though a portly lady of the Durga Vahini was targeting Mohan with brickbats in both her hands. What did Mohan do to be singled out as her target could not be readily ascertained. Fortunately, all of us escaped the wrath of the lady unhurt, including Mohan. A short distance from Sita Rasoi Bhavan, Ram Katha Kunj wore a deserted look, as the meeting was already over. LK Advani was sauntering on the roof with his head down and buried in his chest. Deepak Chopra, his personal secretary, and Pramod Mahajan, were standing with their hands on their heads, clearly displaying a sense of resignation. As Swapan approached Mahajan, he wailed, “This is a disaster. If this madness can’t be stopped right now, we are doomed.” In the meanwhile, all hell had broken loose inside the mosque. Spades, shovels and sledgehammers were raining on the dome. The blackish-green outer layer of the wall gave way to an earthen hue. Clouds of dust were billowing up and amidst the dust we saw many karsevaks, tumbling down the dome to the ground, like mangoes from the tree during a nor’wester. As Singhal returned from the war ground, the leaders of the Sangh Parivar got into a huddle in one corner of the roof, cordoned by carbine-toting securitymen from the National Security Guard (NSG) in their unmistakable sky-blue uniform. They would not let anyone reach anywhere close to the leaders. I heard Singhal giving up. “I have failed. Now you guys go and appeal,” he said. Hearing this, Seshadri, ran up to the stage and snatched the microphone from Acharya Dharmendra and started pleading with the masses. Advani and Mahajan went downstairs to listen to the 1pm news bulletin of “Akashvani”, expecting to hear the news of the dismissal of the Kalyan Singh-led BJP government of Uttar Pradesh. A series of pleas began. “We do not have the Mulayam Singh government but our own government in UP. We must cooperate with them and the police. Those who have entered the structure do come out immediately and take part in a peaceful karseva,” appealed Seshadri. All the other leaders, like Sadhvi Rithambara, Uma Bharti, LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, more or less repeated the plea in the same vein which went like this: “You have accomplished what you wanted to do. Now, please listen to us and climb down the dome and ensure that no one, especially women, children and the old get hurt.” Only Vinay Katiyar was more aggressive. “You have to listen to us and the sadhus. You have to climb down,” he thundered. As we anticipated, every plea fell on deaf ears. A large section of the crowd that was listening to the leaders at Ram Katha Kunj now got up and marched towards the mosque. The RSS volunteers, too, who were manning the walls from dawn, gave up their vigil. It was more important for them now to carry the injured karsevaks who fell from the tomb, to the first-aid room near the office. I suddenly found Prabhas Jain, chief photographer of  , writhing in pain in a corner of the roof. He was among the many reporters and photographers who dared to be close to the mosque. We brought this up with the Sangh leaders, but no one was in a mood to even listen. Even as scores of the injured were being brought in for treatment, the leaders again went into a huddle in front of the attic. Mahant Avaidyanath, the formidable MP from Gorakhpur, and a leading light of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, was also there. “All India Radio, in its 1pm bulletin, has said that the karseva is going on peacefully,” announced Pramod Mahajan. The news here was that the troublemakers were from Maharashtra and South India, and therefore could not make head or tail of the appeals made in chaste Hindi by the leaders. A volunteer came gasping and said, “Nothing can be heard there. Please go there and use the microphones,” he said. Promptly began a second phase of appeals. The leaders took their turn. Seshadri spoke in all four South Indian languages while Advani raised his voice to rebuke the karsevaks. Ashok Singhal, having regained his poise, thundered, “Can you hear me? This is Ashok Singhal.” The voices echoed on all the walls, but to no avail. After Singhal spoke, to my surprise, I saw a sadhu ranting his appeal in Bengali, my native tongue. “You mean, even Bengalis are there?” I asked him. “Of course, there are. You had doubts?” the sadhu said with pride. So, I told myself, all this worry about the security of the mosque was a hogwash. These people were eminently proud at what the karsevaks were doing. The leaders were speculating the identities of the karsevaks. “The first man atop the dome was from the prime minister’s constituency, Nandial,” said one. “None of them are our men. They have been packed to Ayodhya from Mumbai by Bal Thackeray,” said another. “Thackeray will take all the credit for today’s incident; just check tomorrow’s newspapers,” remarked Mahajan. The Rajmata clearly lost her patience. Grabbing the microphone, she shouted, “Get these people by their necks and pull them down.” Advani, with a binocular, was trying to figure out what exactly was wrong. As he removed those, I asked, “What did you see?” “Nothing except that hundreds are getting hurt,” he said. Till now, the injured were being carried by hand. Now, there were a few ambulances in place, running to and fro with the injured. All of a sudden, we saw that the two tombs that could be seen from the rooftop of Ram Katha Kunj had nobody atop them. Seshadri, who thought that the continuous appeals for three hours have had effect, suggested Advani that he should now congratulate the karsevaks. As Advani was coming down from the dais after his short vote of thanks, he confronted the horrible reality of the day. A frail sadhu had climbed up to the roof with the small Ramlala idol wrapped in his dusty shawl. He was almost in a fit of convulsion, shuddering frenziedly, his body having scratch marks all over. He removed the drape and showed Advani the idol. “Sir, one dome is being destroyed now. We could somehow save the Ramlala,” he gasped. The seasoned politician that Advani was, immediately realised that not only was the situation out of hand, but he was at his wits’ end as to how to reclaim normalcy. Silent and defeated, he climbed down the stairs. We asked for his reaction. “I have no information on the dismissal of the state government, but it seems a matter of time now. The central forces could be here any moment now,” he signed off. A while earlier, we were speculating the same. If in fact the state government did get dismissed and central forces took charge of the mosque to rein in the unruly mob, they could resort to any measure that they deemed fit. The euphoric karsevaks would not take it lying down and a clear consequence would be many deaths, we shuddered to think. As a matter of fact, we had heard from the grapevine around an hour ago that commandos of the Rapid Action Force of the CRPF wanted to take control of the situation and were on their way, but the district magistrate issued an edict to send them back to their barracks. The BJP government of UP was well in its constitutional rights to refuse the CRPF, and expectedly so, but if and when the government got dismissed, Delhi could give marching orders to the central forces. We all knew that the central government had a contingency plan in case of an eventuality like this. At least home minister SR Chavan kept saying so in Parliament for days in the run-up to this day. As such, twenty-eight battalions of CRPF jawans were already deployed at the Faizabad cantonment, notwithstanding vehement protests by Kalyan Singh. Of these, ten battalions comprised the RPF. We were confident that given the situation, the central government would not look by and bring these forces into action. However, when not a single jawan of the central forces appeared in the distant horizon even as the clock struck three, which coincided with the news of the fall of the dome on our right, the leaders started breathing easy. Tapananda Brahmachari, the Bengali sadhu, lectured me. “You live in ivory towers and live the lives of hedonists. How would you know the schemes of God Almighty? The fall of the mosque was inevitable.” Sadhvi Rithambara was brimming with pride, “Whatever happens, happens for good, whether you want it or not.” The leaders quietly accepted that the inevitable had happened and resigned themselves to their fate. Even as they went down to discuss the subsequent moves, the sadhus took centre stage. “Block all roads that lead to Ayodhya. Go and sit on the highways. Make sure that the central forces are kept at bay,” they thundered on the microphone. “Go to the temple and take your Prasad,” was the continuous instruction that Swami Dharmendra kept blaring. Prasad, in this case was not any food, but broken bricks of the Babri Masjid. A long line of disciples carrying bricks was streaming downstairs, even as the two other domes were being demolished. Chandan Mitra, then the associate editor of the  , suggested that we visit the site before it got completely demolished. Mahajan’s personal secretary assured us that he himself would take us down there and there was nothing to worry. Not that there was no cause for fear. As we made our way through the crowd towards the mosque, the choicest of invective greeted us. Nonetheless, we braved them and approached the mosque. It was a grisly sight. The zeal and fervour with which the karsevaks were taking part in the demolition sent a chill down our spines. Those who had no tools to use were scratching away like mad with their fingernails on the domes. A few young men tied a noose around the domes and were trying to pull them down. Chandan and Ruchira Gupta of  , climbed the hillock while the rest of us stayed down. Wherever we moved, a crowd encircled us. I looked in the front and saw an old man trying to come down the hillock. Wearing thick, dirty lenses, the octogenarian was carrying four bricks on his head. As I gaped at him, I saw two young men cradling Ruchira down to where we stood. She was in shock and could hardly speak. “A few karsevaks mistook Madam for a Muslim woman and pounced on her. It could have been a disaster if we were not around,” said one of the men. We chided Ruchira for her uncalled for bravery and came back to the roof of the office. What was relief half an hour ago when we left for the mosque had by now turned into celebrations. The sadhus were gambling on the exact time when the last of the domes would be razed to the ground. Sadhvi Rithambara removed Swami Dharmendra and took charge. “Ek dhakka aur do” (Give one more push), she roared. “Babri Masjid tod do” (demolish Babri Masjid), replied thousands gathered down below. As the last dome tumbled on to the ground at forty-nine minutes past four, all hell broke loose. Sadhvi jumped down from the stage and hugged Uma Bharti. And then, she kept hugging everyone whom she could find in her proximity. All the sadhus were dancing. The only man maintaining equanimity was BJP President Murli Manohar Joshi. “No questions and no answers. Please excuse me today,” the ashen-faced Joshi mumbled. The December afternoon was fast fading into dusk. I looked outside and saw many houses engulfed in flames. Thick black smoke was billowing from everywhere. None of the police officers had any clue of anything. A few know-all karsevaks explained, “The Muslims are torching their own houses so that they can blame it on us.” And yet, there was no inkling of any central intervention. With a smirk on his face, Ashok Singhal returned to the roof to a fresh round of embraces. Everyone was celebrating, including police officers. One of them enquired, “Have you noted the exact time when the mosque got demolished?” and added in the same breath, “You are fortunate. You just saw history being made.” The leader of RSS’s think tank, Sudarshan, who did not take part in the unbridled celebrations, was sitting quietly on a chair nearby. When asked how he would explain what had happened over the past five hours, he replied in fluent Bengali, “Just one thing. Today’s incident proved that history is not made, it happens.” Whether it was a historic moment or a historic blunder is not something I could have dwelt on then. My only concern then was how to get my copy through to my office in Kolkata. Chandan advised me against depending on the Central Telegraph Office of Faizabad and suggested that I should go back to Lucknow. “For all you know, the telephone and telegraph lines may well be snapped just to prevent news from reaching the outside world,” he said, “just as they did after Operation Blue Star in Golden Temple in 1984.” However, nothing like that happened. It was important to get a reaction from Advani before I left the place. The NSG commando who was manning the door, smeared our foreheads with vermilion. He said triumphantly, it was no ordinary stuff, but extracted out of the forehead of the Ramlala idol, which was now in safe custody. We went inside into complete darkness. Two youths, sitting on a wooden platform in a corner room, were trying desperately to tune in to the news from a transistor set. The electricity connections had been snapped at the time when the domes were being pulled down, they informed. They also informed that Advani was in the next room, trying to get in touch with Delhi via telephone, in candlelight, and was all by himself. Advani emerged after a few minutes. For the past eight years that I had known him closely, I had never seen such a nervous Advani before. It seemed that he could not digest the wild celebrations that were happening right above his head. At least, till then.  Has the UP government been sacked?  No, not yet. However, Kalyan Singh telephoned me twice to seek my permission to offer his resignation. I have advised him against it, because if he does, central forces would immediately take over and we will see bloodbath. But by now, he might have resigned. By the time you reach Lucknow, the resignation would most probably have been accepted too.  When do you plan to return to Delhi?  Till this morning, my plan was to take the evening flight from Lucknow. But now I must stay here for a couple of days more. I cannot leave all these people to their destiny.  Could you get in touch with Delhi?  I have been trying for long, but cannot get through.  How would you react to today’s incident?  Unfortunate and regrettable. A few hours later, after returning to Lucknow, we came to know that Advani changed his mind and left Ayodhya in the evening itself. Many days later, on his release from prison, Advani told journalists that he did not regret the demolition of the Babri Masjid. What he regretted was that he could not gauge the mood of the people. I was not surprised at this volte face. After all, the man was in realpolitik and had his stakes in place. As we came out to the last rays of the setting December sun, speculating on whether Chandan’s new Maruti Gypsy car could escape today’s onslaught, Anju Gupta, the demure yet smart police officer with a walkie-talkie in one hand and a stick in another, met us. She drove out the crowd and whispered into Chandan’s ears, “Two photographers have been in hiding since morning in a nearby room. Mind taking them with you?” We would have been glad to do so, but a small car like his would not have been able to accommodate those two, over and above the eight that we already were, Chandan explained. Anju understood and with a shrug said, “Don’t worry. I shall take care of them.” One of the two photographers was Nitin Rai, our colleague from  . Nitin told us later that had it not been for Anju, he could have been killed that day. When the rest of the police force was enjoying the manhandling of reporters and photographers, the only man around was this little woman. When we reached the main road, we found, to our surprise and relief, that Chandan’s car stood just as he had left it there in the morning. Not a scratch or a dent. The car might have escaped the madness, but not so lucky were the local Muslims. Every Muslim house was torched. A few matador vans, auto rickshaws and car tyres were also burning. The karsevaks did exactly as the leaders asked them to. They blocked the roads by felling logs and turning asphalt drums. Around these blockades the karsevaks were dancing like mad men. As we dodged and swerved to make our way through the flames and the maddening sea of humanity, shouts of “Abhi toh yeh sirf jhaanki hain, Mathura, Kashi baaki hain” (This is just the beginning/we will now turn our attention to Mathura and Banaras) filled the evening sky. Curfew was already imposed in Faizabad. As we reached our hotel, Shaan-E-Awadh, we could see for ourselves how scribes had been beaten up by karsevaks. I met Alok Mitra, my photographer colleague. He looked devastated. “Not only was I beaten to a pulp, but lost everything — two cameras and cash worth nine thousand rupees. They even snatched my gold chain,” he cried. I had no words to console him. In the hotel lobby, there were at least fifty scribes from across the globe, all with sunken faces. We learnt that Peter Hynes Lane, of  , had suffered a serious head injury and was taken to the hospital. He was beaten with an iron rod. Former editor of  , SP Singh, stood next to the reception counter. “In my twenty years as a journalist, I have never seen such manhandling of journalists,” he sounded shell-shocked. But Bob Drolin, the   correspondent, who had come to Ayodhya, for the first time, wrote in  , perhaps what was uppermost in every journalist’s mind that day — “Any journalist who was not scared today was stupid”.

517,Suvojit Chattopadhyay,"The whispers have started: “If not Narendra Modi, then who?” Columnists have started warning us that if we fail to elect Narendra Modi back to power with an absolute majority, we could be in for a spell of “ ”. Should this alarm us? Not quite. On the contrary, if the  in 2019, it will be a great moment for our democracy. A government that has little to show in terms of concrete achievements, and one that pulled every trick in the book to damage constitutional values does not deserve a second chance. This is not a prediction, but an argument.   It is time to revisit the basic fallacies in the Modi story. The Modi story was one manufactured as much by the electronic media, as by the ""enthusiastic cadre"" of the party working tirelessly on the ground and on social media. It should have been amply clear to anyone who really cared that what Narendra Modi really offered was essentially a xenophobic vision for India, garnished by tokenistic sound bites on development and Mahatma Gandhi. Positioning the debate in 2014 as one between a state-led model of development through entitlements and private sector-led model of fast growth has been laid bare for everyone to see. First of all, there are sectors where the state’s presence is non-negotiable, such as social safety nets, basic health and elementary education. In these sectors, an unwilling state has dragged its feet on both policy-making and implementation, with disastrous results. Meanwhile, the state has expanded its reach to hitherto unparalleled levels through Aadhaar. Individual liberty has been curbed on several fronts. “Minimum government” is a joke. With  , GSPC and  , no one should harbour any illusions any longer of Narendra Modi being above corruption. This should have never been a surprise, given that in the much-hyped ""Gujarat model"", extractive private-enterprises were promoted at the expense of people and the environment. But this, along with the blatant use of social media to promote false propaganda both on the economy and society, belies any claims that one may make of the BJP being a mascot of ""good governance"". In the five years that this government would have been in power, we would have regressed on all fronts while the fruits of this power have been accumulated by the RSS and its affiliates. In the past four years, the economy has been run to the ground, and if things don’t look as bad as they might have, we have only low oil prices to thank. This should worry even those who couldn’t care less about the current establishment’s insidious social and cultural agenda. No wonder then, the scare-mongering has started. India apparently doesn’t deserve a coalition government. Those that argue this are basically claiming that a country as diverse as ours deserves a homogenous single-narrative government. Bizarrely, supporters of the current government are loathe to even acknowledge the successes of the previous BJP-led government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The prime minister’s own intemperate remarks recently in Parliament have left no one in doubt that the ruling party is desperate. While economic performance tends to be cyclical, the vicious campaign of hate and the normalisation of violence seen in the past four years have no parallel. That this cannot take place without active sanction of the state is a foregone conclusion. What the government has attempted to do is to cultivate a level of plausible deniability around the actions that it silently patronises. Thus, we see to this day, the government accepts no responsibility for the actions of its ideological affiliates, instead terming them as the ""irresponsible fringe"". This remains a handy polarisation tool, one can make an appearance prior to every election of any significance. It is also important ask now - what have we lost in this era of a dominant one-party rule at the Centre? Did we get a ""strong"" government? The hallmark of this government running with an absolute majority in Parliament has been the deification of a single leader. An authoritarian leader may harbour fantasies of being a saviour of 1.3 billion people - but as we have witnessed so far, this is as unreal as it can get. This is also why the prime minister has been heard falling back on state governments and previous central governments to share the blame for big and painful reforms such as the Goods and Services Tax. No democracy needs an almighty leader, and contrary to hype, this has not yielded sound far-sighted economic policy. On the other hand, it has exposed the pitfalls of empowering a narrow power structure that is unwilling to seek out credible counsel. It has also revealed for all to see, the danger of bringing leaders to power whose hunger for political power and self-aggrandisement is all-consuming, even at the expense of core constitutional institutions. Worst of all, the embodiment of communalism in the top leadership (and the wider RSS-sponsored eco-system) has inspired many an act of violence and terrorism. Is this the absolute majority dividend we ought to be grateful for? Would a coalition government have done better? It is obviously hard to tell, but competing pressures from coalition constituents would have put a lid on the brazenness that we have seen playing out in public life. Also, a ""strong government"" is one that secures a wide consensus and represents all sections of the population. The general elections of 2019 would be the time to demand accountability. India deserves better, and we should not let ourselves be distracted by alarmists who are raising the bogey of unsettled coalition politics.",2018-02-15,"BJP,Coalition,Modi,Lok Sabha elections",Why everybody feels India is heading back to a coalition government in 2019,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/lok-sabha-elections-2019-coalition-modi-bjp-rss-minimum-government-joke/story/1/22381.html
518,Madhuri Danthala,"February 15, the birth anniversary of Susan B Anthony, a 19  century women’s rights activist who championed the women’s suffrage movement, is an apt occasion to ruminate over the Women’s Reservation bill. The bill, also known as the Constitution (108th Amendment) Bill, 2008, seeks to ensure that 33 per cent of the seats in the Lok Sabha as well as in state legislative Assemblies are reserved for women. Introduced by the UPA government in 2008, it was passed in the Rajya Sabha, but the Lok Sabha hadn’t voted on it and it therefore lapsed after the Congress-led UPA government lost power in 2014. Had it been enacted, seats would have been reserved on a rotation basis with no seat being reserved more than once in three consecutive general elections. Sadly, there has been no attempt to empower women politically since the bill lapsed. India already has the ignominy of being ranked 148  in terms of representation of women in executive government. We have a mere 11.8 per cent women in the Lok Sabha as against a global average of about 22.8 per cent women in national legislatures (as of June 2016). These figures only indicate the dismal state of women’s empowerment, especially in roles that involve decision-making. Numerous studies have indicated that women’s leadership style tends to be more inclusive and risk averse. This augurs well for any society to attain inclusive and sustainable development. For instance, many scholars are of the view that had there been more women in the top echelons of the corporate field, the global financial crisis of 2008 may have been averted. Giving credence to this view is a report by the UNDP titled, ""Corruption, Accountability and Gender: Understanding the Connections"", implies that having more women representatives could lead to lesser corruption. To understand the correlation between gender parity in politics and development, one must look at the Nordic countries. All the Nordic countries are in the top 10 list of women representatives in Parliament, with Sweden accounting for about 44.7 per cent women in their legislature. This is reflected in their national policies known for being inclusive and gender sensitive. Some of their policies and schemes include, mandatory paternity leave, alongside maternity leave, and post-maternity re-entry programmes. Meanwhile, since 2008, in Norway, it is statutorily mandated that all  . Even in India, there is strong evidence to indicate that where women are involved, there is better development. The United Nations Women, in its website cites research which has revealed that women-led panchayats, had 62 per cent higher drinking water projects than in those led by men. The website also states that a causal relationship was observed in the number of women representatives in local bodies in Norway and better child welfare. It is the prospect of having such provisions in India that should dominate our public discourse and electoral debates. Sadly, our discourse is rife with mudslinging, cheap personal jibes, slander and the like. Rather than debating about the places of worship leaders visit, or the promises of subsidies for pilgrimages, we must be debating about ways to ensure inclusive and sustainable development. Given such a bleak scenario, it is encouraging that at a recent interaction with people, Rahul Gandhi had reiterated what he has been saying for long - that the Congress party under his leadership will ensure more women are brought into the political system. During the interaction, he cited a recent meeting he held with party leaders from a state where a panel of 15 members that discussed women’s empowerment, ironically, had only one woman representative. Instead of indulging in the usual meaningless political jibes, it would be in the best interests of the nation if all parties mulled over this, as the situation is unlikely to be much different from what Rahul Gandhi illustrated. Since all parties agree that women’s empowerment is a matter of paramount importance, they should come together and ensure there is gender parity in their parties. Further, it would be in the best interest of India’s development that all parties put aside their differences and pass the women’s reservation bill. Surely, it cannot be such a difficult thing to do when every party agrees that we need more women in the (legislative) Houses.",2018-02-15,"Women's Rights,Parliament,Women's Reservation Bill",Why the women’s reservation bill is important now more than ever,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/womens-reservation-bill-parliament-33-percent-reservation/story/1/22375.html
519,Dev Ankur Wadhawan,"About 10 months ago, in April 2017, there was a spring in the step of Rajasthan chief minister  .   had turned into a prestige issue and Vasundhara took it upon herself to win the seat and how. She camped and campaigned at the Dholpur Palace for several days, travelling across the constituency, overseeing the campaigning, for which almost all her retinues were pressed into service. The party managed to secure the seat as   beat the Congress by a record margin of over 38,000 votes. The government tom-tommed the victory and claimed it was a reflection of people's confidence in her leadership and BJP's model of governance in the run-up to the Assembly elections in 2018. Cut to February 2018. The result of the three by-elections, including that for Ajmer and Alwar Lok Sabha constituencies, is out. Vasundhara Raje dispensation would not have expected a worse result. It has been left cutting a sorry figure as in the final year of the government's tenure the voters in these constituencies have overwhelmingly expressed their lack of confidence in her leadership and what her dispensation has managed to achieve or rather not achieve in her four years at the helm. The ""Rani"", facing flak for her domineering style of functioning, has her political career on the line like never before. Speculation about her and some of her trusted lieutenants in the government making way has been rife since the results came. Inaccessibility, disconnect from the masses, unwillingness or inability to address the pressing issues of unemployment, lack of development, price rise, being petty-minded are some of the charges flying thick and fast against her. Murmurs of discontent against her from within the party are no longer just murmurs. They have grown louder and are likely to become shriller as Assembly elections draw nearer this year. Party leaders have been worrying about their fate if the current leadership carries on in the run-up to the polls this year. On a day the chief minister presented the final state Budget of her current term in office, a controversial audio conversation purportedly of a party MLA from Alwar was leaked. A voice believed to be that of the MLA is heard saying he has informed the party that results will be disastrous if the current leadership is not changed. Whether it was the Narendra Modi wave, the anti-incumbency against Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan and the Manmohan Singh dispensation at the Centre or general disenchantment against the Congress during 2013 Assembly elections and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP's honeymoon period in Rajasthan is well and truly over. This has already set warning bells within the BJP, both at the state and central level. Here are some humbling facts the BJP's top brass has been chewing upon during the last few days after the defeat in the  : The BJP's candidate from Ajmer constituency lost to Congress' candidate by over 84,000 votes. It is a seat the BJP had won by a margin of more than 1.70 lakh votes in 2014 Lok Sabha polls as Sachin Pilot suffered a humiliating defeat. In Alwar, the ruling party's candidate lost by a massive margin of over 1.96 lakh votes. It is a seat the BJP had won by close to 2.84 lakh votes in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. In Mandalgarh Assembly by-poll, the Congress candidate defeated the BJP's candidate by over 12,000 votes. This despite the fact that the Congress was in a tight spot in the constituency as a party leader decided to contest as Independent, thereby cutting into the party's votes. On February 12, as ""Rani"" stood inside the Vidhan Sabha, looking at her Budget speech, one which made one promise after another, ranging from farm loan waiver to loan for 50,000 families under Bhairon Singh Shekhawat Antyoday Swarojgar Yojna, much of the old vanity surrounding her seemed to be a thing of the past. Electoral defeats can truly be the most humbling experience for a politician but whether it came too late for Vasundhara Raje or will she still be able to course correct is something only time can tell.",2018-02-13,"Vasundhare Raje,Sachin Pilot,Rajasthan politics,Rajasthan by-polls",Future looks grim for Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan politics,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajasthan-by-polls-vasundhare-raje-rajasthan-politics-assembly-elections-sachin-pilot/story/1/22331.html
520,Dinesh C Sharma,"In the past few weeks, many new policies related to the health sector have been announced, the foremost being the National Health Protection Scheme unveiled in the Budget. Though details of this scheme have not yet been revealed, it will be a government-funded insurance plan to cover hospitalisation costs at secondary and tertiary care levels for poor families. The National Medical Council (NMC) Bill, aimed at bringing in a new medical regulatory authority, is also being reviewed by Parliament. Doctors have taken to the street against this move. Another health-related initiative is the draft of the new pharmaceutical policy. Amidst all this, the Niti Aayog has issued a Health Index that ranks the performance of states in the health sector based on indicators like total fertility rate, maternal mortality rate, status of health personnel, etc, but overlooks crucial indicators like public investment in health. It appears the government and the institutions concerned are treating all these steps in isolation. This amounts to a piecemeal approach to health. We need a comprehensive blueprint for the overhaul of the health sector. Take, for instance, the health protection scheme. In the absence of a policy format and clear objectives, any such ""insurance only"" scheme may not yield desired results and prove to be counter-productive like similar schemes implemented earlier by Union and state governments. Most such schemes have led to a rise in unnecessary procedures and malpractices, and not contributed to better health outcomes. High incidence of costly procedures like stenting, heart surgeries and hysterectomies have been reported in states that funded health insurance. Shifting the government’s responsibility to the private sector without necessary quality and pricing checks would be dangerous. The Clinical Establishment Act — which most states have not implemented — and the NMC Bill, which is pending in the Parliament, are supposed to address these issues. Another interrelated issue is the drug policy. India is fast losing its advantage of cheap drugs, as the domestic drug industry is becoming dependent on China for the supply of bulk drugs for manufacturing even essential medicines because we have systematically neglected public bulk drug firms. At a time when the world is making a gradual shift to Universal Health Coverage (UHC), we are moving towards a private sector cum-insurance-led health system. UHC means providing a minimum set of services for all citizens. For this, countries need to strengthen their health systems and involve private sector wherever necessary. The UHC approach in India is visible in the provision of free ART (Antiretroviral therapy) to people with HIV, free medication to TB patients and the neighbourhood clinic scheme in Delhi. All these are government-led schemes but involve private providers. If UHC is the goal, then it can’t be achieved via insurance alone. We need to strengthen primary care for all. There is no substitute for greater public investment in the health sector.

521,Nivedita Khandekar,"Would Dr Harsh Vardhan, India’s minister for environment, forests and climate change, also a medical practitioner since before he became the central minister, certify a person with haemoglobin level of 8g/dL (gram/deciLitre), or for that matter even 10g/dL as healthy? Most likely not. But apparently, as per the doctor minister, the same may not be true for forest cover, especially the type of forest and forest cover density — important parametres for assessing the health of our forests, the country’s veritable lungs that keep us alive. On Monday, February 12, 2018, the doctor and his team that released the India State of Forest Report 2017, patted their backs for an apparent increase in the forest and tree cover only and largely chose to ignore the weak points as large parts of India lost very dense forests, as was evident from comparison with the previous assessment.   ** The total forest cover as per current assessment is 7,08,273 sqkm, which is 21.54 per cent of the geographic area of the country. ** The tree cover is estimated to be 93,815 sqkm (9.38 million ha), which is 2.85 per cent of the geographical area. ** The total forest and tree cover is 8,02,088 sqkm (80.20 million ha), which is 24.39 per cent of the geographical area. ** There has been an increase of 6,778 sqkm of forest cover at the national level. (After considering the changes during two assessments – 2015 (updated) and 2017). ** Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala have contributed by an increase of 2,141 sqkms, 1,101 sqkm and 1,043 sqkm, respectively. ** There is an increase of 1,243 sqkm in tree cover compared to the 2015 assessment. But a closer look at the  tells us that not all forests are healthy. It sounds more like number jugglery. Even when very dense forest (VDF), that is all land with tree canopy density of 70 per cent and above, increased by 9,525 sqkm from 2015 to 2017, the moderately dense forest (MDF), that is all lands with tree canopy density of 40 per cent and more but less than 70 per cent, decreased by 4,421sqkm. States such as Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha and Andaman and Nicobar Islands have shown decrease in the VDF category. In the MDF category, it is the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Telangana, Uttarakhand, West Bengal that have shown a negative change. A footnote for Jammu and Kashmir in all cases and for Odisha at another place just add to the gloomy picture. For Jammu and Kashmir, the note reads “includes Jammu and Kashmir area outside LoC that is under illegal occupation of Pakistan and China”. For Odisha, in the table showing “Recorded Forest Areas (RFAs) in States and UTs”, a footnote mentions: “RF (reserved forest) in Odisha includes 9,175 sqkms of proposed RF, PF (protected forest) includes 15,117 sqkms revenue forest/deemed forest and 191 sqkms of private forest.” Bah! So much for quality of forests! As rightly pointed out by this June 2016  titled “Why Defining a 'Forest' in India Is Harder Than It Sounds (And Why That Matters)”, the “Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has been involved in a tussle with the Tribal Affairs Ministry over the question of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) as well as the rights of forest-based communities. The Environment Ministry has been an instrumental part of this battle by reinterpreting the FRA and paving the road to doing away with consent, on multiple levels, from ‘gram sabhas’ (village-level governments) before chopping down India’s traditional forests”. The debate is not settled yet. What is more is minister Harsh Vardhan said, “We are 10th in the list of top forest cover countries. When the world over, there has been a decreasing trend in forest cover, India has witnessed an increase. The other nine countries have a population density of about 150 persons compared to India’s 350 (population density). This is important.” But as is very clear from a   by D Venkateswarlu, an IFS officer from Jharkhand, as part of his assignment for his course at TERI University, each country has its own definitions of what constitutes forests. The European Commission has defined forestland as having at least 20 per cent canopy closure (10 per cent in the Mediterranean forests) and a minimum area of 0.5 ha (1 ha = 0.01Sq. KM); Brazil defines forest as an area of land greater than one hectare, with more than 30 per cent canopy cover and a minimum tree height of five metres; USA’s Forest Service says forest land includes land at least 10 per cent of which is stocked by trees of any size, or land formerly having had such tree cover that will be naturally or artificially regenerated; Canada says forest land is constituted by areas of land where tree canopies cover more than 10 per cent of the total area and the trees, when mature, can grow to a height of more than five metres. China, on the other hand, says forest is “a land having a minimum area 0.67 ha, minimum crown cover of 20 per cent and a minimum tree height of two metres”. Clearly, even when India finds a place amid the first 10 countries, by definition, our forests do not compare qualitatively with other forests. But this fact about what is it that they call a forest does not find mention in the current report. Most worrisome is the situation in high altitudes and northeastern areas: ** The total forest cover in the northeastern region is 171306 sqkm, which is 65.34 per cent of its geographical area in comparison to the national forest cover of 21.54 per cent. ** The current assessment shows a decrease of forest cover to the extent of 630 sqkms in the NE region. ** All altitude zones above 1,000 metres (approximately 3,800 feet) have registered a small decrease in forest cover as against those below 1,000 metres, which show an increase. As many as six states of the northeastern region showed a negative change as compared to 2015 assessment. Arunachal Pradesh (-190), Meghalaya (-116), Mizoram (-531), Nagaland (-450), Sikkim (-9) and Tripura (-164) showed negative change while only Assam and Manipur showed positive changes. When it came to the alarmingly decreasing numbers from the northeastern states, Dr Harsh Vardhan said: “The NE already has 70 per cent of forest cover. We will go into the nitty-gritty and look into the reasons and all positive, corrective measures would be taken.”He also said, “We will treat it as a blessing in disguise and deal with it accordingly.” But then, neither did the minster nor the Forest Survey of India (FSI)  have a clear idea as to what could be the exact reason. Saibal Dasgupta, DG, FSI, said, “Jhoom cultivation can be one of the reasons for the decrease in forest cover in the NE. We will try to increase the livelihood options (for the people of the NE).” When asked if the increasing rate of development projects in the northeast that need cutting down or drowning of forest – such as highways, hydropower projects or industries, could be a reason – the officer, however, said the department did not have segregated data on diverted forest land and land under jhoom cultivation. The picture is especially scary as most of the forests in the hill states of northeast belong to indigenous communities, leading to the obvious question: who is usurping them? Now, to understand what “a small decrease in forest cover” means: (Forest cover in Altitude zones (Area in sqkm)) Clearly, what the report and even the minister termed as “small decrease” for areas above 1,000 metres (3,800 feet and above) is not as small as they want you to believe. The areas above 4,000 feet are the Himalayan ranges that give birth to the majority of our rivers. Forests are vital for the survival of these rivers and the negative decrease (- 217, -193, -76 and -99) for all ranges above 1,000 metres should set the alarm bells ringing in the Himalayan states. They are already bearing the brunt of climate change witnessing decreased snowfall in winters, increased temperatures and drier atmosphere every passing year. Water bodies inside forests and bamboo find a separate mention in the India State of Forests Report 2017 for the first time. Acknowledging that “forests play a vital role in water conservation and improve the water regime in the area”, different state forest departments besides plantation and protection also undertake steps to improve water conservation through different interventions such as building check dams, vegetation barriers, percolation ponds, contour trenches etc under various central and state government schemes. As per the latest assessment based on comparison of satellite images from 2005 and 2015, water bodies inside forest cover have increased by 2,647 sqkm during the last decade. Maharashtra (432 sqkm), Gujarat (428 sqkm) and Madhya Pradesh (389 sqkm) are the top three states that have seen a spike in water bodies within forest areas. Nearly all the states have shown progress in terms of the growth of water bodies, the report said. After recently changing the definition of bamboo as “grass”, compared to the earlier definition of “tree”, the government plans to emphasise more on bamboo’s ecological and economic value. For the first time, bamboo finds mention as a separate chapter of India State of Forest Report 2017 even though it was always an integral part of National Forest Inventory.

522,Arindam De,"So Goa minister Vijai Sardesai thinks that north Indians are ""scum of the earth""? Urging the state government to attract more foreign tourists and upper-class Indian tourists, the town and country planning minister said: ""We cannot make Goa another Gurgaon. The north Indian states are responsible for the problems that Goa has today. The people coming from those states actually want to recreate Haryana in Goa. “Today we have almost six times population of Goa coming as tourists... Those tourists are not top-end tourists, they are also the scum of the earth.""  According to Sardesai, the heavy influx of north Indian tourists was making it difficult for the state to address the issue of garbage. Well, the only thing infuriated north Indians and Goa aficionados can say is that the   shows the minister needs to clear the cobwebs from his head. Ruling coalitions across the country, in their bid to cling on to power, often enlist individuals or organisations that show scant respect for the country and its citizens. Nor do they respect the ideals that define the leading party. Such elements are neither friends nor allies, but opportunists. (Sardesai's Goa Forward Party is a coalition partner in the BJP-led government.)    It's true that on an average, a foreign tourist does spend almost two-and-a-half times the amount spent by an ordinary domestic tourist. But ministers blaming fellow countrymen or even foreign migrants for ruining their state is not just unfair but uncalled for. In June 2016, the then deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza had said that migrants are responsible for the  . Of course, he was echoing the feelings of the then CM Laxmikant Parsekar who blamed Nigerians for their lifestyle and attitude. Their statements had seen the opposition calling out the BJP-led government's bias towards Africans. It is not a secret that the foreign drug lords have been operating with impunity in Goa. Once limited to the north, the drug menace has spread to south Goa too, and intel reports suggest that the drug net is only expanding in the area. Of course, this is not to say that all   are responsible for it, but the fact that   himself has spoken on the issue deserves some attention. But can people like Sardesai blame north Indians for ""all the problems that Goa is facing today""? What about his ""foreign and high-end tourists""? As for the minister's other statement that north Indians are gobbling up everything - land and properties - I have this to say. Well, they indeed are because everything is up for grabs. Goa is a beautiful place and whatever is on sale - land and property - will be bought. Domestic tourists are not   land from Goans. No one from Haryana is pushing Goans out of their properties. On the contrary, people are buying properties in Goa at prices usually higher than what the locals would pay.  That an NDA ally deems it right to say that "" "" coming to Goa are ruining the paradise that Goa is, it is not just an insult to the poor but north Indian members of Sardesai's coalition partner, BJP, too.",2018-02-10,"Vijai Sardesai,North Indians,Tourists,Goa",Why Goa minister Vijai Sardesai thinks poor domestic tourists are ‘scum of the earth’,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/goa-minister-vijai-sardesai-domestic-north-indian-tourists-scum-of-earth-parrikar-drugs/story/1/22295.html
523,TS Sudhir,"There was a reason why  , without making any direct reference to actor-turned-Congress leader Divya Spandana's tweet on the prime minister, made his point clear by saying that character assassination of any individual was not right. At a public meeting in Bangalore last week, Narendra Modi had said farmers were his ""top priority"" and went on to expand ""TOP"" as tomato, onion, potato. In response,  , alias Ramya, took a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on ""POT"", which was seen as a reference to cannabis. (She is the head of Congress social media cell.)  A subsequent clarification that she meant ""POT"" - potato, onion, tomato - understandably did not find many takers, and the BJP went on the offensive claiming the tweet was derogatory to the PM. Siddaramaiah said, ""I have countered Modi's allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally.""  Ahead of the elections in Karnataka, this is one of the main worries for the Congress. It wants to avoid any Congress leader doing a Mani Shankar Aiyar and give Modi the opening he is looking for. In Aiyar, Modi has had a dependable electoral ""ally"". During the Gujarat election campaigning, Modi exploited the dinner Aiyar had hosted for his Pakistani guests and suggested that the Indian guests, which included former prime minister Manmohan Singh, were hatching a conspiracy. When Aiyar called Modi a ""neech aadmi"" to accuse him of playing dirty politics, Modi said it was a casteist slur and alleged Aiyar had gone to Pakistan to offer ""supari"" for him. In 2014, Aiyar had inadvertently helped the BJP to go on the offensive when he smugly offered space for Modi to set up a tea stall. Modi went to town, interpreting it as an insult to his past vocation, and the arrogance of the party [Congress] in power. Ever since he took charge of the party, Rahul Gandhi has maintained that he and his party will follow a certain propriety even when mud is thrown at rivals in the heat and dust of elections. There is no booklet available that lists out the dos and don'ts, but it seems in the Congress book, everyone but Modi is fair game. So the name of Arun Jaitley can be changed by Gandhi to  . The BJP has returned the compliment by branding the Siddaramaiah government a 10 per cent government, insinuating that it is corrupt. This reluctance to attack the PM at a personal level is more to do with fear factor than real respect. Political strategists point out the example of Arvind Kejriwal who at one point in time, would not tire of dragging Modi into just about every issue concerning Delhi. So much so that it started to look like the Delhi CM suffered from a Modi-phobia. And the more he attacked the PM, his own stature started diminishing with even those who had voted him to power in Delhi, asking why he does not let his work do the talking instead of venting his spleen through Twitter everyday. Which is why it will be interesting to note how the Siddaramaiah versus Modi battle plays out on Twitter. For the past one week, the Karnataka CM has taken on the PM, countering his allegations with facts. This has BS Yeddyurappa, the BJP's chief ministerial face, feeling left out as he expected Karnataka to be a Yeddyurappa versus Siddaramaiah fight. On numerous occasions, he has tried to draw the CM into an argument by responding to his tweets. Siddaramaiah's effort to target Modi directly runs the risk of going wrong for two reasons. One, people like to see a battle between equals, and it would seem that Siddaramaiah is punching above his weight by taking on the PM. Two, it will take just one slip by Siddaramaiah for his rivals, including Modi, to use that to counter attack him. Similarly, the approach of actor Prakash Raj is fraught with risk. For the past many months, Raj has been speaking out against both Modi and Amit Shah, accusing them of being anti-Hindu. If Raj campaigns against right-wing hardline elements in Karnataka, as he may do, it will obviously be seen as helping the Congress. It is a double-edged sword as any kind of vitriol that is seen as a personal attack, could boomerang. It is here that the Nitish Kumar strategy is spoken of as a better template. He made the Bihar 2015 election as a ""Bihari versus Bahari"" duel, positioning himself and Lalu Yadav as sons of the soil versus the two outsiders in Modi and Amit Shah. So Siddaramaiah's emphasis on Kannadiga pride as a counterpoint to the nationalistic approach of BJP, would be a better electoral ploy. Karnataka has always been seen by the BJP as its gateway to south India. The party made a mess of the chance it got in 2008, with Yeddyurappa who was the CM, getting embroiled in corruption cases. It would now want to make amends. With Karnataka being the largest state under Congress control, the stakes are high for both the parties. Enough reason for politicians to stoop as low.  ",2018-02-10,"Karnataka,Divya Spandana,Rahul Gandhi,Congress","In Karnataka, no one dares to upset Modi, not even Congress",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-congress-rahul-gandhi-karnataka-siddaramaiah-arun-jaitley-divya-spandana/story/1/22296.html
524,Omair Ahmad,"The recent Gujarat state elections were marked by the BJP and its supporters campaigning against Muslims, and the Congress  . The one candidate who did speak on this issue was  , an independent candidate supported by the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, fighting for a seat reserved for Dalits. Weeks ago in  , Uttar Pradesh, as rioters disrupted a Republic Day hoisting of flags by Muslims and called them “Pakistanis”, the one legislator to raise the issue as one of fundamental rights was  , representing a regional party with one MP in the Lok Sabha. His ability to influence national politics is next to non-existent. The marginalisation of Muslims in national politics is almost complete. Their position is that of the eternal stuffed toy, to be vilified at will, with almost no legislator willing to speak of the fundamental right to life of more than 170 million people in the world’s largest democracy. The virtual political disenfranchisement of Muslims in India is a corrosive problem, with potentially catastrophic impact on Indian democracy, but there are no Muslim political leaders of note to address this. At such points, there is the usual lament about the fact that Muslims have not been able to produce a leader of the calibre of Abdul Kalam Azad, India’s first education minister, and who was elected to the post of President of the Indian National Congress, on par with Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. What these lamentations ignore is that Azad was a politician of pre-Partition India. The loss of the large Muslim population in Punjab and East Pakistan/Bangladesh meant that the national base of Muslim politics was vastly reduced after Independence. The Muslims who would have voted for the Congress and a Congress Muslim – bear in mind that in the 1937 elections, the Congress won 25 of the 59 seats reserved for Muslims, including all 15 from the then-North West Frontier Province – were gone (the Unionist Party in undivided Punjab won 101 seats, almost on par with the Muslim League total of 106, and its base was largely the part now in Pakistan). They had to, and still do, navigate politics in different states. With the loss of large mass bases, Partition meant that there was literally no state in the Indian Union where Muslims accounted for a majority, apart from Jammu & Kashmir. Given that J&K accounts for one per cent of the Indian population, and the role of Chief Minister of J&K has basically been reduced to asking, “How high?” when the Centre says, “Jump”, its impact on national politics is hardly worth considering. In the rest of India, the chance of a Muslim party dominating a state, or even playing a major part in its politics, was doomed from the start. In the first-past-the-post elections that we have (we can see from Germany or South Africa that proportional representation better manages diverse polities), a candidate usually needs between 30 to 35 percent of the vote-share to win. There are almost no constituencies in India where Muslims have that much of the population, even if they were not factionalised among themselves to begin with. Lastly is the issue of finance. After Partition, not only did Muslims no longer have a mass base, they lost many of their most prosperous community members, with only a very few of the elite remaining. These were deeply disconnected from the conditions and concerns of, and often in exploitative relationships with, their poorer brethren. Today, if Muslims are found on the national landscape, their wealth is largely tied to the arts – and the  like Aamir Khan or Shah Rukh Khan when they question anti-Muslim rhetoric or actions highlight exactly how precarious their position is, despite their fame or success. Given these conditions, post-Independence Muslim politics has been dominated by two types of Muslims, the “sarkari mussalman”, who kowtowed to the ruling dispensation in return for a share of the spoils, or the “unlettered mullah”, who spoke of Muslim concerns as religious difference, as distinct from the national agenda. In both these cases, what these politicians offered to the ruling parties is a vote base that they could energise, whether by patronage or polarisation. Neither offered an investment in the principles of the Constitution, in fundamental rights, in the life of the nation, in issues of poverty alleviation and sustainable development, in deepening democracy, and the importance of federalism and the identity of regions. Why would they? They were in the business of being doorkeepers, and if doors were easily accessible to all, their own value would plummet. This corrosive failure is most clearly seen in Kashmir, where Muslims have largely adopted a “nationalistic” line that is deeply at odds with Constitutional values. The cost of this has been that a political issue has been handled as a communal issue. Today, as many of the same features of misgovernance in Kashmir find their way into the national agenda, Kashmiris snarkily comment to Muslims – who ignored these very same issues of the degradation of democracy, the gutting of institutions, of impunity and murder – that they have got what they deserved. And frankly, it is true. Too busy fighting little turf wars to protect their “privilege” to serve the rulers, or in highlighting their difference from mainstream debates, Muslims have found themselves completely on the sidelines of democratic debate. In many ways, the failure of the elite is far greater than that of the mullahs. Most of the community members who attend madarsas, or are trained as ulema, come from under-privileged families who have few options, and have not had the depth and breadth of education or experience to engage well with politics. The elite do not have this excuse. If there is hope for Muslim leadership, it lies in the fact that the prosperity of the nation as a whole has allowed a wider educated middle class to emerge. While the Sachar Commission report highlighted the woeful socio-economic condition of Muslims, what should not be forgotten is that Indians as a whole are far better educated and living in better conditions than at the time of Independence. As part of that progress, Muslims have benefited too, if not as much as others. This rising base of capable young men and women are the ones in the frontlines of the battle for Constitutional values, it is on their shoulders that the future of Muslim politics in India rests, and the future of India as a whole, because there is no good future with such a large part of the body politic going unrepresented.",2018-02-11,"Hindutva,BJP,Communal politics,Muslims in India","The failure, and hope, of Muslim politics in India",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/muslims-in-india-communal-politics-bjp-hindutva-kasganj-asaduddin-owaisi/story/1/22300.html
525,Angshukanta Chakraborty,"Our history and mythology are full of women punished for laughing. Laughing in an open court at the king’s follies, when everyone would rather please the emperor, is blasphemy, a written and/or unwritten code. Laughing at untruths peddled as fierce rhetoric, combatting willful instrumentalisation of historical ignorance to farcical and fearful ends is a heroine’s job. Standing out is a heroine’s way of being, laughing at the powerful whom no one dare displease is what she does for a living. , Congress MP, 63, laughed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday (February 7), when he was delivering a speech in Rajya Sabha. He was going on and on about how Gandhi wanted a “Congress-mukt Bharat”, just like hours back in Lok Sabha he had claimed without Sardar Patel, Kashmir wouldn’t have been divided. These historical distortions, fraudulent claims, these lies, that PM Modi utters in Parliament, the highest legislating body in the country, in the garb of “roaring”, or “declaring war on the Nehru-Gandhis”, as much of the media would have us believe, are enough to drive anyone with a secondary school sense of history into peals of hysterical laughter. On Twitter, historian Srinath Raghavan tweeted out the obvious “facts” of 1947 and the case of Kashmir, and many shared his words with a hearty laugh at the PM. Chowdhury laughed inside Parliament, in Rajya Sabha. While she was laughing, she was breaching “etiquette”, written down rules of good conduct, usually reserved to maintain order in the House, but also to preserve equality among the representatives. Yet, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu interrupted PM Modi to chastise Chowdhury, saying he needed to report such “loose talk and unruly behaviour”. Naidu didn’t interrupt Modi once, or contradict his claims of counterfeit, his downright disgusting humiliation of the most luminous star in India’s historical firmament, Jawaharlal Nehru. Naidu interrupted to reprimand Chowdhury instead, give her sermons of discipline, egging on PM Modi in his act of hysterical fraudulence.  It was then PM Modi, in a matter of pointed rebuke, said the chairman mustn’t say anything to Chowdhury, because it was after a long time since Ramanad Sagar's   serial was aired, did they get to hear such a laughter. MoS home Kiren Rijiju tweeted out the clip, describing Chowdhury’s laugh as “vexatious”. Some headlines called it  , others reported how BJP national president and Rajya Sabha MP Amit Shah burst out laughing after Modi’s rebuke, along with the men and a few women in the upper House, laughing along, because they dare not laugh at. 
 
 There are many Ramayanas, but in the version most pleasing to the north Indian patriarchy that has a fetish for the warrior king Rama, the laughing women are not the female protagonists. Surpanakha, Ravana’s sister, supposedly laughed at Lakshmana, and had her nose cut off. Manthara, the hunchback aide to Kaikeyi, the middle queen, the muddle queen, of Dasharatha, perhaps laughed while whispering the lure of power and the throne into the queen’s ears. Laughing in Ramayana is akin to evil; laughing is dangerous because it liberates women from the rib cage of patriarchy. In turn, patriarchy, its scribes, retellers, turn them into deformed minds and bodies, monstrosities stinking of deeply racial stereotypes, making them responsible for what’s ultimately a challenge to the inevitability of primogeniture - eldest male succession - and male control of everything around. In feminist rereadings of Ramayana,  , as she sings the blues, controls her womb, makes decisions. In male fantasy version of Ramayana, Sita immolates herself for the sake of her husband, to prove her chastity. However, in the superior epic that’s Mahabharata, the female protagonist Draupadi laughs a lot, menstruates, has sex with five men at least. Draupadi laughs at Duryodhana when he falls into a pool thinking it’s a crystal floor in a palace at Indraprastha. Duryodhana takes his revenge by having his younger brother try disrobe Draupadi in the court of king Dhritarashtra, before a manel of royal loyalists, some tied to the throne, some to sycophancy, turning away their gaze from the injustice. The Kuru clan gets decimated in a “just war”, desired by the Kurus themselves. Laughing women appear in Greco-Roman myths. Helen (before she was of Troy) had laughed at the uncouth Menelaus, whom she was wedded to. She eloped with Paris, and Homer made her the peg on which to hang the male imperial and sexual insecurities. In  , French feminist Helene Cixous wrote how the laughing woman is always the outlier, the biggest challenger to patriarchy’s self-replicating tropes. So, she must be turned into a demon, a gorgon. The laughing woman is seen as a castrator, an antithesis to the power of the male pen and the penis. Laughing women are punished by gods everywhere, turned into stone, raped, turned into animals, cast away, chained, imprisoned, rebuked, called a witch, bitch. Laughing women’s agency makes the gods shiver, so they take to collective punishment. Even Milan Kundera, the great Czech writer of  - weaponised the male laughter at the powerful as worthy of his writerly attention, critical engagement. Female laughter deflated even men like Kundera; so characters like Zedna laugh but also complain, nag. Female solitude was erotic - but female laughter too challenging, too uncomfortable, in fact “emasculating”. Men laughing at men, or men becoming victims of the political consequences of their unscheduled laughter, men refusing to join in the chorus of orchestrated laughter, the theatre of cheerfulness at a totalitarian time - they happen to people Kundera’s universe of laughing men in a laughable world. But women are either props of that laughable world, or outliers incinerating the self-worth of these leading men, prompting the writer to scavenge the myths in search of a bogus salvation. Renuka Chowdhury laughed at Narendra Modi, in Parliament. It’s the laughter of powerless at the powerful, the laughter that momentarily inverts the order, as it were. Chowdhury’s laughter resembled that of Baubo, the Greek goddess of mirth and laughter, whose liberation is bundled with her wisdom, for she knows she must laugh at the powerful, and heal the powerless. And that solitary laughter at power is incredibly more powerful than a court laughing at its single female challenger, the harbinger of the imminent fall.      ",2018-02-08,"Patriarchy,Parliament,Modi,Renuka Chowdhury",Why Renuka Chowdhury’s laughter is more powerful than that of Modi coterie,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/renuka-chowdhury-laughter-modi-parliament-patriarchy-bjp-ramayana-mahabharata-draupadi/story/1/22262.html
526,Geeta Mohan,"The  administration, in what is being termed as ""bold"" and a ""historic"" visit, has decided to de-hyphenate   and engage with both nations separately. While many believed that the Indian prime minister and his government will shift course, after the BJP came to power in 2014, from the traditional line that India always took on Palestine, the decision to vote in favour of Palestine at the UN and now the visit has infused hope and confidence in Ramallah. Not only has a strong foreign policy decision been made, but also the highest level of the Indian leadership has “belled the cat”, taking on the daunting task of visiting Ramallah. 
 
 For many years, India’s visit to Israel and Palestine at the highest level were given a miss keeping in mind the ""sensitivities"" involved. And then in 2017, breaking away from past trappings, Prime Minister Modi took the bold decision to visit Israel - visit Israel alone without touching Palestine, which made many question India’s stand. Have we given up on Palestine? Is this a shift in India’s foreign policy? These were the common refrain. Clearly not. Certain sections in India hailed the Israel visit as one where India has charted out a new course for itself without pandering to the “appeasement” brigade and reaching out to Muslims... Until reality set in. India understood the importance of balancing ties and accounting for the important role Arab nations play in India’s economic growth story which led to the announcement of his “stand-alone” visit to Palestine. But many still ask, will Modi stay the course on India’s support to the Palestinian cause? India’s defence and security ties with Israel is growing exponentially. And the strong Jewish lobby certainly can help India’s case against Pakistan in the United States. But then again, Israel also has great relations with China. A nation that sides with Pakistan even if all odds are against the latter. Either Israel can be an influencer or despite strong Sino-Israel ties, China can continue to support Pakistan. The Arab world, on the other hand, is a stabilising factor providing jobs and is a major source of energy for India. But here again, terrorism and security matters sometimes adversely impact India’s interests. If India is trying to be transactional in its dealings with the nations of this region, then the decision to stay the course works in India’s favour. There is a strong opinion growing in Palestine that with the disruptive role that the US has played on the issue of Jerusalem and with the closeness that Modi shares with Benjamin Netanyahu, India could be an influencer rather than a disruptor. But both Israel and Palestine also realise that the Modi era is finite. Hence, what is important is to ensure a continuum in the foreign policy rather than a hasty shift that could spoil India’s equilibrium in the region. Interestingly, both Israel and Palestine are calling the outreach a “love affair”, neither unable to fathom why is Modi giving the time of day to the other.",2018-02-09,"Gulf,Narendra Modi,Israel,India-Palestine ties","National interest over ideology, but will India stay the course on Palestine?",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-palestine-visit-gulf-israel-mahmoud-abbas-ramallah-benjamin-netanyahu/story/1/22269.html
527,Nikhil Wagle,"There is a new spring in Sharad Pawar’s step ahead of the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in 2019. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief has already managed to cobble up an informal alliance, and we saw a glimpse of that at the January 26 "" "" march in Mumbai. Even though the rally was organised by MP Raju Shetty and MLC Jitendra Awhad, Pawar was the one pulling the strings. He personally made calls to the main Opposition leaders, ensuring the presence of the likes of Sharad Yadav, Sitaram Yechury, Omar Abdullah, D Raja and so on. More importantly, the senior state Congress leaders too were present at the rally. If there is any chance of an Opposition unity, Pawar knows it isn’t possible without the backing of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. He was in touch with them from the beginning. On top of that, he even tweeted saying that the next moves would be decided after consulting Rahul Gandhi. Later, the Opposition leaders held two more meetings, one at Sonia Gandhi’s residence, and the other at Pawar’s. 
 
 Known for his astuteness, Pawar’s strategy should be seen in the context of the dramatically changing political climate in India. According to an IndiaSpend analysis published recently, the BJP could be down to   from its unprecedented 282 seats. In the last four years, 15 states have witnessed Assembly elections. Those 15 states had fetched the BJP 191 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. But considering the downward popularity of the BJP in those states, along with trends in Gujarat Assembly elections and Rajasthan by-polls, the ruling party looks set to lose considerable vote share in 2019. In such a scenario, the non-BJP and non-Congress parties can make a considerable difference. If the BJP is restricted at around 225, and the Congress at 125, the remaining 193 seats could be crucial, and that is where Pawar comes into play. He enjoys excellent rapport with parties across the board, irrespective of their ideologies. And with BJP’s current allies such as the Shiv Sena, the TDP and the Akali Dal upset with Modi, Pawar could easily exploit the situation. Moreover, more than 100 BJP’s MPs are Congress turncoats. Smelling an opportunity, Pawar seems to have rekindled his dream of becoming the prime minister. He has been trying his luck since Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, however, only in vain. In 1991, Pawar took on PV Narasimha Rao in the leadership race. I was witness to these happenings in New Delhi. Pawar’s Man Friday, Suresh Kalmadi, tried his best even as  his industrialist friends extended their full support. But Narasimha Rao was equally shrewd and knew the Congress party better than Pawar. He defeated Pawar, made him defence minister and sent him back to Maharashtra after the 1993 blasts. Since then Pawar’s close associates have tried their best to revive his dream during each Parliament election except the 2014 battle. The Modi wave had seemingly demolished Pawar’s dream even before the race began. Pawar admitted this publicly several times. But now in a changed political scenario, the NCP veteran has become active once again. Of course, if you ask him that, he would deny it immediately. However, there are several impediments in the way of his PM dream. The biggest of them is his own credibility crisis, not just in Maharashtra, but across the country. Even Opposition leaders around him concede the fact that he cannot be trusted. Not too long ago, his party unconditionally supported the   government in Maharashtra from outside in 2014 and kept the minority BJP government afloat after the Assembly polls threw up a hung verdict. Also, his friendship with Modi is looked at with suspicion. And even though his relationship with Rahul Gandhi has improved in the recent past, to what extent will the Congress president repose his trust in Pawar is anybody’s guess. Further, how would the big Opposition leaders with even bigger egos work with each other? The TMC is currently the third-largest party in Lok Sabha. Mamata Banerjee’s hold over West Bengal is comfortable. Even though she sent her representative to Mumbai for the rally, she later said it is just a formality. Why would Banerjee accept Pawar’s leadership, who doesn’t even have 15 MPs? Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav will also ask the same question. Within a week of the Pawar-led march, Akhilesh Yadav conducted his own rally in Mumbai. Moreover, Akhilesh and Mayawati haven’t joined hands either. Even in Mumbai, Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh chief and Dalit stalwart Prakash Ambedkar is not ready to repose his trust in Pawar. On top of that, leaders from the southern states remain unpredictable as ever. The ego battles between regional parties are historic and the country has seen it closely in 1977, 1989 and 1996. There is another possibility that cannot be neglected. If the BJP’s seats go down to a level where Modi cannot hold the allies together,   within the NDA could emerge as a preferred candidate to lead the country. The late PA Sangma’s son and NPP chief Conrad Sangma, has recently said that in as many words. (For the uninitiated, the National People's Party was formed by the veteran PA Sangma after he left the NCP, which he, along with Sharad Pawar and Tariq Anwar, founded in 1999 following their expulsion from the Congress for opposing Sonia Gandhi's leadership over her foreign origin. Pawar and Sangma later fell out after the NCP refused to back Sangma's candidature for President of India in 2012. An ally of the NDA, the NPP's influence is mostly concentrated in Meghalaya, which is going to Assembly polls on February 27.) Notwithstanding the ever-changing equations, Pawar in all likelihood will continue to play an important role.

528,Amitabh Srivastava,"A probe that began after the arrest of Abdul Nayeem Sheikh, a major Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror operative, from Charbagh bus stand in Lucknow on November 28, has raised a red flag about terrorists using Bihar, both as a hideout and a recruiting centre. Sheikh is the man behind the 2006 Aurangabad arms haul case in which a huge cache of arms and explosives to target political leaders were procured. Leads from Sheikh’s sustained interrogation have already helped the National Investigation Agency (NIA) make two vital arrests from Bihar’s Gopalganj district. The latest arrests were on Thursday when the premier investigating agency picked a suspected operative of terrorist outfit LeT from Gopalganj district for his alleged involvement in creating a sleeper cell of the banned organisation in Bihar. An NIA team from Delhi picked up one Mahfooz Alam from his house at Khajurbanni locality of Gopalganj, around 145km northwest of capital city Patna. Alam has been taken to Delhi for interrogation. Incidentally, this was NIA’s second arrest the same district in last two months after the agency picked one Bedar Bakht alias Dhannu Raja on December 1.  Both Alam and Bakht have been found to have assisted Sheikh, and provided logistic, financial support and shelter to him. The two also collected funds for Sheikh through international money transfer services. All these arrests have revealed an uncanny terror link to Gopalganj district, as Sheikh too had spent two years in this district from early 2015 to March 2017. These arrests have raised a flag about Bihar, as the intelligence agencies are said to be assessing what drew the terrorists to Gopalganj district. While he was in Gopalganj, Sheikh ran a private coaching institute in the Bihar town, where he indoctrinated youths and built sleeper cells of the banned terror outfit. Prior to making Bihar his base, Sheikh was arrested in West Bengal in 2007 while infiltrating into India from Bangladesh with two Pakistanis and one Kashmiri. He escaped from judicial custody in 2014 while being taken to Mumbai to the MCOCA court there. Investigations have revealed that while government agencies frantically searched for him after his escape, Sheikh was relatively safe, teaching spoken English at his Gopalganj-based coaching institute called Smart Learner. Sheikh, considered close to 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Abu Jindal, had obtained Aadhaar card, passport and PAN (Permanent Account Number) under a pseudonym of Suhail Khan alias Mohammad Ali. Incidentally, Nayeem’s story bears an uncanny resemblance to that of Md Tauseef Khan, the 30- something mastermind of the July 2008 Ahmedabad blast, who was arrested from Bihar’s Gaya district in September last year. Tauseef too had taken shelter in Bihar’s Gaya district and was working as a school-teacher after triggering explosions in Ahmedabad, which killed 56 people and injured over 200. Nayeem is also believed to have obtained fake certificates of secondary school to get his passport issued from the Patna regional passport office. The NIA is also questioning a number of district-level officials to find out how Abdul Nayeem Sheikh, a Lashkar-e-Toiba operative, succeeded in getting a domicile certificate, driving license, matriculation certificate and passport issued in the assumed name of Suhail Khan. Incidentally, Bihar has its old connections with terror outfits. Indian Mujahideen co-founder Yasin Bhatkal and another operative, Abdul Karim Tunda, were arrested from the Raxaul border in East Champaran district.

529,Minhaz Merchant,"To win re-election in the next Lok Sabha elections,   to form a government without depending on an increasingly volatile set of NDA allies. Let’s do the electoral math by placing the country into four clusters: 1) north and west; 2) south; 3) east; and 4) Northeast and union territories.  This comprises 12 states (Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh). Together they offer 259 seats. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 205 seats out of its overall tally of 282 seats from this 12-state, 259-seat cluster. This is therefore the make-or-break cluster for the BJP. In 2019 though, it can realistically expect to win only around 150 seats from these 12 key north-western states. That’s a fall of 55 seats over 2014 due to strong anti-incumbency, the Congress’ resurgence and the   across the region. Can it make up this large decline in the other zones?  The five are unlikely to provide a cushion. The BJP won 21 out of 129 available seats in the south in 2014. Karnataka provided 17 of these. Again realistically, the BJP is unlikely to increase its tally significantly in 2019. Kerala may offer the odd extra seat. Karnataka could even slip a little, leaving the BJP with around 20 seats in the south. Together in the first two clusters, the BJP’s tally could therefore total around 170.  The four key eastern states of Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand could prove crucial for the BJP. In 2014, the BJP won 37 seats in these four states from 117 seats on offer. In 2019, it will rely heavily on seat-sharing with ally JD(U) to sweep Bihar. Odisha promises a rich harvest too with dissent at the top of Naveen Patnaik’s BJD giving the BJP an opening. West Bengal remains a distant prospect though the BJP is likely to make inroads as the Left continues to lose traction. Meanwhile, with Jharkhand, where the BJP won 12 out of 14 seats in 2014, still a safe bet, the BJP could increase its tally in the 117-seat east cluster from 37 seats in 2014 to around 45 seats in 2019. Thus, the BJP’s overall tally in the first three clusters rises to around 215 seats.  The   has been a special focus for the BJP. In 2014, it won just eight out of 25 seats in the seven northeastern states and Sikkim - seven of them from Assam. The BJP-backed North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) has changed the situation dramatically. The party can expect to raise its tally to around 14 seats in 2019. The seven union territories (UTs), including Delhi NCT, contributed 11 out of 13 available seats to the BJP in 2014. That total is unlikely to change much, though Delhi could swing partially towards the Congress, giving the BJP around 25 out of 38 seats on offer in the fourth cluster. Thus, the four clusters, in a best-case scenario, are likely to provide the BJP with 240 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election (150+20+45+25). Caveat: a Mayawati-Mulayam-Congress mahagathbandhan, however unlikely, could significantly reduce the BJP’s tally in Uttar Pradesh, cutting its Lok Sabha numbers to the low 220s. Unpredictable events such as a positive verdict by the Supreme Court in the Ram Mandir case and escalation of a conflict with Pakistan could in turn change the electoral math in favour of the BJP. Clearly, the BJP with 220-240 seats will not be able to form a government without the support of NDA allies. The Shiv Sena, TDP, LJP, SAD and others have varying degrees of problems with the BJP. To form a stable NDA coalition, the BJP would need at least 50 seats from its allies, taking the alliance’s tally to around 270-290. With the JD(U), but without the Shiv Sena, even that may prove difficult. The Rajinikanth factor in Tamil Nadu though could play a decisive role if he allies with the NDA, making Shiv Sena support redundant. Now turn to the Congress. To win power, Rahul Gandhi will have to rely heavily on old and new UPA allies. Across our four clusters, the Congress will be lucky to win 85-90 seats overall. To be a credible challenger to form a UPA 3 government, the Congress will need the following eleven key allies: TMC, the Left, DMK, SP, RJD, BSP, JD(S), AIMIM, NC, NCP and TRS. Defections from the NDA’s disgruntled allies would be welcome. Again, taking a best-case scenario, despite the unlikely prospect of the BSP and SP as well as the Left and TMC cohabiting in UPA 3, the 11 key allies together with smaller Congress-leaning parties are unlikely to garner more than 120 seats. Even if the Congress doubles its own tally to 90 seats, a putative UPA 3 would have only 210 Lok Sabha seats in all (90+120) - far short of a working majority. The way forward for the Congress therefore is to win at least 150 seats on its own as it did in 2004. Then only will it be able to cobble together a workable UPA 3 coalition in 2019 with over 270 seats (150 Congress plus 120 allies). In 2004, the Left with 60 seats supported the 145-seat Congress from outside. Other UPA 1 allies made up the numbers. In 2019, though relatively weakened, the BJP will still win far more than the 138 seats it won in 2004. At our estimate of 220-240 seats, the BJP can effectively thwart a potential UPA 3 - unless the Congress nearly quadruples its 2014 tally of 44 to well over 150. There just aren’t enough UPA allies to make up the slack as there were in 2004 with the Left’s 60 seats plumetting in 2014 to just nine. In 2019, the largest UPA ally will be the TMC with 30-odd seats. For the BJP, the message is clear. Five consecutive mediocre Budgets have alienated the middle class. They count for little electorally, but have a disproportionate influence on the political narrative. The BJP’s policies over the past 45 months have been a mixed bag: in sum, it has failed to deliver maximum governance and minimum government. It has less than a year to reverse the slide. The Lok Sabha election may well be advanced to December 2018 along with the key state polls of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in order to mask strong anti-incumbency. The BJP though does have one trump card: a still-anaemic Congress. But it can’t rely on that forever. To win re-election, the BJP will have to perform.

530,Harsh V Pant,"Crisis in the Maldives escalated this week after President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of Emergency and asked the military troops to arrest two top judges and detain former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has allied himself with the Opposition. Last week the nation’s Supreme Court had ordered the release of nine imprisoned Opposition politicians on the ground that their trials were politically motivated and flawed. The government refused to implement the ruling which led to widespread demonstrations in Male and clashes between the police and protesters. Calling President Yameen’s announcement “unconstitutional and illegal”, exiled former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed, the country’s first democratically-elected leader, has urged India to “act swiftly” to resolve the crisis. In some ways, Yameen’s actions are understandable as his options after the Supreme Court ruling were limited. The court verdict not only paves the way for Nasheed to return from his exile in Colombo and run for the presidency this year but also makes Yameen’s impeachment potentially plausible. Yameen must be calculating that with help of friends of like China, he would be able to ride over the crisis that would emerge with his declaration of Emergency. The alacrity with which the Maldives embraced China seems to have caught India off guard. But New Delhi’s engagement with Male has been hesitant of late and China has made the most of it. During Yameen’s China visit last year, the two nations signed 12 pacts, including a free trade agreement. Yameen also fully endorsed China’s ambitious Maritime Silk Road initiative. President Xi Jinping declared that “China deems the Maldives as an important partner” in this initiative and Yameen repaid the favour by claiming that the Maldives viewed China “among (its) closest friends” and that “the Belt and Road Initiative has greatly helped the development of many small and medium countries”. At a time when China’s belt and road initiative is beginning to attract scrutiny around the world, with even erstwhile supporters calling for a reassessment, such an endorsement is much sought after by Beijing. The Maldives became the second country in South Asia, after Pakistan, to enter into a free trade agreement with China. The Yameen government pushed the FTA through the nation’s Parliament, the Majlis, stealthily, with the Opposition not attending the parliamentary session. The principal Opposition party, the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), said that it was “deeply concerned over sudden and rushed Free Trade Agreement with China, without any disclosure of details to the public or to the MPs”. The concerns of the Opposition centre around a possible increase in the trade deficit, already tilted in favour of China, and the strategic direction of the country. The MDP has argued that it is worried “that further entrenchment of the country into a Chinese debt trap will result in additional stress on strategic national assets and increasing instability in the Indian Ocean region”. But that is where Yameen wants to take his country, it seems. On the one hand, he has been flirting with Islamist extremism and on the other, he wants to use closer ties with China to shield his government from global criticism. After the first-ever visit by a Chinese President to the Maldives in 2014, it officially became a part of the ""21st-century Maritime Silk Road."" China quickly expanded its economic profile in the Maldives by building mega infrastructure projects, including the development of Hulhule island and a bridge connecting it to Male as well as the country’s main international airport. A constitutional amendment allowing foreign ownership of freehold land was passed in 2015, which can potentially enhance Chinese military presence in the island nation. Already, Chinese naval ships have become regular visitors to Male. During his 2016 visit to Delhi, Yameen had said his country pursues an “India first” foreign policy, describing it as the Maldives’s most important friend. But that was just after India had shielded the Yameen government from punitive action by the Commonwealth’s human rights and democracy oversight body. New Delhi’s recent policy of engaging with the Maldivian Opposition, especially the former President, Mohammad Nasheed, may be causing heartburn in Male and so the outreach to China has intensified. The Maldives remains the only country in South Asia which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is yet to visit. There were many in India who had been critical of the Modi government’s light touch approach vis-à-vis Yameen over the last few years as he systematically worked at destroying the foundations of democracy in his country. But New Delhi had other interests to preserve in the archipelago nation. Now the moment of reckoning has come for both New Delhi and Yameen. India’s suggestion that the Supreme Court’s ruling should be promptly implemented was clearly given a short shrift by Yameen. New Delhi will have to intervene cautiously. A coordinated response with other like-minded regional and extra-regional players will be the first step. But like in the past, New Delhi should not be shy of using coercive diplomacy if only to underscore that ignoring India’s warnings comes at a price. The logic of geography dictates that India’s role will be critical in determining the trajectory of political developments in the Maldives.

531,Sanjay Jha,"It is not just individuals who get afflicted with the medical condition of schizophrenia. So do nations. Nothing manifested that better than the congregation of the super rich, their global affluence evident as their private jets swooped into the Swiss Alps at Davos, an annual bash of eclectic celebrity capitalists where India was supposedly doing a showstopper-walk, and the tragic suicide of  , an 84-year-old beleaguered farmer from Maharashtra who committed suicide amid the hustle-bustle of Mumbai's non-stop irrepressible energy. There could not have been a more apposite paradox to explain India's inherent contradictions. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi made another of his highfalutin speeches to hard-sell India (even as India Inc palpably serenaded him on bent knees, despite the snow), but appeared blissfully unaware of some hard economic data that had surfaced concomitantly from the organisers, the World Economic Forum itself. India's ranking in the Inclusive Development Index had slumped to 62; an appalling commentary on the skewed policies of the last four years of Mr Modi's government which has increased social disparities. Not surprisingly, it seemed to synchronise with the astonishing fact that  . US President Donald Trump followed Modi to justify his America First pitch to the august gathering of essentially free-market fundamentalists. Like India, America has seen an escalating income inequality, ironically electing a tax-evading, anti-free trade, ultra-nationalist avatar in a billionaire businessman with a dubious track-record as its man in the White House. Politics is indeed weird. Even as India's stock markets breached stratospheric levels crossing 35,000 levels prompting pink papers to go into uncontrollable euphoria, Dharma Patil lay dead at JJ hospital. The state government of Maharashtra had refused to respond to his several entreaties for help after it acquired his land for a pathetic pittance. It was unconscionable. The opposition blamed the government of Devendra Fadnavis for culpable homicide; in effect, it was callous nonchalance to a desperate cry for help. It was a stark reminder of one Gajendra Singh from Rajasthan who hung himself from a tree while an election rally proceeded with much fanfare in New Delhi. It was an ugly manifestation of a society that had forgotten its once revered creator of the rice bowl. Evidently, we have chosen to turn a blind eye to the hapless farmer, once deserving of a national call; Jai Jawan Jai Kisan. Arun Jaitley, India's Finance Minister, who famously declared that India will double farmers' income in five years, has been extraordinarily silent on his progress report. Perhaps that is understandable given that after four years of the Modi government , the average agricultural growth is just 1.9 per cent. To achieve the ambitious growth levels projected with profuse showmanship by the government, a minimum of 12 per cent is needed. The target is ridiculously off the curve, but ask any policy wonk and he will tell you that it is always a preposterous kite-flying exercise. That begs the question, have we become so politically immoral that we make even suffering farmers dream of bountiful profits when in fact it is nothing more than a mirage, a chimera? Or are Indian politicians, once elected, decoupled from ground realities? In his farewell budget on February 1, 2018, Mr Jaitley made another grandiloquent claim; that his government had successfully provided for minimum support price of 50 per cent over cost-of-crop production as it had promised in its 2014 manifesto. It seemed like a stunning apocryphal story, because the definition of the cost of production had been deliberately left ambiguous. The convenient formula was adopted, but based on that measure, the farmers were getting 50 per cent over MSP since the UPA days. In that case, what was Modi promising during the 2014 election campaign? At the time of writing, very few in the mainstream media have even questioned this brazen inconsistency. Mr Modi also magnanimously laid out the red carpet for foreign investors citing India's charming hospitality and tranquil environs. But back home it was anything but. The release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's   was meshed in  , and agitating Karni Sena supporters had become official non-state actors, as several BJP state governments happily catapulted to their intimidating threat to not release the controversial film. Chopping off heads of those who were related to the film was publicly broadcasted by these insidious hate groups, but the prime minister did not think a strong condemnation was necessary. Despite a scathing indictment from the Supreme Court, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh refused to screen the film, citing law and order risks. It was tantamount to acquiescing that they were incapable of ensuring governance, despite having the full police force under their authority. The world could see the farcical melodrama turning violent, but India's elected leaders did not budge. What was once classified as right wing fringe was now a legitimate mainstream disruptor, courtesy official umbrage. Their poisonous footprint is on the rise, as punitive action has not been taken. At last count the film was headed for blockbuster box-office collections, and the Rajput community had not found anything offensive enough about it. So what was the purpose behind the belligerent posturing? And why did Indian politicians play ball? But on the day of the hugely hyped budget, something remarkable happened. Even as Mr Jaitley gave his budget speech, from nearby Rajasthan, people spoke in collective unison, condemning both the wilful neglect of the farming community and the senseless mayhem over a commercial film. The BJP got a   in two Lok Sabha and one assembly seat. The voters had seen through their forked tongue that sells stardust dreams even as it deliberately ignores solving the real issues.

532,TS Sudhir,"Tamil has been on MK Stalin's mind this week. At a marriage function in Chennai, Stalin asked parents to name their children with “beautiful Tamil names”. He cited the example of his own family, where everyone except him, was given a Tamil name.  “My father wanted to name me Ayyadurai, because social reformer Periyar was referred to as Ayya and Durai was the name of DMK founder CN Annadurai. But the day I was born, my father was attending a condolence meeting of Russian leader Joseph Stalin. When he was informed of my birth while on stage, he instantly announced he was naming me after Stalin,” revealed the DMK working president.   Stalin wasn't merely regaling the audience with a story. The attempt is to subtly contrast it with Delhi's lack of enthusiasm for Tamil. This comes at a time, when the Centre, in a reply to a question in Parliament, reiterated the position of the Supreme Court that had ruled in 2012 that Tamil cannot be the official language of the Madras High Court. It may be noted that in 2006, when Karunanidhi was the CM, the Tamil Nadu Assembly assed a resolution, urging the Centre to get Presidential assent to make Tamil the official language in the high court.  In the last 24 hours, members of the judiciary, too, have pitched in, arguing that making Tamil the language of the courtrooms would make it easy for litigants, especially those from rural areas.  On the face of it, one can look at the question asked in the Rajya Sabha as one pertaining only to the judiciary. But that would be missing the point. The political context is the renewed attempt by the DMK to invoke pride in Tamil language. Stalin has, on more than one occasion in the past four years, spoken against moves to promote Hindi at the cost of Tamil in Tamil Nadu. Strangely, the DMK glosses over its failure to get the then UPA government, in which it was a partner, to get its way in 2006. Matters have only got more difficult now with the Centre citing the SC order and the NDA government's own emphasis on Hindi.  The language card has become a rallying point for a Dravidian party, like the DMK, against the BJP, which is seen as a Hindi and Hindutva party in the state. The BJP, too, has given enough opportunities. The provocation came soon after the party came to power in May, 2014. According to a report of  ,  that year asking government employees and officials of all ministries, departments, corporations and banks to use “Hindi or both Hindi and English” on their social media accounts, but “give priority to Hindi”. Recently, when milestones on the National Highways in different parts of Tamil Nadu, like Krishnagiri and Vellore, were painted with names in Hindi, Stalin accused the BJP government of Hindi hegemony. It took an uproar with threats of reviving the anti-Hindi agitation of the 1960s to force the authorities to pull back.  Even on the day the Budget was presented in Parliament, social media users from Tamil Nadu criticised finance minister Arun Jaitley for frequently switching into Hindi during his speech.  What is the game plan behind the renewed focus on Tamil? With elections in 2019 and the possibility of Assembly polls taking place anytime, if the fragile AIADMK government collapses, the DMK seems to have zeroed in on the Tamil template. The intention, it would seem, is to combat the nationalistic slogan of the BJP with its own brand of Tamil sub-nationalism. In a sense, it is similar to how Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah is harping on Kannadiga pride, with emphasis on Kannada language and Karnataka flag, to offset the brand of nationalism the BJP espouses.  But while it may galvanise a few, Stalin would be committing a mistake if he makes it the cornerstone of his campaign. 2018 is not 1965 and a large section of Tamil Nadu sees merit in learning Hindi as a means of communication. After the anti-Hindi agitation, India has followed a three-language formula with English, Hindi and the regional language at the school level. It seems that just like the DMK under Annadurai rode on the anti-Hindi agitation to come to power, Stalin is borrowing the template in a post-Jayalalithaa era. But if the DMK tries to make Tamil Nadu into a parochial island, harping solely on the Tamil identity, it faces the risk of boomeranging.  What Stalin and team seem to be doing is to mark out a new rival as it fears the rise of BJP in Tamil Nadu, where the AIADMK has been systematically weakened over the last year. And Stalin, it would seem, wants to fight that battle in chaste Tamil.  This anecdote, however, gives an interesting spin to DMK's anti-Hindi position. The story goes that Karunanidhi was asked why he nominated a young Dayanidhi Maran to the UPA Cabinet in 2004 when there were senior DMK MPs available. Karunanidhi is believed to have said Dayanidhi knew Hindi. ",2018-02-04,"Tamil Nadu,Hindi,MK Stalin,Tamil",Hindi is becoming a rallying point in Tamil Nadu politics again,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tamil-mk-stalin-hindi-tamil-nadu-karunanidhi-madras-high-court-anti-hindi-agitation/story/1/22178.html
533,M Reyaz,"One of the top trends on Twitter on Saturday was #AnkitSaxena, a 23-year old young photographer from Delhi   by the family members of the 20-year old girl he was allegedly in a relationship with for three years. No, Ankit's case was not trending merely to demand justice for the victim's family or as a debate over the law and order situation in the national capital. Not even because some custodians of culture and tradition are supporting the murderers or because Twitterati are outraged over the ""honour killing"". Ankit's case has instead given the right wing and their whole politics grounds to demonise and target the community they love to hate. Ankit's girlfriend Shehzadi was a Muslim. His killers, the girl's father, mother, uncle and a minor brother also come from the same faith. She had allegedly locked her family members in the house and fled after an argument. The enraged father, accompanied by other family members, came out with a knife in his hand and found Ankit, who lived nearby in west Delhi, on a scooter. A scuffle started. According to the police, as the family members held Ankit tightly, the father of the girl slit his throat. All accused have already been arrested, and a case has been filed at the local police station in west Delhi. One hopes that the law will take its course and the aggrieved family will get justice. What is troubling is that instead of asking for justice certain media and the right wing forces are using the case to bash the entire Muslim community and they are being forced to condemn the gruesome incident. So far only in terror cases guilt by association was raised to target one community, but even though not one person has spoken in support of the murderers, the whole community is being demonised and bashed. Imagine for a moment that the boy was Muslim and girl a Hindu, the right wing would have justified the incident in the name of a purported case of ""love jihad"". On the contrary, I have not come across any Muslim on social media justifying the murder; rather they have all expressed shock, some have condemned it and demanded swift action from the police. It is rather ironical that the same people who are targeting the Muslim community would be asking people to celebrate on February 14, the Valentine's Day, as ""Matri Pitri Poojan Diwas"", and have called Hadiya a victim of love jihad. Religion must have played an important role in the decision of Shehzadi's family to not accept their daughter's choice, but it is more of a patriarchal problem than anything else. I have written earlier, how families find any pretext under the sky to  . Our society at large has still not come to terms with the fact that adult men and women can themselves make a better decision in choosing their life partner, and would rather get them married to people of their choice. The so-called   is one of most dishonourable things for any society that claims to be civilised, irrespective of religion or creed or caste. Professor Dibyesh Anand of Westminster University rightly pointed out after the incident, ""The lethal concept is not a religion but proprietorial-patriarchal-family-honour that afflicts many Hindus, Muslims, and others alike."" Killing a daughter or her partner for defying them is not unique to any one community but is a larger malaise in our part of the world that sadly often has sanctions from religious leaders as well as community formations such as khap panchayats. Only in January, there was a report of a (Hindu)   as he had dared to marry the girl from another caste. And ironically on the same day Ankit was murdered, I saw a  , of a woman being savagely flogged for an alleged extramarital affair. There is a lesson we can all learn from Ankit's father, Yashpal Saxena. He , who reportedly visited the family, ""I do not have hatred against any community.

534,Kiran Tare,"The BJP has found itself at the receiving end since a 84-year-old farmer from Dhule, Dharma Patil, died in Mumbai on January 29, less than a week after consuming poison. The Opposition has claimed that Patil consumed the poison outside chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s office at the sixth floor of Mantralaya as the government failed to deliver justice to him. Patil had received compensation of Rs 4 lakh for his five-acre farm whereas his neighbour Kisan Girase got Rs 1.98 crore for one-acre farmland, though both of them had planted mango trees. The case has exposed the chinks in the state’s administration as well as the unholy practices adopted while granting compensation to land. Girase stands accused of paying a bribe of Rs 1 crore to the officials from land acquisition department to get higher compensation. At the same time, a nexus between officials and land-selling agents also has come to fore. Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar admits that the nexus exists. “The government does not make any discrimination between the beneficiaries. It is the officials who misinterpret and take disadvantage of the government schemes,” he told me. It has become a trend over a couple of years to plant mango trees in farm land to increase its value at the time of land acquisition even though the climate does not suit the trees. Water resources minister Girish Mahajan points that agents purchase land from poor farmers at throwaway prices, “import” mango trees from Konkan and demand higher price at the time of acquisition. The mango trees are literally “replanted” to create an impression that they exist in a particular farm land for many years. As per rules, if a farm land has mango trees its values grows multifold. In some cases, the government has given Rs 1 crore for one acre farm land when the actual price was Rs 10 lakh because of the mango trees. “This is not possible without the direct involvement of government officials,” Mahajan admitted. “They know it better which land would be acquired for which project.” He pointed that the government had carried survey of the proposed super communication highway between Nagpur and Mumbai, known as Samruddhi Corridor, using Google maps to count the number of trees on the patch before the project was announced. “If we had not done that the agents would have replanted mango trees everywhere on the corridor making the project economically unviable,” Mahajan said. The government has reserved Rs 10,000 crore only for compensation to land acquisition. The nexus exists for a long time. Patil’s case has given the government an opportunity to break it once and all.  (Courtesy of  )",2018-02-02,"BJP,Dharma Patil,Devendra Fadnavis,Mango Scam",It's rotten.

A grand scheme intended to tackle an incredibly serious policy issue with almost no details of know-how in the public domain. Yet, it was celebrated as if the outcome it sought had already been achieved. Yesterday (February 1) seemed no different. Once again we forgot what   was good at: fooling us with lofty goals with a tinge of morality added to it. “Modicare”, as it’s now being touted, seeks to provide health insurance to about 100 million “vulnerable” families across India. About 40 per cent of the country’s population (or 500 million beneficiaries) will be ""protected"" under the scheme. Yet somehow its being touted as a system of universal healthcare. A universal scheme should generally cover all citizens, but that’s a matter of separate debate. Unsurprisingly, it overshadowed pretty much everything else in the discussions around the Budget (including a higher fiscal deficit, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax and changes to custom duties for about 50 items). It was supposedly the ""aha moment"" of the  for many TV news anchors and commentators. The general consensus was that the poor and the destitute end up spending a large portion of their income on secondary and tertiary healthcare and that the government is right in providing a helping hand. Imagine if they don’t need to save for a rainy day? Imagine if they are free to use that money to consume goods and services? Imagine what would it do to accelerate growth, and thereby generate greater revenue? Undoubtedly, all of these instances are possible, but it requires a rock-solid combination of detailed plans, smooth execution, a big pot of cash and a ton of luck. Unfortunately, the way our governments are designed, its hard if not impossible to hit such a sweet spot. In this case as well, no basic plan has been charted out yet. The current plan is to draft a plan in the next six months. In terms of execution, it’s best not to glorify government’s notoriously poor record in implementation of schemes. As for cash, the government could easily end up spending thousands of crores of rupees (maybe a lot more depending on premiums). Where will the money come for it is anyone’s guess. But what seems eerily similar to demonetisation is that no cost-benefit analysis of the scheme seems to have been done. And just like demonetisation, this will most certainly become BJP’s major talking point during elections. Leaving aside these minor technicalities, one has to seriously ask if 500 million individuals in India need mandatory insurance from the government? Sure, no one is arguing against not providing subsidy to those below poverty line (and maybe others). But what about those who can? Wouldn’t they be better off left alone in deciding their choice of insurance and allow the government to use the valuable tax revenue for an alternative purpose? Choice matters as that will allow greater competition amongst private/public insurance companies and not just benefit those who are contracted with the government. India has only so many resources at hand and it would have been ideal to allow states to chart their own course (health is a state subject) rather than initiate a massive scheme from the top. Secondly, most debates moved around the ifs and buts on the health coverage. Not many offered a view from an ideological and principled standpoint. It’s rather easy to get bothered by questions around the government’s ability to fund or implement the project, but its far more important to ask if the government should sponsor such a scheme at all. A similar scheme was proposed in 2016 which offered a coverage of Rs 30,000 per family. That has now been raised to Rs 5 lakh per family. Those in Opposition can always offer another substantial hike until we will reach a point of no return. What are the chances that the government will do away with such a mandate even when most Indians will easily be able to afford it? Third, instead of focusing on drafting policies (reforming land, labour and capital) that would eventually pull people out of poverty and allow them to make enough money to pay for their own and family’s health/education, the government is creating another tax-payer funded entitlement. Yes, both (growth and redistribution) can go on simultaneously, but there is just not enough noise and movement on the former. What looks probable right now is that we will go through another loop of good intentions and bad outcomes. But considering how lucky PM Modi is (and was through the execution of demonetisation), it may just work in his favour, of course electorally.",2018-02-02,"Modi government,Union Budget 2018,Health insurance",Budget 2018: How achievable is Arun Jaitley's promise of health cover for 500 million poor Indians?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/health-insurance-union-budget-arun-jaitley-demonetisation-november-8-2016-modi-election-promise/story/1/22143.html
536,Aroon Purie,"Going into the last full Union Budget of his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not only bet on the farmers, but bet the farm on his rural voters. Articulating his vision for the general election of 2019 quite clearly, he has recognised the existence of rural distress, amplified by a string of farmer protests and suicides last year provoked by falling commodity prices and increasing debt. Hoping to deliver on his promise to double farmers’ incomes by 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, the Budget has shown every intention of boosting farmers’ incomes by raising the minimum support price for crops to 1.5x the cost of production, liberalising export of agri-commodities, and modernising agricultural markets. This comes in the wake of agri-GDP registering an insipid average annual growth rate of 2 per cent in the first three years of the Modi government - in the last three years of the UPA rule, it was nearly twice this figure. The second clear narrative in Modi Vision 2019 is the creation of jobs. The Budget has seen a push to small businesses, which were badly hit both by demonetisation and the initial implementation of GST. The corporate tax reduction for firms with turnovers below Rs 250 crore as well as Rs 3,794 crore in credit support to MSMEs could help. The continuing push to infrastructure, with expected investments in excess of Rs 50 lakh crore in roads, airports, railways, ports and inland waterways, is also of a piece with this strong effort - unemployment emerged as the biggest concern among respondents to the India Today Mood of the Nation Poll last week, along with rising prices. Equally clear is the government’s belated recognition of the importance of healthcare and education. As Amartya Sen says, no developed country in the world has progressed without investing in these key areas. On education, the Budget has announced Eklavya schools for tribals as well as 24 new medical colleges and 1,000 new fellowships for doctoral students. In healthcare, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley announced an ambitious National Health Protection Scheme, which will provide up to Rs 5 lakh per year to 100 million families for secondary and tertiary healthcare. Impressive as this sounds, I am not sure the mechanisms or details of funding have been worked out. The expense could be monumental. There is a disconcertingly familiar sense of too many announcements and too little implementation. Take the example of the Smart Cities Mission, announced in 2015, which aimed at building 100 Smart Cities with state-of-the-art amenities. So far, 99 cities have been selected with an outlay of Rs 2.04 lakh crore. But projects worth a mere Rs 2,350 crore have been completed. The rest remain ""in progress"". That’s a pathetic strike rate, which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the government’s ability to deliver. Given the additional spending, meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP for 2019 will require disinvestment and the highest ever gross taxes as a percentage of GDP. It is a tough ask, according to Crisil chief economist Dharmakirti Joshi, one of the eminent economists in our panel of commentators, but not entirely unachievable. The Budget has nothing for the middle class and large corporates, who in many ways are the bulwark of the economy. The big question is, whether all this will be enough - especially given that the GDP growth rate is expected to fall to 6.75 per cent for the current fiscal, compared to 7.1 the previous year. So far, the economic environment was conducive, but now oil prices have crossed $70 a barrel internationally, and retail inflation has breached the RBI’s target, hitting 5.21 per cent in December. Also, there is nothing to spur the investment rate which has fallen from a peak of nearly 34.3 per cent in 2011-12 to 26.4 per cent in 2017-18. Unless the government is able to move the needle on this, it is difficult to imagine the accelera­tion in economic growth so necessary to finance its ambitious schemes. My own nagging concern is an old one: I am not sure how much of government expenditure actually reaches the intended beneficiary. In 1985, on a visit to drought-affected Kalahandi in Odisha, the late Rajiv Gandhi said that of every rupee spent by the government, only 15 paise reached the intended recipient. Has that leaky bucket been fixed? If not, the electoral benefits this government is hoping  for after this Budget may not materialise. Elections are not won on grand announcements or manifestos, but on real development on the ground which people can feel.

537,Romita Datta,"A workaholic, well almost 24x7. And when she’s not working, meaning governing the state or minding politics, she is into creative pursuits — writing books, penning lyrics, composing songs, painting and doodling. Mamata Banerjee has been recently awarded the prestigious DLitt by Calcutta University for her versatile contribution in the field of literature and language and for her gigantic footprints in social work. There was much hue and cry, storm over tea stalls, debates dragging into court as to whether she merited the honorary degree. Ultimately she got the degree and she accepted it teary-eyed and her voice choking, partly for the love and appreciation of a section of people, who considered her eligible, and partly for the insult, humiliation and barbs she had to face in the process. Without going into the sanctity of the awardee, the literary merit of her work, which can be purely subjective (depending on who are judging it, on what basis, under what condition and who are conferring the title), one cannot deny the sheer numbers she has added to the world of printed letters. Half a dozen books a year is child’s play for her and she has been spewing such volume at every Kolkata Book Fair. And for all her detractors crying foul, the books are published by a leading publishing house of Bengal and they are always bestsellers — well at least as per the records of the publishing house. This year too, as the city warms up to another book fair, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is coming out again with not less than half a dozen new publications. She has a volume of already 70 published works and this year it will increase to 76. And think of the range, she has something for everyone: names of babies for would-be or new parents, rhyme-books for toddlers,   for children,   (voice of heart) Urdu shayaris for the youth,   — something about personality development of the young generation, and   (exhorting the young brigade to consider politics as a noble profession) to travelogues ( ) for the trotting community. Her memoirs on struggle —  , the tidbits of bitter-sweet memories of life —  , her youth, desires sacrificed at the altar of politics — Bikel Hnariye Geche (a personal note on how the sweet spring has slipped by), and   — a compilation of quotable quotes on the philosophy and ideology of her life, an allusion to Kathamrita — quotes of Ram Krishna Dev for the spiritually inclined, are her other book. Not to be missed is the historical documentation of important landmark events from the political work — Nandi Ma (the land movement in Nandigram), Singur, Kutshapokksho (Rumour Mongers), a commentary on how the Opposition and the BJP-led Centre were engaged in a slandering campaign to malign her on the eve of 2016 Assembly, Notebandi (Demonetisation) and this year its   (intolerance). Though the majority of the political memoirs are political campaign on her sweat and labour and the string of achievements she has been weaving in, Asohishnuta is an interesting record of the environment of hatred, fear and intolerance unleashed by the saffron party both in the country and her state. The diversity of subject and magnitude of work apart, one should not miss the proficiency of language, the ease with which she nimbly moves through languages, Bengali, English, Urdu and Ol Chiki, some of her books are being translated into Ol Chiki. So if these are not grounds, solid enough to confer her the D.litt, what are? As for the sceptical and high-browed critics, especially those who are deprecating, the Calcutta University as the conferring body chose to seal all probable leaks. The award has been given by virtue of her literary works and her social welfare activities, which have been acknowledged internationally and she has even got the prestigious UN Public Service award for Kanyashree — the scheme for empowering women. The DLitt debate has been dismissed by the court perhaps because it realised that wisdom lies in closing the chapter. After all, there is nothing new in conferring titles and awards to political personalities, great administrators and statesman and it has been the practice all over the world. When men of letters like Dr Mammohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and legends like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi get awarded, the country bursts into euphoria, and rightly so. But the feeling definitely cannot be the same when Akshay Kumar (University of Windsor in 2008) and Shilpa Shetty Kundra flaunt one or godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim claims a doctorate title from some little known UK university. The fact that PM Narendra Modi declined to be awarded a doctorate by BHU in 2016 at the peak of his popularity in recognition of him being a reformer and an outstanding leader in public service and governance is a rare, pragmatic thing. Had he accepted he would have invited similar muck throwing as happened in the case of Mamata.

538,Munish Pandey,"""Hindustan   Vande Mataram  (If you want to live in India, you have to chant Vande Mataram),"" screamed ABVP activists as they took out a ""Tiranga Yatra"" through the streets of Kasganj on January 26.   Kasganj is a Muslim-majority town in Uttar Pradesh whose chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, has vowed to end the long history of violence and riots in the state. At least, that was his poll promise of ""na goondaraj, na bhrashtachar (freedom from goons and corruption)"" to the state. However, this year's Republic Day clashes tell a very different story altogether. As residents of Kasganj, belonging to different communities, began preparing for the 69th Republic Day celebrations, a group of ABVP and VHP cadres set out on a bike rally. Passing through every mohalla, they finally reached Baliram Gate. This group, which had no police permission, was also carrying saffron flags - enough to instigate a communal outburst. As they approached the minority-dominated area, their slogans grew louder. Soon, what started out as a verbal spat turned into a violent clash with both sides throwing stones at the other. One man reached for his gun and fired in frenzy which hit 20-year-old Chandan Gupta, killing him two hours later. Another man, Naushad, was also hit in the leg by a bullet and is now recovering at an Aligarh hospital. This was enough to trigger the mob, which went on a rampage across the town. The district police force was in Etah for the Republic Day parade as the town erupted into flames. A mosque was set ablaze and the police, in an FIR, said stones were hurled and bullets fired on them as they tried to quell the commotion. By afternoon, Yogi's promise of ""na goondaraj"" was blown into pieces as shops and buses burning to cinders became the image of Kasganj. The police, unable to control the situation, imposed curfew to restrict mob movement. One company of Rapid Action Force (RAF) and five companies of Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (UP-PAC) along with police forces from adjoining districts were deployed in Kasganj. The district magistrate, inspector-general of police, commissioner of Aligarh and at least half a dozen other IPS officers from adjoining areas were deputed to control the surging violence. But all these measures had no bearing on the rapidly deteriorating condition of Kasganj. Around 9.30pm, Lakhimpur resident Mohammad Akram, unaware of the violence, was on his way home with his pregnant wife in a Tata Safari. As he reached Kasganj, the mob attacked his car. They broke the windows with bamboo sticks and almost gouged out his left eye. ""They saw my beard and attacked me. My wife is expecting and the delivery is scheduled for tomorrow,"" Akram said, his face covered in blood. Akram was attacked in the middle of the town, Agrasen Gate, and the police was absolutely unaware of the situation. Fortunately, the local correspondent of Aaj Tak, Devesh Pal Singh, who was present there informed a senior police officer even as he recorded a video on his mobile phone. By this time, the mob had already put kerosene on Akram and his pregnant wife in an attempt to burn them alive. The senior officer responded swiftly and sent his forces just in time to save them. Akram is now recuperating in a hospital. Just 50 metres from here, BJP MP Rajveer Singh, along with a few other legislators, district magistrate and police officers were at the residence of Chandan Gupta, requesting them to cremate Chandan's body, but the family was struck to their demand of ""status of martyrdom"" for their dead son. The deadlock ended around 2am after the family was given verbal assurance of a government job to a family member and Rs 50 lakh as compensation. However, three days after his death, Chandan's family has received a cheque of Rs 20 lakh. On January 27, Chandan was cremated in the morning and even as his mortal remains were set on the pyre, Kasganj continued to burn. Around 200 meters from the cremation ground, one bus and a shop were set on fire while some locals vandalised a garage. Minutes later, three more buses and three shops were set ablaze by them. All the shops and vehicles were owned by the local Muslim population who till one day ago were living peacefully with the Hindus.  What was shocking was that these incidents were taking place within a range of 500 metres from where hundreds of policemen and two companies of paramilitary forces were standing guard.  As we witnessed, it appeared that a section of the locals belonging to a particular community were given a free hand by the local administration, allowing them to go on a rampage against the minorities.   Parliamentarian Rajveer Singh in a statement to us blamed the Muslims for the clashes. ""Muslims are responsible for this incident. It was pre-planned and they will be dealt with strict action,"" he said. Virendra Tomar, VHP leader, said, ""It's time for us to give a fitting reply to ""love jihad"". If they kill one of us, we will kill 10 of them. The police is our servant and they will work on our instructions."" After several incidents of violence since the morning of January 27, the mob, led by a local VHP leader, took on the policemen. With no courage to face the crowd, a senior police officer called a VHP leader and requested him to ask their cadres to vacate the streets. The VHP leader agreed to the officer's request, but while walking away, he warned the police that within 48 hours, they will ensure that Kasganj is on fire. The political conspiracy was quite clear following the clashes which started on January 26. Now, there was only pressure from the innocent locals and media on the administration and police officers to act.  On January 28, when we confronted the suprintendent of police, Sunil Singh (who has now been transferred), as to why they failed to control the situation, he categorically said, ""This is being done on the instructions of a few people (higher-ups) and I cannot rule out any political conspiracy."" His statement on camera probably cost him his job as he was transferred from Kasganj. Politics over Kasganj violence is at its peak with BJP and VHP leaders making controversial remarks, and parties like the Congress and the Samajwadi Party blaming the BJP for polarisation for the upcoming elections. In this political tussle, the ones suffering are the common people. Situated on the banks of Kala Nadi (Black river), most of the population in Kasganj is dependent on daily business for their survival. With a population of little above one million, Kasganj district has approximately 66 per cent Hindus and 33 per cent Muslims. And in last one decade, there has been no incident of any communal violence. Five days on, Kanganj continues to simmer while politicians are busy trying to cash in on communal sentiments.  ",2018-01-31,"Republic Day,Mohammad Akram,Yogi Adityanath,Kasganj violence",How politics is fanning the communal flames in Kasganj,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kasganj-violence-mohammad-akram-pregnant-wife-district-magistrate-sunil-singh-transferred-yogi-adityanath/story/1/22090.html
539,AVM Manmohan Bahadur,"Technological asymmetry has been an understated cog that goes into deciding victors in interstate conflicts — for, it is finally the image of a victorious soldier, sailor or airman that lingers — on in human memory. While the ""man behind the machine"" is important, there comes a stage where the superiority of warfighting implements overcomes the prowess of a warrior. We have witnessed that when the bow and arrow overcame the mightiest of land warriors only to be overcome itself by the lance; the bow, lance, sword, shield et al were steamrolled when gun powder came on the scene. And so has been the story over centuries leading to tanks, submarines and now air power, whose instruments have become deciding factors in winning battles and affecting the way war progresses. Adverse technological asymmetry has been fatal down history; India is in the dangerous position of getting on the wrong side of the tech asymmetry curve vis-a-vis its neighbours, especially China — this should be lighting up red bulbs in South Block. The Chinese military-industrial complex has matured to a point where it has become the world’s third largest major arms exporter. Though this is especially true in the field of air defence systems, UAVs and mid-capability fighter and transport aircraft. While the J-20 stealth aircraft has been inducted (production rate being ramped to 36 aircraft per year) and is going through its operational paces, there are reports that the J-31 is being converted to become a carrier borne stealth fighter. This would affect Indian naval power adversely as there are no reports of a corresponding development for the Indian Navy, which is still debating after the shelving of the Naval Tejas programme, whether to get more trouble prone MiG-29K for the indigenous aircraft carrier or some other foreign aircraft. The Chinese have produced the sixth Y-20 Very Heavy Transport Aircraft which will become the mainstay of long range airlift as well as the base aircraft for AWACS and inflight refuelling. They have tied up with the Russians for making a new Advanced Heavy Lift helicopter for the Tibetan plateau and have bought from Ukraine, lock stock and barrel, rights to the world’s biggest transport aircraft, the An-225. The massive airlift capability that will accrue to the PLA can well be imagined! Secure communications, that are so vital in war, will become their forte with research being done in quantum technology. Similar advancements are happening in the land and naval armament arena but the advantage that India presently has with its superior aircraft and aircrew over its Northern frontiers may be slowly slipping away. Air power assets do not come cheap and it is necessary that a nation, vying for a seat at the table of the powerful, commits enough monies towards their acquisition. While the depleting squadron strength of the IAF is being regularly debated, it is the other equally vital aspects too that merit government’s attention. We have only three AWACS and six Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA) and no additional ones on the horizon. This writer is witness to the selection of a new FRA in 2009, but the proposal was shot down on ""high"" costs. The reshoot of the project met a similar fate five years hence and now we have floated another tender last week! Will this be cheaper now? No way! Reports from HAL about the ramping up of Tejas are not encouraging and prototype testing of the Tejas Mk1A, eighty-three of which will be bought, is some distance away. The Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft seems a mirage while the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft project is still on the drawing board. The real silver lining is the transport aircraft and helicopter fleets of the IAF that constitute a very potent airlift capability, but these aircraft too are all imported – hopefully, their maintenance contracts are being addressed in time to have adequate availability on the flight line. A healthy combat-ready flight line demonstrates the deterrence that air power affords a nation. The forthcoming national budget is awaited with great anticipation by the armed forces. Technological asymmetry should not be allowed to handicap our first-rate war fighters. : The Economic Survey for 2017-18 brings out the startling fact that India spends only 0.7 per cent of its GDP on Research & Development while China spends 2.1 per cent, the US 2.8 per cent and Israel 4.3 per cent. If the R&D spend is worked out in monetary terms the huge difference between China and India would be abundantly clear as Beijing’s GDP is five times India’s. It is a no-brainer that this is a clear indicator of the fact that technological asymmetry would only increase unless some radical steps are urgently taken by the government to ameliorate the imbalance.

540,Ananth Krishnan,"Last year when reports of India and Japan taking the lead in reviving the “quadrilateral” with the United States and Australia first emerged, Beijing appeared unconcerned. After all, pooh-poohed its strategic experts, the first iteration a decade ago was short-lived and fizzled out. The Quad’s second coming, however, has so far appeared more robust — or robust enough to concern Beijing. Two top officials who travelled to Delhi in December — state councillor Yang Jiechi and foreign minister Wang Yi — both made oblique references to the danger of “small groups” getting together with the aim of containing others. They both also referred to what they saw as unhelpful meddling by the US in the South China Sea and hoped India would continue its “independent” foreign policy. So, when four top naval officials of the Quad countries took the stage together in Delhi in January’s Raisina Dialogue, Beijing duly saw red. Especially when the commander of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, openly called China a disruptor, and Japan’s naval chief Admiral Kawano called for countries to come together to counter Chinese naval expansionism amid muscle-flexing in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The hawkish Chinese tabloid   wrote that “the Raisina Dialogue was elaborately planned to serve as a platform for countries like the US, Japan and Australia, to show their tough stance towards China and Russia, and meanwhile demonstrate India’s position of trying to balance between Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific region, in addition to India’s independent major power status and dissatisfaction with China.” The unprecedented joint attendance of 10 ASEAN leaders, days later at the Republic Day parade in Delhi, further deepened the angst in Beijing, with the same newspaper in an editorial raging that “some members of the Indian elite enjoy engaging in geopolitical bluster. But they cannot truly gauge the reality of India’s comprehensive strength and diplomatic experience. They are beginners playing at geopolitics.” “New Delhi is not Beijing’s major trading partner, and, despite border disputes, is not an imminent security threat to us Chinese,” the editorial said. “However, some Indians keep pestering us, asking us to acknowledge that India is developing better than China.” New Delhi, with a GDP that’s only one-fifth of China’s, has been striving to prevail over Beijing in almost all aspects.” It concluded, “Honestly speaking, Chinese people are not occupied by India.” But apparently occupied enough to warrant a stream of concerned editorials in the state media.

541,Ashley Tellis,"Chandrashekhar Azad and Jignesh Mevani are two of the most   in contemporary Indian social movement history. Both Dalit leaders - one from Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the other from Gujarat - they are charismatic young men who offer possibilities of a new and vibrant Dalit movement in a national landscape as riven by caste as ever. Both are lawyers, both are Ambedkarite - Azad more than Mevani - and both are modern rationalists in the Ambedkarite tradition. To be sure, they are not Dalit Panthers. Azad, despite the fact that he calls his group an army, spends most of his efforts on ensuring education for Dalit children. Mevani works to ensure land officially belonging to Dalits is returned to them. Both are constitutional leaders, believers in the rule of law, anti-violence and careful to defuse any situation that has the potential to turn violent. Despite widespread claims that both either incite or actually preach violence they have been against stoking of conflict between Dalits and Muslims or retaliatory actions against upper caste violence. It is symptomatic of our times that despite this, both are seen as terrifying threats to the Indian state, the media and the right wing middle and upper castes and classes in India - all of which amount to the same thing really.  chief Azad is in jail under a battery of false cases since June 2017. More recently the UP government has   under the National Security Act, an absurd law to invoke in his case. Mevani is constantly attacked in the media, especially since he joined electoral politics and won a seat in Vadgam, Gujarat. Recently he came under fire for refusing to entertain Republic TV in Chennai and for offering a critical appraisal of BR Ambedkar which was predictably and deliberately taken out of context. Why are the two such threats despite being no more than militant liberals? Part of the answer lies in the fact that they have an Ambedkarite pride in their Dalit identity and are very clear that it is their right and duty not to be quiet in the face of caste-based abuse and exploitation. In the feudal state of Uttar Pradesh, Azad and Mevani have emerged as a formidable challenge at a time the threat posed by the   lost both substance and direction. The BJP therefore considers it important to quash them and their politics at all costs. In the deeply communal Gujarat, the mobilisation of Dalits and Muslims by a dynamic leader can spell doom for the dominant BJP. The recent elections and Mevani's thumping victory was a taste of that destabilising effect for the dominant party. Both men are also articulate and not fooled by any of the smokescreen discourses of the dominant party. If Mevani is the more urbane and suave of the two, Azad has a clarity born from being grounded in his location and a compassion that gives his home-grown north Indian machismo an unusual edge. This is why both are an anathema to the mostly inarticulate, unintelligent leaders of the dominant, or indeed, any party. Both men came to prominence over democratic contestations of violence against Dalits. In Mevani's case, it was the atrocity in Una; in Azad's case the atrocity in Shabbirpur. This is really at the heart of the hatred, fear and resentment directed against the two. They are not going to remain silent about atrocities against Dalits and their responses to it are not reactive but proactive, collective and systematic. Mevani has openly spoken in support of Azad, particularly after his arrest. The combination of the two men is more frightening than taking on them individually. Mevani has the theoretical tools and a critical engagement with history, Ambedkarite and otherwise. His speech taken out of the context by the media recently shows that he is neither hagiographic about Ambedkar nor his Communist heroes and knows that historical circumstances have changed and so must theories, even as his primary commitment to their vision remains. Azad has a hands-on engagement with the community which forms the foundation of his politics but his vision is resolutely and uncritically Ambedkarite. Both have much to offer each other and what is important is that both are cognisant of the need to combine theoretical vision and grassroots politics. Mevani sees himself as a social movement activist; Azad sees himself as putting Ambedkarite thinking into action. Both have much to say to each other. But with a hostile state, media and middle class combine, things are not easy for them. The internet Ambedkarites are mostly silent about them, when not critical of them. That is the privilege of internet activists. They do not have to get their hands dirty. It is important for us to nurture these two young men. They are by no means perfect but they are the best we have. On gender, their thinking has not gone very far. On the issue of politics of sexuality, they have not thought much. Neither of them is in touch with his subconscious - both deal mainly with the rational and the legal/constitutional - but it is our duty to widen the scope of their vision. In the mindlessly neoliberal, rabidly anti-intellectual and activism-phobic times we live in, they are reminders that not all is lost. Not fooled by hyper nationalism, grounded in local struggles and unafraid to stand up for who they are, Chandrashekhar Azad and Jignesh Mevani might well be the reasons for us to start thinking again. That they are both really handsome and hot is just an added bonus.",2018-01-29,"Jignesh Mevani,Chandrashekhar Azad,Bhim Army,Dalit politics",Why everyone feels threatened by Jignesh Mevani and Chandrashekhar Azad,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrashekhar-azad-jignesh-mevani-dalit-politics-vadgam-gujarat-bhim-army-br-ambedkar/story/1/22046.html
542,Ashok Upadhyay,"Speaking at the 70th foundation day of the  (NCC), prime minister Narendra Modi said no one would be spared in his drive against corruption. Seeking cooperation of the youth in the battle against corruption and black money, the PM said, “I don’t think any youth of my country is now willing to tolerate corruption. The hate for corruption in the society is visible… I want you to help end corruption that is like a termite."" Countering the general perception that the rich and the powerful mostly get away while the poor get the short shrift in corruption cases, the PM said, “The country used to discuss corruption in despair, the lament being 'no one catches the powerful'. Three former chief ministers are now rotting in jail. Who says there is no justice? No one will be spared."" The prime minister was talking about the three former chief ministers who are currently in jail. While former Bihar chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Jagannath Mishra have been convicted and sentenced in cases related to the fodder scam, former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala is serving a jail term following conviction in a recruitment scam. Three former chief ministers landing in jail on graft charges is certainly unprecedented in seven decades of independent India as far as corruption is concerned. It is also not the norm in a country where the general perception is that the powerful political class is never punished, and are above the law. But going by how the prime minister placed the issue in his speech, it may seem like it was his government which ensured the conviction of these powerful people. But is that truly the case? Let us first talk about the fodder scam cases. In March 1996, the CBI was brought into the case as per the Supreme Court’s order. Lalu Yadav was named as accused in six cases.  The central investigation agency filed chargesheets against Lalu Yadav and 55 other co-accused in 1997.  On 30 September 2013, a special CBI court in Ranchi convicted former Lalu Prasad Yadav and Jagannath Mishra along with 44 others in the case. The court had announced a sentence of five years for Lalu Yadav and four years for Jagannath Mishra. On January 6, Lalu Yadav was again convicted in another fodder scam case and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail. On January 24, a special CBI court in Ranchi awarded five years jail to Lalu Yadav and Jagannath Mishra, this being the third case in which verdict has been pronounced. Barring orders by the courts in the last two cases, nothing has happened after Narendra Modi took over as the prime minister of India. So his or his government’s role is certainly not a factor in sending Lalu Prasad and Jagannath Mishra to jail. In the teacher’s recruitment scam case, in which former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala has been convicted, started in 2003. The Supreme Court ordered a CBI probe. In June 2008, the CBI filed a chargesheet in the court of special CBI judge against 62 people including OP Chautala. In January 2013, the court convicted Chautala and sent him to jail for 10 years. So Om Prakash Chautala was already in jail by the time Modi became the prime minister. It is very clear from the facts that in none of the three court cases involving the three former chief ministers did Modi or his government has a role to play. So while decrying corruption, the PM forgot to clarify that the credit for putting these powerful politicians behind bars was not his for the taking.  Is this not a form of moral corruption, or did the PM not realise what he was implying?",2018-01-30,"Fodder Scam,Black Money,Narendra Modi,Corruption","Modi may be hitting corruption hard, but what has jail for 3 former CMs to do with him?",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/corruption-bjp-modi-black-money-fodder-scam-lalu-yadav-jagannath-mishra-op-chautala/story/1/22062.html
543,Harsh Mander,"Our second day of the Karwan-e-Mohabbat 2018 was India’s 67th Republic Day. We spent this day travelling in remote rural Bengal, meeting families of three young men who were lynched, and their bodies mutilated and dismembered. This was one more lynching in the country that was celebrated by videotaping the killing and circulating the recording triumphantly on social media. It was claimed at that time, by the crowds, the police and even representatives of the ruling party, that a mob of villagers killed them because they were cow thieves. The story we heard in our travels was all too familiar, one troublingly similar to those that we have heard over and over again in the eight states to which the Karwan has travelled so far. It was the evening of the 27th roza fast of Ramazan in Eid on   midsummer last year. Three friends in three different villages in the North Bengal district of Uttar Dinajpur were enjoying the special Iftar meal to break their fasts with their families, in anticipation of the Eid celebrations that were to follow. The friends were all in their mid-twenties. Two were day labourers ready to do any work that was locally offered to them – construction work, farm labour, tea leaf plucking, and whatever else came their way; one was trying to set up a small business. All the three friends were married, with small children. Each of their families reported to us that their mobile phones rang while they were eating. Each said that the young men initially said to whoever called that they were reluctant to leave their family celebrations but finally conceded. They speculate that because the three of them often took petty construction assignments together, perhaps this was what they were called away so urgently for. But they now have no way of knowing for sure. Two of the young men left on their bikes, one walked and was picked up some distance away. They did not return that night. The next morning, each of the families was summoned to the police station. To collect their sons’ savaged bodies, dead and mutilated after mob lynching. The first family we met was in the village Dhulagoch. The young man Nasruddin’s ageing father, Yasin Mohammed, with a white beard, white singlet and blue lungi customary for men of his age, met us weeping. For the hour that we were with him, he would not leave my hand. He was joined by his mother, bent over with age and mourning, the boy’s mother, his widow Anisa and their two small children. The entire family sobbed out loud and long as they shared with us the trauma of his loss six months earlier, and the nightmare of what followed. He used to work in Delhi as a truck driver. After a road accident, his father called him back home. It did not matter if he earned less as work was uncertain and low-paid. At least he was safe and close to home. The morning after he did not return home, a policeman of the village came to their home in civil clothes. He showed them a video of a lynching. To their horror, they could recognise that one of the young men being attacked was Nasruddin. They rushed to the police station, only to be handed his bloodied and defaced dead body. The distraught families of his two friends were also there. We met their families as well in the course of our journey today. Nasirul’s mother Masida Begum and wife Marjina in the village Kutipada; and Samiruddin’s widow in the village Kandapora. Nasirul’s widow gave birth to a daughter months after he had died. Two of the bodies of the young men were lying in an ambulance, and a third on a hospital stretcher. They were disfigured and dismembered, with limbs smashed and crushed, and even their genitals stoned. The police would tell them nothing more than that villagers of a neighbouring Hindu village Durgapur had found them stealing cows. They had caught and in their mass fury lynched them. The families were enraged at the charge of their boys being cow thieves. ""Would anyone in their right mind set out to steal cows on motor cycles?"" they asked indignantly. But they reported that the police was rough with them. Two of the post-mortems were completed before the families arrived. One was done with the family present. The police then handed over the bodies to the families. The dazed and grieving families spent their own money to transport the bodies to their home before they confined each to their graves. After their deaths, some local politicians came to see them, and some people from the local media. A local politician announced that he was convinced that the men were indeed cow smugglers, without offering any proof. No senior officials, to offer help or solace. One family reported that the local block office gave them some grain and a bag of rice. Nothing else. We found the families in extreme want, with their able-bodied bread earners suddenly lost. The families were desperate to know the truth of who had killed their sons and husbands so viciously, and why. We looked at the papers of the cases, and found that the police had registered cases under Section 304, of culpable homicide not amounting to murder; and not murder under Section 302.  The faces of the killers and a large crowd of onlookers were clearly visible in the video they circulated. But only three men were ultimately arrested, and released on bail in just a fortnight because of the lenient sections of the Indian Penal Code under which they had been charged. The families went in delegations to the police station, but report that they were roughly tuned away without answers. They claim that the police threatened that they too would be locked up if they made too much trouble. The villages planned a gherao surrounding the police station. But a local representative of the panchayat – the same who said the men were cow smugglers - dissuaded them. He said that if they did this, it would anger their Hindu neighbours, and might result in Hindu-Muslim riots. It was wise, their representative advised them, to remain silent to avoid trouble in which in the end only they would suffer. They finally accepted this counsel – whether out of voluntary restraint, or despair. We decided that we should try to get some answers from the police to the grieving families. We took representatives from each of the three families with us to the Chopra Police Station. We waited for an hour before the circle inspector agreed to see us. We told him about the Karwan, and our concerns for the families whose sons had been lynched, that they were entitled to know the progress in the investigations into the lynching. I also asked if charges of murder had at least now been instituted against the killers. He said he would not speak to us until he had the permission of the district superintendent of police. He spoke to his superior in our presence and then replied that he was not authorised to give us any answers at all. I asked heatedly how as a public servant, he could turn away the families of the bereaved families. But he was adamant. We left Bengal intensely troubled about how deep the poison of communal hatred has penetrated even a part of India that has maintained greater communal peace after Partition than most others. The villagers in all the three villages to which we travelled said that apart from stray and minor incidents, there had before this been no major incidents of communal tension and violence between Hindus and Muslims of the area before this. All of this lies shattered after the lynching of the three young men, aggravated first by the charge that they were cow thieves, and then the refusal of the state administration to extend to them solace, support or justice of any kind. This is a failure also that I feel compelled to point to, of local civil liberty groups and progressive and secular political parties. My greatest disappointment was to observe that the attitude of the state administration to the victim families whose loved ones had been felled by hate violence was no different from that of the administrations of BJP ruled states. I could easily instead have been in Gujarat, or Rajasthan, or Uttar Pradesh, and not West Bengal. The betrayal of governments of political parties that claim to be secular in failing to defend their minorities rankles painfully and erodes the secular promises of India’s constitution. Today’s was a journey made even more painful because we made it on the day that the Indian government was celebrating its republic with displays of its military might and cultural pageantry. The despair and fear in the eyes of the members of the three families we met on this day in Bengal villages revealed how hollowed out are the promises of India’s republic to its most vulnerable citizens, and how weakly we all defend these.",2018-01-27,"Congress,BJP,Bengal,Hate crimes",Karwan-e-Mohabbat 2018: Lynchings expose the hollowed out promises of India’s republic,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karwan-e-mohabbat-lynchings-hate-crimes-bengal-bjp-congress/story/1/22013.html
544,Kartik Mittal,"Last year, the powerful Arab quartet of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt abruptly announced a diplomatic and economic blockade against another regional pseudo-ally – the state of  . The four countries led the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in accusing Qatar of supporting and funding terrorism and manipulating internal affairs of its neighbouring states. Widely regarded as the most-advanced Arab state for human development by the UN, 85 per cent of the country’s population comprises expatriates, set against just 313,000 Qatari citizens in a population of 2.6 million. Qatar is also a high-income economy, with the world’s third-largest natural-gas reserves and oil reserves. Qatar, which was abruptly shunned by its immediate neighbours, and had little or no indication of the crisis that began as an extension of the Qatar-Saudi proxy conflict. The involvement of the other regional GCC nations, including Bahrain, Egypt and UAE in the blockade further complicated the position to negotiate, as the quartet had a unified and unwavering stance in dedicating the terms for appeasement. The countries cited Qatar's alleged support for terrorism as the main reason for their action, insisting that Qatar has violated a 2014 agreement with the members of the GCC. The GCC also felt threatened by the media arm of Qatar - Al Jazeera - for engaging in what they termed as a ""media conspiracy"" against the nations, and also for the country’s proximity with Iran. Now entering its eight month, the blockade by the GCC nations effectively amounts to economic sanctions on Qatar, which has rendered  , travel, trade and diplomatic restrictions. The effect of these sanctions has been widespread, crippling several companies operating out of the country, and including its citizens and expatriates. The abrupt notice and enforcement of the sanctions had also meant the country was put in a limbo, freezing several of its regional assets and disrupting everyday operations.   As a small gas-rich nation, Qatar has been balancing its trade with heavy dependence on its oil and gas exports for subsidising its food and industrial imports. With its land border with Saudi Arabia closed, Qatar’s food imports initially dropped substantially, before recovering via expensive alternatives. While the allegations against Qatar’s supposed terror-funding has been the prime focal point, in reality, it is also an extension of the regional differences, especially manifested after the network’s coverage since the 2011 Arab Spring. Al Jazeera, the state-funded broadcaster in Doha, was one of the significant nerve-points in the diplomatic blockade, as the GCC members have over the past continued to express distrust over the network’s coverage of the Arab Spring and for “negatively portraying” the local governments. In fact, the complete shutdown of Al Jazeera was one of the terms put forward jointly by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to even commence negotiations. The direct losses incurred by Qatar, along with the indirect losses, would amount to several billion dollars, and the country is already exploring legal avenues to claim compensation from the GCC countries. Several senior ministers have also indicated that Qatar has contracted a specialised legal team to study the actions taken by the blockading countries against it. The country has also been clear in its position on backing Al Jazeera, effectively ruling out any calls for its shutdown.  While the blockade imposed by the GCC is geo-political, efforts by the members in calling for a wider global support, including from the UN is far-fetched. The issue was momentarily complicated when US President Donald Trump took credit for the Saudi-led actions (which was initiated shortly after his visit to the region), but nevertheless it did not gain any traction as international consensus, including from the European Union and the United Nations, among other nations, had called for the resolution of the diplomatic crisis through dialogue. The gas-rich nation has virtually been cornered over its movements - both financially (for its current instruments/investments in the GCC countries) and physically, having to re-rout its land and sea movements via Iran.     Surprisingly, despite all the extreme measures by the GCC quartet to arm-wrestle Qatar, countries, including the UAE and Oman, continue to depend on Qatar’s gas pipeline to power their infrastructure. Qatar continues to pump around two billion cubic feet of gas per day to the UAE, showing no signs of impact from the sanctions.",2018-01-26,"US,Saudi,GCC,Qatar blockade","US-GCC sanctions: One year on, how Qatar is weathering the crisis",https://www.dailyo.in/politics/qatar-blockade-gcc-saudi-us-al-jazeera-donald-trump-arab-spring/story/1/22006.html
545,DailyBite,"In the most anticipated speech of the ongoing World Economic Forum in Davos, the last hurrah as it were, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, outlined his idea of America at the globalist platform, asserting that the two are not at odds with each other. Declaring that ""America First"" - the motto of his nationalist government under the Republican party banner - isn't an automatic route to ""America alone"", Trump dispelled some of the widely held fears that he would hijack WEF's overtly internationalist outlook with his nationalist zeal, upsetting the applecart somewhat.   Instead of railing against the transnational order, Trump trained guns at ""predatory trading practices"", saying each country has the right to safeguard its interests. Hinting at the wide-scale off shoring of jobs and manufacturing by American companies over cheap labour and cost, Trump said he has cut corporate taxes to make America ""open for business"" again, something that wasn't being done since the time of Ronald Reagan, Trump's Republican antecedent.  While the tax cuts are being hotly debated in the US national media, concurrent with other policies of the Trump-led White House, such as depleting medical cover for the poor and the middle classes, immigration tightening and strict regulation of previously lenient visa norms such as the H-1B, etc, the US president waxed eloquent about the stock market boom that has followed since the cuts were announced. Trump also spoke of America being a great investment destination, hard-selling his country against a resurgent Europe under the twin leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump also pitched America as an alternative to obvious Asian markets such as India and China. In fact, parts of Trump's speech sounded similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's keynote address at the opening plenary session on January 23, especially the well-oiled business-friendly pitch. While PM Modi had warned against ""protectionism"", Trump sounded a caveat, saying every country has the right to defend itself economically. However, unlike PM Modi, Trump made no reference to climate change, given his high-profile exit from the Paris climate deal in April last year. He touched upon securing America more in terms of defence spendings, as well as saying that the anti-ISIS coalition has wrested almost 100 per cent of the territories once occupied by the Islamic State.  
 
 President Trump sounded more sober than his usual bombast, though the claims that he made on employment rates among Hispanics, African-Americans and women can be attributed to the policies of the previous Obama administration with its strong affirmative action push. Similarly, the state of the political economy could be gauged from the fact that on the first anniversary of Trump's swearing-in, there was a US government shutdown because the Congress couldn't agree on a federal budget. Not to mention the bad press that Trump is still getting nationally, with some seriously considering if he can be impeached. That said, the expected grouse against ""fake news"" and ""nasty"" media at a global platform was new for the WEF, even though Trump enjoyed a full house, like always. Trump's speech and later interaction with WEF head Klaus Schwab indicate clearly that his anti-immigration policies will continue unabated, making it increasingly difficult for foreign policy experts in India to negotiate a better deal for the expats and NRIs, increasingly courted back home by all political parties. Does Trump's speech ring alarm bells already? Yes, but they are not as loud as we had made them out to be. ",2018-01-26,"United States of America,World Economic Forum 2018,Davos,Donald Trump",'America First' doesn't mean 'America Alone': What Trump said at World Economic Forum,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/donald-trump-davos-world-economic-forum-2018-united-states-of-america/story/1/22009.html
546,Amna Mirza,"Diplomatic relations with China have always been a thorny issue as far as India's global outreach programmes are concerned, especially in its efforts to reach out to neighbouring countries. At a time when the US, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, has been hinting at  , China is trying to take centre stage with its globalisation plans. To understand how this Chinese stance impacts Indian interests, one must look at Beijing's engagement with neighbouring countries. It's an open secret that China is Pakistan's all-weather ally. However, of late, Beijing has been offering submarines to countries along the Indian Ocean coastlines at lucrative prices. Pakistan and China recently announced they will hold joint naval drills in the Indian Ocean regularly. Reports have also surfaced saying China's third domestic aircraft carrier is   in the Indian Ocean. It is pretty evident that Pakistan has consented to self-destruction by agreeing to be a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and trying to bypass the US' strategic encirclement policy that has a military base in Diego Garcia in Indian Ocean and includes the South China Sea. With Pakistan getting loans at exorbitantly high interest rates, imperialist loot and plunder is pretty evident. China has been pretty ruthless in this game of trying to shift the power balance in its own favour. China has invested several billion dollars in building sea lines of communication through Pakistan running far into the Indian Ocean. This is a difficult target to pursue, but that hasn't deterred China from actually going for it. China was critical of the US moving its   in the South China sea, calling it a violation of its sovereignty, and pledged to take necessary measures to protect the same. Beijing took this stand despite the fact that its ships and submarines keep surfacing near Japanese islands, near Taiwan and in the Indian Ocean. China's clout is not restricted to Pakistan, it is growing in the entire Asian region. The country's role in fomenting trouble in Maldives is well-known. Exiled Maldivian Opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed termed Chinese property deals in Maldives as ""land grab"". Chinese influence actually stretches to as far as Australia. It is being said that Beijing's rising display of might in South Asia is in response to India's outings in Southeast Asia. It is indeed great that India can work closely with other nations which are joined by the common thread of Chinese aggression in the region. New Delhi can especially draw support from member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Even though India has been mindful of the Chinese threat, it needs to shore up greater support given that the challenge from Beijing is growing increasingly formidable.",2018-01-25,"Pakistan,CPEC,Donald Trump,Chinese aggression",India must forge deeper ties with ASEAN nations to counter China in Indian Ocean,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chinese-aggression-donald-trump-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-cpec-maldives-pakistan/story/1/21980.html
547,Kaveree Bamzai,"That the right wing in India has no sense of history is being proven daily on the streets of cities across India as Karni Sena and its clones threaten the screening of  . They want to ban a movie they have not seen. And they want to protest the depiction of their clan though they do not know details of how it is portrayed. This is in keeping with their lack of knowledge of history. Or rather, as Audrey Truschke points out in an earlier  for  , the skewed colonial history that was taught to us all. As she notes: ""The story of how Aurangzeb became India’s most maligned king begins in the British colonial period. In brief, the British wanted to point to Indian rulers who were even worse than themselves in order to justify the horrors of colonialism. So they painted a skewed picture of Aurangzeb, often misrepresenting his alleged worst crimes. Many Hindu nationalists today think that hating Aurangzeb is a distinctively Indian feeling, but such sentiments are perhaps more aptly described as a colonial inheritance."" For the right wing, Aurangzeb is seen as the epitome of everything evil. Not only do they see him as a destroyer of temples (though he built more temples than he destroyed), but also as the man who imposed the dreaded jizya tax and disliked music and art. In asking for the boycott of  , the RSS has shown that it is no less than Aurangzeb - they hate the very thing he is said to have abhorred. So, do we become what we hate most? It would seem so. No matter that Aurangzeb's name is sought to be erased by the BJP from Indian history (though he ruled quite successfully for almost half a century) and that no less than Prime Minister Narendra Modi took his name when he spoke disparagingly of Rahul Gandhi recently, he has become the epitome of what a ""bad Muslim"" can be. So, if we are to believe the history that has been taught to us, and is now forwarded through WhatsApps, we should assume the RSS and Karni Sena are Aurangzeb's true heirs. That is also not quite true though - music wasn’t proscribed even in Aurangzeb’s court. The emperor’s own coronation anniversaries were marked by both musicians and dancers. Not only that, his patronisation of music meant that a number of dhrupads were composed in his name. In the  , Bahktawar Khan wrote of the Emperor having a “perfect expert's knowledge” of music. In  , Alauddin Khilji is shown as feeding those pages of history to fire that don't bear his name. If history were to be rewritten to suit those in power, we would have as many versions of it as we have had rulers. Will burning buses and protesting at cinema halls change Rajput history? The irony is that Sanjay Leela Bhansali has made a film that celebrates every virtue the Rajputs hold dear - including a very emotive sequence at the end when Rani Padmavati leads her army of women into the flames, choosing jauhar over falling into the arms of Khilji. Every community has its own idea of its special status. The Rajputs certainly are entitled to it - and, in fact, the movie celebrates that, with Ratan Singh saying "" ,   Rajput;   Rajput;   Rajput."" If their objection is that the film portrays a sort of ""love jihad"", they couldn't be more wrong. Arjun Appadurai speaks of the ""fear of small numbers"", the idea that a small minority is standing in the way of a great people from fully embracing their nationalism. It is exactly what is happening here. Khilji's existence is supposed to stand in the way of Rajput's embracing their idea of who they are, or ought to be.

548,Siddharth Singh,"The   has released the US National Defence Strategy last week, shifting its focus, for the first time in over a decade, from fighting terror to preparing for what it believes is a threat from  and  . The National Defence Strategy (NDS) is an important document which encapsulates the Trump administration’s defence policies in one place for the first time. The NDS bluntly describes a US military that is losing its edge over potential competitors, and urges “increased and sustained investment” for “long-term strategic competitions specifically with China and Russia”. The NDS also identifies three theatres of engagement for the US: the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the West Asia that is consistent with what the Obama administration had been doing towards the end. While the NDS specifically points out that “China is a strategic competitor which is using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbours while militarising features in the South China Sea”, the document blames Russia of violating the borders of nearby nations and pursuing veto power over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions of its neighbours. The unclassified synopsis of NDS 2018 acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment, characterised by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the re-emergence of long-term, strategic competition between nations. The NDS states in clear terms about growing Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific region and states on China ""continues its economic and military ascendance, asserting power through an all-of-nation long-term strategy, it will continue to pursue a military modernization programme that seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global pre-eminence in the future”. The Trump administration had also released its first National Security Strategy (NSS) last month on December 18, 2017. In principle, the strategy which has been outlined in the NSS document charts out the strategic objectives of Trump’s administration and also the ways to meet those strategic aims. The NSS document describes the Indo-Pacific region as the most populous and economically dynamic part of the world and maps it as a stretch from the west coast of India to the western shores of the United States and reinforces its commitment to freedom of the seas and the peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime disputes in accordance with international law in the Indo-Pacific region. The NSS reflects a growing consensus in the US that China is an adversary. The document is a frank acknowledgment of widely shared concerns about China’s rise. It is important here to note that the approach of Trump administration is a far cry from the Obama administration’s 2015 NSS which had welcomed the rise of a “peaceful” and “prosperous” China. In future, a sharp deterioration of China-US ties cannot be ruled out, especially if Washington perceives Beijing as a hindrance when it comes to resolving the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. The Trump administration’s complaint of China’s bullying of other States using “economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, and implied military threats,” echoes fears spreading from Asia to Europe. In the Indo-Pacific region, as far as New Delhi is concerned, the NSS “welcomes India’s emergence as a leading global power and stronger strategic and defence partner”. On the future course of action in the bilateral partnership between the US and India, the document mentions that the US will expand its defence and security cooperation with India which is a major defence partner of the United States, and will also support India’s growing relationships throughout the Indo-Pacific region. There is a specific mention in the document of the much-talked and debated “quadrilateral partnership” among the US, Japan, India and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region, and the NSS puts its stamp on it by mentioning the “Quad” for ""free and open Indo-Pacific"". On the issue of maritime cooperation, Washington has time and again shown its willingness to deepen its strategic partnership with New Delhi and support India’s leadership role in Indian Ocean security and throughout the broader region which is reflective in the cooperation in the Malabar naval exercise. Terrorism in South Asia is one of the biggest challenges among other geopolitical issues and in a direct reference to it, the NSS states that “the US will press Pakistan to intensify the counterterrorism efforts, since no partnership can survive a country’s support for militants and terrorists who target a partner’s own service members and officials”. Overall, the hypothesis of the NSS is based on the principle of realism in international relations as it defines the international system as one of great power competition in which the document specifically points out about Russia and China and portray them as “revisionist powers” challenging the status quo and identifies both the nations as strategic competitors or opponents of the United States. The NSS also criticises past several decades of US foreign policy approach and points out that in past it was shaped by the misguided belief that ""engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners"". This kind of realist framework in the conceptual context needs to be welcomed because it was long overdue departure from previous and successive administrations of the US. Interestingly, the NSS neither makes any mention of China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative nor mentions about the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which together has the potential for a parallel Sino-centric sphere of influence in future. The US needs to shed its obsession with zero-sum trade reciprocity and should come out with a coherent and comprehensive geo-economics strategy if it wants to preserve the US-led rules-based order and counter China’s grand strategy to carve out a parallel Sino-centric order or sphere of influence.  ",2018-01-25,"Defence deals,India-US Ties,US defence strategy",What Trump's new national defence and security strategies mean for India,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/us-national-defence-strategy-security-india-us-ties-defence-trump-obama-administration/story/1/21979.html
549,Minhaz Merchant,"The   between the chief justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra and four Supreme Court collegium justices - J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph - gets curiouser by the day. Despite several meetings to reconcile their differences, the gulf between India’s seniormost justices has not narrowed. What precisely are those differences? At their press conference and in their seven-page letter, the four collegium justices were vague in their demands. For those who want linguistic clarity and brevity from our finest judicial minds, the letter gives little indication of either. Sample this: “ But if all Supreme Court justices are equals, why shouldn’t cases, sensitive or not, be assigned to benches led by “junior” Supreme Court judges? No clear answer has been forthcoming. So what do the four rebel justices really want? First, they want the case relating to the death of judge BH Loya reassigned. That wish has been fulfilled. Justice Arun Mishra was hearing the Loya case. Rattled by the events of last week, he recused himself. The CJI, in a show of authority, reassigned the case to a bench headed by himself. He was under relentless pressure to reassign the Loya case to a bench headed by one of the four collegium justices. He did not. Instead, he even transferred the two PILs related to the case pending in the Bombay High Court to his own bench. Last week, the petitioners’ senior counsel Dushyant Dave had pleaded “with folded hands” against the CJI doing that. The CJI brushed aside Dave’s plea. A group of lawyers and politicians are using the  , as they had earlier used the  , to target BJP president Amit Shah. The confrontation between the Maharashtra government’s counsel Harish Salve and Dave in the CJI’s court on January 22, brought this out into the open. Dave claimed that Salve had defended Shah in the past and should not appear in the Loya case due to conflict of interest. The charge was summarily rejected by the CJI’s three-judge bench.   Salve has, meanwhile, submitted medical documents and other material to the Supreme Court to show that judge Loya’s death occurred due to natural causes. The CJI has posted the next hearing in the case for February 2. But amid the judge Loya clamour, the case that lurks in the background is about building the  . Like Banquo’s ghost that haunted Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the Ram temple case haunts the Supreme Court. The long drawn-out case is now with a bench headed by the CJI. He retires on October 2, 2018. There is an expectation that the CJI wants to deliver a verdict in the case before he demits office. The same powerful group of lawyers, activists, politicians and sections of the media that has shown exceptional interest in the judge Loya case fears that the CJI could be inclined to rule in favour of building the Ram temple in Ayodhya where the Babri mosque stood. Such a ruling would benefit the BJP in three big states due to go to the polls in December 2018: Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. All three states will feature binary BJP-Congress contests. All three face strong anti-incumbency. A pro-temple ruling would give the BJP a steroid boost ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election.  Two outcomes can now be divined. First, a chastened CJI, buffeted by the collegium’s rebellion, will postpone a verdict on the Ram temple case till after the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, citing its sensitivity. Second, the CJI could rule against  building the Ram temple where the Babri mosque stood and instead suggest the construction of two new structures, a temple and a mosque, side by side. That would suit the Opposition ahead of 2019. All of these well-laid plans though may amount to nothing. Even if the Supreme Court’s verdict goes against building the Ram temple, or the verdict is inordinately delayed, the anger that it will spark among devout Hindus will be electorally fissile. In the end, therefore, the elaborate shenanigans we have been witness to in the Supreme Court over the past two weeks could end in a whimper. But the spotlight it has shone on the apex court and its hallowed innards will have served a purpose.  Why, for example, haven’t the senior justices of the Supreme Court shown similar ire, as they have over assignment of cases, against the real issues that bedevil India’s judicial system: deep-seated corruption, shambolic infrastructure, a mounting backlog of cases, lawyers holding clients to ransom with adjournments, and the opaque collegium system of appointing judges to the Supreme Court by other Supreme Court judges? Such opacity hardly inspires confidence in India’s top judicial minds as they wrestle with the fissure within their ranks and Banquo’s ghost that hovers silently over the unbuilt Ram temple in Ayodhya.",2018-01-24,"Amit Shah,Modi,Elections,Ram mandir",Why Ram temple issue is lurking behind crisis in Supreme Court,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-judge-loya-ram-mandir-2019-modi-amit-shah-congress/story/1/21953.html
550,Aruna Chandrasekhar,"Given the surreal times that we live in, it's always reassuring to hear world leaders reaffirm that climate change is still real for them. This time it was   at Davos, acknowledging climate change as one of the biggest threats to the world as we know it.  It was a statement in keeping with India's strong positioning as a climate leader and doing more than it should. But that we are bending over backwards to set ambitious climate goals - given our history as being a site of colonial pillage - is a point I wish he drove home without constantly having to bring yoga into it.  Sustainable lifestyles make for great soft power sell at Davos, but not when you are the world's second-largest coal consumer and third-largest emitter, with a capital that's not particularly conducive to ""pranayama"". In his speech, Modi spoke of glaciers and ice-caps melting. I wish he'd spoken of the impacts closer home -  , caught off guard by  , agrararian suicides in a year where average rainfall dropped five per cent and devastating floods that took over a thousand lives in the sub-continent. Modi's speech is also dangerously disingenuous. Just last month, as air quality readings peaked across the country, his government   to duck installing essential pollution control technology for another five years. Over 200 coal projects - many of them greenfield - still lie on the top of his office's  . It was only because of a case filed by air pollution activist Sunil Dahiya that    have been put on hold, unless they comply with new emission norms. Dahiya is a campaigner with Greenpeace, an organisation the present government has relentlessly persecuted for calling out the excesses of coal culture. Modi's call for rich nations to do their bit and arguments against protectionism struck the right notes, as developed countries must demonstrate they can put their money where their mouth is, beginning with their commitments to the Kyoto Protocol which turned 20 last year. India deserves, and is due to all, the finance and technology in helping it fulfil its most daring gigwatt goals, and to build climate adaptation capacity. But this must be finance that is easy to access. To win a project under  , for instance, is nearly impossible, making one wonder what Make In India the government is hoping to seed fund from its unique carbon tax. While the international press saw Modi's protectionism diatribe as directly   America-centricism - the latest being a 30 per cent tariff imposed on foreign-made solar cells and modules - the Indian government is currently mulling imposing one, putting Operation Suryanamaskar's success in peril. For Modi to invoke Mahatma Gandhi's spin on natural resources while making an elevator pitch at Davos was a stretch even by his standards. For one, his government's continued expansion of Coal India's mines towards a 1.5 billion target has been the opposite of the kid-glove-meets-swadeshi kind of trusteeship,   to forcibly grab indigenous land, while  that allow for local trustees to have any say in the matter. Two, his government's coal auction regime has not been a vast improvement, with ghosts of cartelisation returning, conflicts around land and pollution that were never   and mines unable to get off the ground. Instead, contract mining has become the default way to go, with the state taking on the bidding and regulatory prep work, while private miners like the   rake in the profits without the exposure. By the looks of it, neither   nor   have benefitted the least from three and a half years of Modi's custodianship. If Modi really wants Davos and the world to believe in India taking the lead on climate change, he needs to shed his telling proximity to the fossil fuel industry, acknowledge and fix the haze at home, announce the no-go zones in India's forests and wetland buffers, strengthen laws that empower communities with the lowest carbon footprint and make clean energy R&D accessible, without doing away with essential laws and protections.  All else is ""pawanmuktasana"" for the international press.",2018-01-24,"India,Climate change,Davos,PM Modi",Why Prime Minister Modi's talk of climate change in Davos was hogwash,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/davos-pm-modi-climate-yoga-change-pollution-trump-indias-coal-culture-clean-energy/story/1/21948.html
551,Kiran Tare,"Uddhav Thackeray was searching for a “villain” he could blame for the Shiv Sena’s decision to go solo in the next Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. He found one in the form of BJP national president Amit Shah. Thackeray claims that Shah sidelined the other constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) while setting a target of 380 seats for the next Lok Sabha election. “Why the astonishment over Shiv Sena’s stand to go solo in the elections?” Thackeray asked in party mouthpiece   on January 24. Thackeray compares the Shiv Sena with the army of Maratha emperor Chhatrapati Shivaji: “The Maratha warrior didn’t worry about the vast empires of the Muslim rulers, their unlimited sources of wealth even though he himself didn’t have enough money to pay his army men.” However, it seems he has not taken lessons from Shivaji’s guerrilla war tactics. True to his impulsive nature, Thackeray has revealed his strategy much before the country can go into the election mode. He has given the BJP ample time to formulate its strategy ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election without his party’s support. Interestingly, it was the BJP that had kept Thackeray in the dark about the future of their alliance when the former had unilaterally announced a break up two days before the nomination for Assembly polls began in September 2014. “A mature leader never lets his rivals know his strategy much in advance. Uddhavji should have waited for some time,” says a Shiv Sena leader. Voters will not trust Thackeray’s intention to take on the BJP until he proves his credibility by quitting the coalition government. His criticism regarding the government’s failure on issues like loan waiver to farmers will not carry weight till he remains a key player of the government. The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have begun chiding him for sticking to power rather than dismantling the alliance. Traditionally, the Thackerays are not known to be open-hearted. Shiv Sena workers are not sure whether they will get monetary support from the party for their work during elections. Around six months ago, the Shiv Sena had fielded Tanaji Sawant, a wealthy Mumbai-based businessman, in the Legislative Council elections from the faraway Yavatmal constituency, declining loyal but poor workers the opportunity to contest polls. Sawant secured a comfortable victory that upset party loyalists. Bring this into the equation, and it is highly possible Thackeray will choose candidates with money instead of those who have been toiling for the party for many years. Ordinary Shiv Sena workers have gone into political hibernation since Thackeray joined the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in December 2014. The chief does not have any programme to infuse enthusiasm into them. The moment any Shiv Sena worker expresses his dissent over the functioning of the government, a patent question is thrown at him: why is he complaining if he is a part of the government? The Shiv Sainiks have been caught in a Catch-22 situation. They feel they are in the government but the BJP has ensured that they do not get any benefit of the power. Thackeray will have to come up with a detailed roadmap to revive the party — at present, he does not have any. Thackeray has announced that Shiv Sena will contest elections in every state on the Hindutva plank. The ground reality, however, paints no rosy picture. In Maharashtra, north Indians and Gujaratis will vote for the BJP on the Hindutva plank as the Shiv Sena has time and again taken a hard stand against these communities. For north Indians, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath is a bigger Hindutva icon than Thackeray. The Gujaratis do not consider anyone Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s equal — he remains the biggest Hindutva idol. The Marathi-speaking voters, on the other hand, will rally behind the Shiv Sena as they are divided in other parties — BJP, Congress and the NCP. It is important to note that Hindutva supporters disapprove of Thackeray’s growing closeness with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee whom they consider anti-Hindutva owing to her politics of appeasement. The Shiv Sena is not a dominant force outside the Konkan and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra. In Mumbai, it will have a close contest with the BJP should the two parties fight the polls separately. Thackeray has failed to take Shiv Sena to new heights in western Maharashtra, north Maharashtra and Vidarbha, the regions where half of the Assembly seats are consolidated. Uddhav’s decision to go solo in the election is certainly aimed at energising depressed Shiv Sena workers, but it will not get him sweeping power. Who will he blame then?",2018-01-24,"Shiv Sena,Lok Sabha elections 2019,Uddhav Thackeray,Maharashtra",Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to go without BJP in 2019 general elections will be disastrous,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uddhav-thackeray-shiv-sena-lok-sabha-elections-2019-maharashtra/story/1/21949.html
552,TS Sudhir,"The   could well be mistaken for the latest season of ""MasterChef Karnataka"". What else explains the obsession of both the Congress and the BJP to reduce the political battle to all things culinary? At a time when the man on the street is grappling with bread and butter issues, the political cooks are serving him beef biryani instead. The B-word was introduced into the Kannada electoral lexicon by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who many in the BJP believe is the man who could ensure distribution of laddoos on verdict day in May 2018. He slammed his Karnataka counterpart Siddaramaiah, mocking his Hindu self, deriding his choice to   despite his religious identity. The Congress hit back with a video that spoke of how Yogi is a recipe that the BJP has prepared to stir trouble in Karnataka. The video made references to the criminal cases against Yogi and the BJP was not amused. Plagiarism is the name of the game so a week later, the BJP too chose the same culinary metaphor to show Siddaramaiah and Karnataka Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao as chefs, out to prepare beef biryani. The ingredients in this case, according to the makers of the video, included ""illegal beef from a slaughterhouse"", ""rotten rice"" given as part of the PDS, the inability to solve the Cauvery and Mahadayi river water sharing crisis, killings of Hindu youths and alleged corruption in the building of a steel flyover in Bengaluru. But the real reason behind calling it ""beef biryani"" was to stress the appeasement of the minorities under Siddaramaiah. On Monday, the Congress beefed up its rhetoric by expanding the BJP to ""Beef Janata Party"", inspired from Gabbar Singh Tax, perhaps. The attempt was to expose the hypocrisy of the BJP which adopts different positions on consumption of beef in different states. For example, while it does not breathe a word about its anti-beef position in a beef-consuming Meghalaya that goes to polls next month, it wants to put the Congress on the mat in Karnataka by making it a poll issue. The video also spoke of Goa that under BJP's Manohar Parrikar wants to import beef and UP's BJP MLA Sangeet Som, who reportedly runs a meat processing unit. The reason for the BJP raising the decibel levels over its love for the cow goes back five years, when the party was in power in Karnataka. In 2010, the then BJP government had passed the Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill. Siddaramaiah, then in the Opposition had dramatically torn a copy of the Bill, accusing Yeddyurappa of behaving like ""Hitler's regime"" and ""imposing a vegetarian"" culture on the people of Karnataka. His argument was that by banning beef, mutton would become prohibitive. Three years later, when Siddaramaiah became CM, one of his first decisions was to overturn the beef ban. The 1964 Cattle Preservation Act was restored under which slaughter of cows, calves and buffaloes was banned. The Yeddyurappa Bill had banned the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and imposed harsh punishments for violators of the law. By making beef a poll issue, the BJP wants to jog the memory of voters on Siddaramaiah's conduct, hoping to sway the vegetarian Kannadiga and the orthodox Hindu on to its side. This is because even while standing his ground on his right to decide what food will be on his plate, Siddaramaiah has emphasised that he is  . ""There is both Siddha and Rama in my name,'' he declared, raising the spectre of a Gujarat-like temple run in Karnataka by the Congress led by Rahul Gandhi. The Congress, having seen the results of running a Hindu-ised Gujarat campaign, wants to ensure the BJP does not pitch its tent as the sole spokesperson of the Hindus in Karnataka. The BJP's assessment is that controversial planks like beef ban will find traction in pockets of Karnataka, especially the communally sensitive coastal belt. The intention also is to provoke the Muslim voices in the Congress to speak up, so that it will give the BJP a chance to label the ruling party as batting solely for the minorities. So far, the Congress has ensured it does not fall into the trap, trying instead to pick holes in the BJP's policy of different strokes in different states. But what is certain is that the beef recipe will only bring a divisive election on the menu and that won't do Karnataka any good.",2018-01-23,"Congress,BJP,Beef Ban,Karnataka elections",BJP vs Congress: Who will get the beef recipe right in Karnataka polls?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-elections-siddaramaiah-yogi-adityanath-beef-ban-bjp-congress/story/1/21918.html
553,Valay Singh Rai,"At a dimly lit internet cafe in one of the several urban villages of Delhi, two Class 12 students, sporting latest hairstyles and faux designer labels, are getting their school projects printed. Sushant’s submission is on the Goods and Services Tax (GST); his friend Sumit struggles to translate his project title into English. The irritable cafe owner is in a hurry to move on to his other customers. “Write the title in Hindi -   (the crisis of unemployment),” Sumit tells him.  The boys study in a government school in south Delhi’s Swamy Nagar, a posh neighbourhood that houses many of the 1 per cent Indians who have come to acquire 73 per cent of the wealth generation in India in 2017. The boys on the other hand belong to the 14-18 years age group that constitute 11 per cent (100.2 million) of India’s population of 1.2 billion people. They form a huge chunk of our much-touted (and neglected) demographic dividend of 390 million millennials and the 12 million young people who join the workforce every year. A week ago, the   (ASER) was released by Pratham. Titled ""Beyond Basics"", the latest report is a welcome departure from the past as it looks at rural youth in 14-18 age group, through the lenses of - activity, ability, awareness, and aspirations. Earlier, ASER reports have brought out in stark detail the poor learning levels of children in the schooling system. It is thanks to this annual survey, we now know that while school enrolment has gone up to more than 95 per cent, learning levels of children in government schools are woeful. Most Class 3 students are unable to Class 2-level text. The findings of "" "" are a stinging slap to policymakers and state governments of the 24 states that formed part of the    The worst indictment is for the union government, which has been stubbornly resisting the extension of the Right to Education Act from 14 years to 18 years.  So far, only primary school education in India is a legal right, which is why primary school enrolments have shot up to more than 90 per cent. Groups like the   have been demanding that secondary school education should also be made a legal right as most children tend to ""drop out"" after Class 8. The latest survey confirms once again that the urgent need is to make the entire 12 years of schooling a legal right. The survey has thrown up worrisome trends that belie the media frenzy over Skill India, Digital India, Start Up India, Make in India, and Ek Bharat, Shreshta Bharat. Consider this: Out of 100 children in Class 7 only half of them continue to study till Class 10. And only 25 per cent of them go on to complete Class 12. Less than 10 per cent of the youth surveyed in the ""Beyond Basics"" report were enrolled in undergraduate or other degree courses. Nearly 30 per cent of all youth are not enrolled in either a school or any other educational course. The prime minister, who is in   to tell the world’s business tycoons that ""India means business"" ought to bear in mind the complete failure of his government’s Skill India programme. According to the ASER report, only 5 per cent of youth are ""taking some type of vocational training or other courses"". Just 5 per cent. That’s less than the proportion of such youth in Sri Lanka and Nepal, leave alone the rest of the world. For the RSS and its supporters, the ancient golden age of ""Bharat"" is an ever-present model to attract ordinary Indians to their fold. ""India will once again become the world’s teacher"" - this promise is often heard from RSS men, BJP leaders and ministers alike. While a lie can possibly be turned into truth by repeating it ad nauseam, the same doesn’t hold true for grand promises. Last year, the central government  . This month, the Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE) once again stalled the demand for the extension of the RTE Act. Moreover, there is a shortage of 9.4 lakh teachers in government schools where the poorest children study. In Uttar Pradesh, for example, only half of all secondary school teacher posts have been filled. In Bihar and Gujarat, one third of them are vacant. Among the other alarming findings of the ASER report is the abysmal ""awareness"" level of India’s rural youth. Less than half of them were unable to locate their own state on the map. Only 64 per cent of them knew that Delhi is India’s capital and nearly 14 per cent of them didn’t recognise India’s map. The prime minister, especially believes in the power of apps and internet, but again, the bulk of India’s youth are deprived of access to the new knowledge-based economy. The   says that  only ""28 per cent had used the internet and 26 per cent had used computers in the last week, while 59 per cent had never used a computer and 64 per cent had never used internet"". If we divide this on the basis of gender, we find that girls are lagging in internet usage also. The report found that, “while 49 per cent  of males have never used the internet, close to 76 per cent of females have never done so”. The proportion of mobile phone users was predictably higher at 73 per cent for all youth, here too more females (22 per cent) had never used a mobile phone as compared to males (12 per cent). If a ""Beyond Basics"" kind of survey is conducted among the youth who scaled the court complex in Udaipur and planted a saffron flag in the wake of the gruesome communal murder of migrant labourer Afrazul, the results are likely to be in consonance with the general findings of the actual report. Incidentally, Udaipur was the only district where the survey was conducted in Rajasthan. The findings for Udaipur are depressing, 96.8 per cent of the youth surveyed were not enrolled in any vocational course, less than half of them could do basic arithmetic, or recognise their own state on the map of India. This pattern repeats itself across different states. The crux of the ASER survey is clear. Most of India’s youth are uneducated, deprived of access to skills of the future, and live in abject hopelessness. In the absence of free and compulsory education till Class 12, many of the rural youth are forced to discontinue their education over reasons ranging from death in the family to the wedding of a sibling even as education is prioritised over practically everything in middle class Indian families. The whole family works in mission mode to ensure that their children ace their competitive exams and join a professional course, while the laggards make up by buying seats in colleges. On the other hand, in the other India which lives in villages and small towns, the youth lives in a deep and dark well which is illuminated by TV and mobile phones. In the absence of role models (40 per cent said they have none), their lives are a dark vacuum which can be easily filled by destructive, if not exhilarating purposes. The demographic dividend is real and inevitable, but are we as a country prepared to constructively engage the youth is the question that should be bothering our government? Because if the government continues to look at school education as business as usual, and ignore education, skills and employability of the future Indian workforce, then the demographic dividend will surely turn into a demographic disaster.",2018-01-23,"RTE,Modi,Demographic dividend,ASER report",India's demographic dividend is turning into a disaster,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-demographic-dividend-aser-education-slap-davos-skill-india-rte/story/1/21919.html
554,Kiran Tare,"When he was inducted into the Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government in 2014, Chandrakant Patil was considered a man for all seasons because of his ability to handle a number of issues besides his clean image. Three and a half years later, the revenue minister has become the epitome of goof-ups and misplaced priorities. Most recently, Patil found himself at the centre of controversy when he recited a Kannada song praising Karnataka, where he attended the inauguration of a Durga temple in Belgaum district. Patil opened his speech with ""Huttidare Kannada Nadalli Huttabeku (roughly translated as ""One should be born in Karnataka if one is born at all"")"". As expected, the Opposition is demanding Patil’s head for “insulting Maharashtra in Karnataka”. The controversy assumes political relevance owing to Maharashtra's long-pending border dispute with Karnataka. Belgaum is the centrepoint of the chorus for the demand for the merger of Karnataka’s Marathi-speaking border areas with Maharashtra. Patil has effectively given the Opposition an opportunity to target the state government for its “double standards” over the decades-old issue. “We were aware of the BJP’s affection for Gujarat. Now, it has developed love for Karnataka. Chandrakant Patil has stabbed the people of Maharashtra in the back,” said Nationalist Congress Party leader Ajit Pawar. He even asked for the minister's resignation in a tweet. 
 
 Patil has become a habitual offender when it comes to breaking Marathi hearts. Only two weeks ago, he had raised questions over the competence of BJP workers in the state. Speaking at a conclave of teachers in Beed, Patil had said it had become difficult to find leaders of character for various important posts in the party. “We won’t find such people even if we look for them with binoculars,” he had said, in an apparent dig at ""incompetent"" BJP workers. He had also found himself in a spot in October 2017 when he provided wrong information about the ownership of two flats in the possession of state Congress president Ashok Chavan’s daughters – Shrijaya and Sujaya. While he has apologised to BJP workers over his remarks in Beed, Patil clarified that he spoke in Kannada recently as the native audience could grasp only that language.  The goof-ups are likely to hamper his political career, considered bright till a couple of months ago. A smear campaign has already been conducted within the BJP to curtail Patil’s phenomenal political growth. He was an office-bearer at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Kolhapur office till 2010, when the BJP inducted him full time and made him contest the legislative council election from the graduates’ constituency. Patil secured a comfortable victory but kept a low profile, following his Sangh ideals. His stature in the party started growing since Amit Shah became BJP's national president. Both of them share very good relations since Shah’s wife comes from Patil’s hometown Kolhapur. Patil has had close ties with Shah’s in-laws since his days in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in late '80s. He became number two in the Fadnavis Cabinet following the ouster of then revenue minister Eknath Khadse, who was the party's most senior face. On at least three occasions, when there were speculations over Fadnavis being replaced as the CM, Patil emerged as a frontrunner for the coveted post. First, it was the outcry of the Maratha community demanding reservation in education and government jobs. Later, the unprecedented agitation by farmers demanding a better price for their produce and, recently, the protests by Dalits following clashes at Bhima Koregaon on January 1 made Patil feel that he stood a chance to lead Maharashtra in the event Fadnavis is asked to step down for “mishandling” the crisis. It created the impression that Patil, a Maratha, could succeed Fadnavis, a Brahmin. The situation has rapidly changed and an impulsive Patil alone is responsible for that. He has become the target of detractors within the BJP. A source in the party claims that a whispering campaign has been engineered over Patil’s caste. Some have started circulating a message that says Patil is a Jain not a Maratha. It points out that there are many Jains in western Maharashtra, especially in Kolhapur and Sangli, who carry Marathi surnames like Patil. That Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, the founder of Rayat Shikshan Sanstha, a major education trust in Sangli, was a Jain. The message asks what Chandrakant Patil has done for the welfare of Maratha students as the head of a committee constituted to deal with issues pertaining to the community, such as reservation and scholarships. If the message is an indication, it is the beginning of the decline of Patil’s influence.",2018-01-23,"BJP,Maharashtra,Chandrakant Patil",Why Chandrakant Patil is facing the heat in Maharashtra BJP,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrakant-patil-kannada-belgaum-devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-bjp-rss/story/1/21920.html
555,Subhash Kak,"There was an outcry in the Indian media last week when  , minister of state for human resource development, reportedly said: ""Darwin's theory (of evolution) is scientifically wrong. It needs to change in school and college curriculum. Since the man is seen on earth, he has always been a man."" He was speaking to reporters in Aurangabad at the All India Vaidik Sammelan. He reportedly added: ""Nobody - including our ancestors - has said they saw an ape turning into a man. No books we have read or the tales told to us by our grandparents had such a mention."" Indian scientists are shocked that the minister should speak thus against the idea of evolution which is fundamental to biology and medicine. How can the HRD minister be so ill-informed about science? This is all the more puzzling since he was a senior police officer before entering politics. Was the minister merely trying to be nice to the traditionalists at the Vaidik Sammelan, and he has no strong views on the matter, and perhaps the HRD ministry is safe under his leadership? My own thinking is that he is genuinely misinformed because, in reality, the idea of evolution (more general than Darwinian Evolution) is basic to all Indian thought, which is something that he does not appear to know. The least he can do is to understand both modern evolution theory and Indian ideas on it and then see how the education system in India can help people know the history of Indian ideas as well as the foundations of modern science. The Sankhya is the Indian theory of evolution, which is supposed to apply both to the individual and the cosmos. In it, the basic entities are pure consciousness and materiality (nature). Nature has three constituent qualities (gunas) called sattva, rajas, and tamas, and as the balance between these three changes the universe evolves. Out of the interplay of the five basic elements arise other principles (tattva): five subtle elements, five action senses, five senses of perception, mind, egoity, and intellect. The evolutionary sequence goes through many levels. The tattvas help in the emergence of life out of inert matter. The gu?as are not to be taken as abstract principles alone. Indian thought believes that structure in nature is recursive, and the gu?as show up in various forms at different levels of expression. The texts imply that ingredients for the growth of life are available throughout the universe. Infinite number of universes are conceived, so each new one is created like a bubble in an ocean of bubbles. The tattvas are not discrete and their varying expression creates the diversity of life in and across leading different species. Each sensory and motor tattva is mapped into a corresponding organ. Indian thought conceives of 8.4 million species, which is an impressive number, considering modern authorities estimate the number of extant species to be 4.5-10 million. Physicist Erwin Schrödinger thought that the S?nkhyan tattvas were the most plausible model for the evolution of the sensory organs. A quote on evolution on earth from the thousand-year-old, encyclopedic Yoga Vasistha (YV): Indicating the presence of other animals while the giant asuras were on earth, YV suggests that man arose later. YV also speaks of minor ages of destruction on earth that correspond to the yugas. The Indians believed that all life can be divided into three classes (Chandogya Upanishad 6.3.1): ""In truth, beings have here three kinds of seeds, born from the egg, born alive, and born from the germ."" Given that it is also affirmed that life on other planets exists and that there was a gradual rise of life on the earth, it would appear that this implied a belief in a panspermia theory. Why aren't Indian ideas on evolution known to educated Indians? We see that Satyapal Singh did not need to deny evolution just to be on the right side of the remembered Indian tradition. The question then is: Why are the minister and other Indians ill-informed about their own sciences? India is the only major nation where history of science is not integrated in the school and college curriculum. People pick up bits and pieces on it from a variety of sources, such as tangential references in religious texts, and other sources many of which are unreliable or plain wrong. Superstitions arise in the absence of right knowledge and sunlight dispels darkness. A course on history of Indian science in colleges and universities will go a long way in presenting Indian scientific ideas to the next generation, and help people distinguish scientific ideas from mythology and fiction. The history of Indian science is not a politically divisive issue as it is not teaching religion or ritual. Why can't the HRD ministry take leadership on this issue?",2018-01-22,"Chandogya Upanishad,Scientific thought,Human evolution,Satyapal Singh",What Hindu tradition says about evolution,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/satyapal-singh-human-evolution-apes-scientific-thought-chandogya-upanishad/story/1/21888.html

The court referred to an earlier incident when the complainant and Farooqui kissed despite the presence of Farooqui's wife in the house. The bench mistakenly thought that the incident is of the same day, but advocate Vrinda Grover informed that the instance of kissing did not happen on the day of the incident. The bench went into a discussion on whether the complainant faked an orgasm which could have led Farooqui to believe that she gave her consent. The bench asked: ""So, how did she communicate that she didn't have the  ? The lawyer responded by saying that the complainant said no several times. The judge interjected by saying, ""Initially yes, but later there is a response wherein she says she faked (orgasm). People give fake smiles all the time. But how could the alleged accused know it was fake. She said she was afraid but what she did was completely contrary to someone who would be afraid."" The court insisted Vrinda Grover read the email written by the complainant to the accused after the incident, which talks about how the complainant felt her sexual autonomy is violated, how Farooqui became forceful and how she ""went along"" because she was scared. The complainant also told Farooqui how his behaviour was inappropriate and went on to say, ""I love you and wish well for you but.."" The court picked on this line: ""Ms Grover in how many cases have you seen the victim saying I love you to the accused."" The lawyer tried to explain how it happens in cases where parties have known each other and victims are still coming to terms with their trauma. The court dismissed the plea. There are two grounds on which the court primarily dismissed the appeal against the high court judgment. The first was whether the absence of consent was properly communicated to Mahmood Farooqui as the parties were known to each other and had a history of kissing each other. The apex court seems to believe that because the complainant faked an orgasm towards the end of the sexual activity, it gave the defendant a presumption of consent. This argument is flawed. First, if the complainant had repeatedly   when the sexual activity began then faking an orgasm at the end cannot be conclusive proof that she consented. Consent in law is understood as the ability and freedom to make choices. The victim says she feared for her safety hence she ""went along"". This issue was dealt with in case of Doyle (2010) by the Court of Appeal in UK. The court came to the conclusion that the fact that the victim ""just let him get on with it"" was held to be no consent as there was a fear of harm. In this case one can argue that the fear of harm was not immediate. Most common law countries follow this proposition. One can of course debate whether the threat of harm was immediate or imminent or whether the complainant was reasonable in holding such a belief. But the mere faking of an orgasm towards the end cannot be conclusive for Farooqui to reach the conclusion that she consented. Let's move to the aspect of the proximity or the relationship between the parties. Both knew each other and had exchanged kisses earlier. But the past sexual conduct cannot be at any stage adduced as evidence for consent unless it can be directly established that it impinges upon the right of fair trial for the defendant. The test for adducing the evidence of past sexual conduct is pretty high even under the Indian law. It cannot be brought forth in ordinary circumstances, at least the law doesn't say so. In such a scenario for the bench to make observations like ""she knew him well enough to make a drink for him"" or ""how many times she visited the house alone"" raise some disturbing questions. I wonder, whether the sexuality of a woman continues to be on trial. The bench did clarify that they were not implying that making a drink or visiting someone's house gives one the right to rape, but having such questions is in itself problematic in a deeply violent and patriarchal society. The language used in a rape trial is an important component in the entire process of delivery of justice. At no point did the court delve into the fact that the defendant was intoxicated. Was he capable of understanding the verbal and non-verbal cues of the complainant? Why wasn't the conduct of the defendant who was arguably in a position of trust not questioned at any point? Now to the second and more disturbing aspect, which is of the email sent on March 30, 2015, two days after the incident. It is true that the complainant does say that ""I love you…"" but here is the full text of that email:  (Source: Judgment of Delhi HC). Few days later, on April 12, 2015, the complainant writes another mail which literally abuses Farooqui for the trauma and pain and how the experience has been haunting her ever since. These mails should be understood in the proper context. This is an account of a woman who is still coming to terms with what has happened with her. As women, we often deny our realities unless they start haunting us. This is very well documented especially in cases where the victim and offender have known each other. The words ""I love you"" should not be misconstrued without proper context and understanding. This is not about a lawyer weighing her each and every words, imagining this to be used as evidence in court, but rather a woman who is finding it difficult to accept the reality in the wake of a saexual assault. Eventually it is for the courts to decide whether there was consent or not and yes the case of Farooqui is a difficult one. But the case has to be dismissed or admitted for the right reasons and in cases of sexual assault one can't ignore the language of it. The language is as important as the substance.",2018-01-22,"Consent,Mahmood Farooqui case,Supreme Court,Sexual assault",How the courts failed in interpreting consent in Mahmood Farooqui rape case,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mahmood-farooqui-case-consent-sexual-assault-orgasm-supreme-court/story/1/21891.html
557,Angshukanta Chakraborty,"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for Davos to attend and address the  , the annual meeting in praise of global capital and globalisation, of reading the world as an interconnected place of interlocked economies and nations – seems poised at a cliffhanger. With the one-of-a-kind American president in Donald J Trump, whose protectionist   motto is exactly the opposite of what WEF has stood for, there’s bound to be “clashes”, if not among personalities, at least among competing ideas at the forum in the snow-clad Swiss Alps, despite the   on the mountains, thanks to India. With both Modi and Trump scheduled to give keynote addresses – Modi at the opening plenary session on   and Trump on the last day,   – it seems the organisers have tried their best to avoid awkwardness, and any hijacking of the forum by Trump with his anti-globalist ideas. While there have been protests against WEF by the anti-globalisation activists of the left, environmentalists, anti-capitalists from Europe and Latin America, the concern about Trump is unique, since it’s the US president this time, usually a force of globalisation and undeterred flow of global capital, who is spewing policies and ideas that are clearly in the “far-right” of the socioeconomic spectrum. On the other hand, despite immense criticism at home, Prime Minister Modi, who’s the first Indian PM to make an official trip to Davos after two decades since former   went in 1997, stands for pitching India as a global investment destination, even though it’s not going to be the easiest of tasks. With the investment-to-GDP ratio dipping at home, and the economic indicators that were paraded by the government, such as the   and the World Bank  , both having faced  , thereby stealing Modi’s thunder somewhat with hard data, the task has become more uphill. In fact, India is that rare big emerging economy that has seen its  , while the world economy as such showed a healthy upward swing, 10 years since the 2008 Wall Street crash. This has been attributed to the twin economic shocks – demonetisation and GST – and PM Modi will have a hard time explaining the counter-trend in India as opposed to the global upswing. This means at the World Economic Forum, which is hosting 2,500 delegates including several heads of states or elected premiers, along with 120 global CEOs, Modi and Trump would be doing the opposite jobs. While Modi will be looking for more FDI – it’s significant that 100 per cent   via automatic route has been sanctioned just before the WEF 2018 – and “hard-selling India” as a brilliant investment destination, Trump will be selling his America First policies to retain most of the CEOs who happen to be Americans, to pick the United States over emerging economies with huge markets such as India and China. With business heads, prime ministers and presidents of countries, academicians, philanthropists, environmentalists, Silicon Valley honchos, human rights activists and members from art and cinema all descending on Davos for the WEF, it’ll be the usual potpourri of intense debates around the biggest hot-button issues of our times.  These  narrow nationalisms (including the Trump variety, but also perhaps the Modi variety), climate change, cyber-security and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation in manufacturing that is posing a serious threat to low-end jobs, refugee crises such as plight of the Rohingyas, and the ongoing battles creating fresh flux of conflict migrants, ecological damage owing to urbanisation, depletion of forest covers for agriculture and industry, river and ocean water pollution, etc. On the sociopolitical side, the fallout of the Harvey Weinstein revelations and the #MeToo movement and the new feminist wave gripping the world, the demand for new equality, the women’s marches in the United States but also in other countries, the rights of LGBTQ peoples and their battles with law and social prejudice, especially in a country like India, sex education and reproductive rights for women, etc, would figure prominently in the debates. Released a week before the WEF commences, the   underlines all the major threats and the likelihood of their occurrence or intensification, that the global systems need to face together. These include extreme weather events, natural disasters, cyber attacks, data fraud/theft, failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation, climate/war-induced involuntary migration, terror attacks, illicit trade, asset bubbles in major economies, weapons of mass destruction and the nuclear arms race, biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse, spread of contagious diseases, water crises, food shortage, among others. In fact, Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum has clearly stated in the risk report that “unilateral nationalisms” pose a threat to the joint action needed to mitigate these enormous challenges, making a thinly veiled reference to Trump. While Europe is banking on French president Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to bring more collaborative projects together, the presence of post-Brexit United Kingdom prime minister Theresa May, is likely to add to the clamour. Last year, in the aftermath of Trump’s election to the White House, WEF found an unlikely foothold in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ode to globalisation, underlining the great irony of a communist country head batting for the global capital and free market of funds and ideas. While Xi hogged the limelight and China filled in the huge vacuum left by the US in matters of international leadership, this time,   by Xi’s economic adviser Liu He, amid concerns over One Belt One Road initiative’s possible . This leaves a big opportunity for PM Modi to pitch India’s as the global destination for investments. As part of his Make in India scheme, PM Modi is likely to use the hoopla surrounding his Davos visit to signal that India is greenlighting major global companies to invest in India. His business dinner with corporate heads on January 22 and his   on   at the opening plenary session are both being looked forward to by Indian and foreign observers alike.    Though Union finance minister   the WEF, PM will be accompanied by a retinue of ministers, including Piyush Goyal, Suresh Prabhu, Dharmendra Pradhan, MJ Akbar and Jitendra Singh at Davos, and Modi’s motto is going to be  .  In two recent interviews, a rare occurrence in themselves, PM Modi maintained that his stint at Davos would be about “sharing his vision for India’s future engagement with the international community”. PM Modi is likely to meet Swiss premier Alain Berset to discuss issues of financial transparency and black money. Being the face of the world’s seventh largest economy with an excellent growth rate that was stymied somewhat by the twin shocks of 2016 and 2017, PM Modi’s handling of the 2.3 trillion dollar economy has been keenly watched in the almost four years into his government’s tenure. While the Indian delegation of business leaders and members of the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry), including Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani, Azim Premji, Chanda Kochar, Uday Kotak, Ajay Singh, Rahul Bajaj, among others, will be signing or negotiating pacts with their foreign counterparts, superstar and king of Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan will receive the annual Crystal Award (along with Cate Blanchett and Elton John) for his work towards “improving the state of the world”. While Ramesh Abhishek, secretary, department of industrial policy and promotion, has confirmed that PM   with 60 top global CEOs, including 20 from India, on January 22 night, would be a big deal, literally, other informal interactions at the sidelines with representatives of General Motors, Sakesforce, Royal Dutch Shell, Nestle, JP Morgan, Airbus, Hitachi, BAE Systems, IBM, etc would be top calls on the part of the prime minister. The mix of soft power in the yoga classes, as well as the hard power through strong negotiations at the financial high table, would nevertheless be met with puzzling questions on India’s economic performance at home, as well as the case of Aadhaar which has now garnered  , despite fawning editorials earlier. This would naturally put a question mark of Modi’s other flagship scheme, Digital India, and would also sit well with the prognosis on data fraud and risk posed by digitisation encapsulated in the Global Risk Report 2018 by the WEF organisers themselves.",2018-01-22,"Foreign relations,Diplomacy,Climate change,Narendra Modi",World Economic Forum 2018: Anti-globalist Trump and FDI-hungry Modi stand for clashing trends in Davos,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/world-economic-forum-2018-davos-donald-trump-narendra-modi-climate-change-diplomacy-foreign-relations/story/1/21889.html
558,DailyBite,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a hit in front of crowds — with millions of people watching him, waiting for him to speak, looking up to his podium with the adoration one reserves for deities. Yet, for all his charisma, it is hard to get a one-on-one with the PM. It is a rare occasion when one gets to see Narendra Modi answer questions posed by an individual in a closed room. So it was an “Eid ka Chaand” moment when Zee News’ Sudhir Chaudhary got the PM to give him an  . Even when faced with softball questions, PM Modi managed to give a few biting replies that will help bolster his supporters' affection and raise many an eyebrow — especially among his critics and detractors. Responding to a question on democracy and criticism, the PM  : “Criticism should not be seen as bad and this is the strength of democracy where everything must be analysed. Good things should be praised and shortcomings should be criticised.” About the criticism of the BJP government’s economic and financial decisions — including GST, demonetisation and the GDP growth rate slowdown — Modi said it is healthy since the country’s focus has shifted towards economy and growth. He added, however, that the BJP government has faced “less criticism and more allegations” and that issues like corruption and black money have long been a topic of discussion. He also  , “Don’t evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST. We brought economic reform, built toilets, brought electricity to 18,000 villages. The success of GST lies in the power of the federal structure. It takes time to adjust to change, but the outcome will be good.” But it was not just criticism the PM spoke about. On being asked about his unique diplomatic style — as he has demonstrated with world leaders like former US president Barack Obama, current US president Donald Trump, Russia president Vladimir Putin and Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu — Modi said he is an ordinary person and that is what helps other leaders befriend him. “Every time I stand besides world leaders like Putin or Trump, all I remember is that I am the representative of 125 crore Indians. They have given me the mandate to be there. We must also remember world is an interconnected entity and we cannot live in isolation.” Continuing on his interactions with world leaders and India’s position in the world, Modi said: “India has been instrumental in bringing world’s attention to financial transparency. It was acknowledged by former United States president Barack Obama.” Modi further stated that the Word Economic Forum (WEF) in  , Switzerland — to be held on January 22 and 23 — will be a “good opportunity” for the country as it is a big market with the strength of demographic dividend: “Davos is a major platform in the financial world. Many business leaders gather there to deliberate upon the economic future of the world. India is the centre of attraction for the entire world. There are two reasons for that. First, our GDP is growing at a fast pace — and this has been accepted by leading agencies like the World Bank, Moody's etc; second, due to our strong democratic values. It's a unique combination of both in India. And that's what has evoked everyone's interest. So it's an opportunity for India to showcase itself on a global platform like WEF in Davos."" Speaking of the Opposition, the PM said that the UPA government “did not address the issues of states. The central government did not listen to us. We respect the federal structure. Hence, we were forced to take economic and monetary reforms”. GST is the product of such a reform, he added. “We have worked hard towards building the concept of one nation-one tax.” Modi also spoke of a number of development issues, especially pertaining to the financial. “The country has witnessed a growth of 70 lakh accounts of employee’s provident fund. The Mudra Scheme launched by the Centre has also been successful. The initiative of government e-market has empowered small-scale entrepreneurs across the country. It has not only helped in reducing government’s expenditure but also dismantled the monopoly of big entrepreneurs.” Several times during the interview, referring to the gigantic mandate that got him elected, Modi said, “My work is to be the voice of 125 crore citizens and I am trying to do that honestly.”",2018-01-19,"Sudhir Chaudhary,Zee News,Interview,Narendra Modi",'Don't judge me on demonetisation and GST': Modi talks tough on criticism in interview,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-interview-zee-news-gst-demonetisation-netanyahu-gdp-growth/story/1/21856.html
559,Pooja Shali,"The news of the impending disqualification of   for allegedly holding office of profit spread like wildfire in newsrooms today (January 19) afternoon. According to AAP leaders, the matter to be referred to the president of India is without a complete hearing of the ""office of profit"" case. With that, the expected political blame game ensued throughout the day. Soon after coming to power in 2015, the AAP government had passed an amendment to the Delhi Members of Legislative Assembly (Removal of Disqualification) Act, 1997 to ""exempt the post of parliamentary secretary from the definition of office of profit with retrospective effect"". The Kejriwal government later appointed 21 AAP legislators as parliamentary secretaries in order ""to assist ministers in speedy implementation of work"". The party even claimed that the 21 MLAs won't take any remuneration and so wouldn't fall under the office of profit regulations. It was the Congress, which on June 9, 2016 had moved the poll panel seeking disqualification of the 21 MLAs. Considering that one of them, Jarnail Singh, had resigned to contest the Punjab Assembly polls, the number stands at 20 now. The disqualification of the MLAs will pave way for by-elections in the Delhi Assembly. Sources claim 11 MLAs have been heard by the Election Commission and their statements recorded so far. The AAP, however, says these were not part of official hearing as the case was still in early stages of designating if EC, as a constitutional body, should hear the matter. Around 2pm today, reporters claimed their sources in the Election Commission (EC) hinted at a possible recommendation being sent to the president's office. It was also reported that the recommendation letter would agree that the MLAs received undue privileges as parliamentary secretaries, an additional position given to elected representatives (the appointments were against protocol). 
 
 There, however, was no official announcement by the EC in this regard, neither a confirmation nor a denial. And this is what has precisely got the AAP's goat. The party leaders attacked the Election Commission for acting ""as an agent of the BJP"" and ""leaking information to the media"". 
 
 The development signals considerable trouble for the AAP, which also heads the government in Delhi. AAP MLA Madan Lal rushed to the Delhi High Court in the hope of managing to get a stay order on the case. The court, instead, refused any interim relief and will hear the matter again on Monday at 4pm. The HC also reiterated to the party that the court has already deemed the positions unconstitutional last year and would not interfere further, asking the party to approach and respond to EC summons. 
 
 ""If approved by the president, 20 of the 66 MLAs will be disqualified, with immediate effect. With 46 in tow (BJP-3,  SAD-1), they would still retain majority in the 70-member Assembly.   Interestingly, two MLAs within the AAP are anyway considered ""opposition"" - the vocal critic Kapil Mishra and Pankaj Pushkar, a supporter of Yogendra Yadav. So, the number would unofficially stand at 44 , for the AAP.  Delhi will have to then brace for by-polls to 20 empty seats. The situation, however, is purely hypothetical right now considering neither the EC nor the president's office has confirmed the ""movement of the file"". Sources maintain that the notice has been received and is under consideration. As reporters rushed to the AAP office by 3pm, party leader Saurabh Bhardwaj launched a scathing attack against the EC, making a personal remark about CEC AK Joti's age and his approaching retirement. “AK Joti was the principal secretary under [the then Gujarat chief minister] Narendra Modi and then the chief secretary of Gujarat. He is retiring on Monday. So you want to repay Modiji’s debt. You are mortgaging a constitutional post like the Election Commission,” Bhardwaj said. But the matter is at sub-judice, a fact that the AAP spokespersons were quick to remind. Party leaders, meanwhile, started to reach Arvind Kejriwal's Civil Lines residence and went into a huddle. Each AAP insider, I spoke to, expressed deep anger against the Union government, before the line either got cut or went on hold. The party leaders were oscillating between ""breaking news"" correspondents and chalking out a survival strategy. Since its inception, the AAP has accused most existing institutions of being corrupt and anti-people - media houses, political parties and bureaucracy had been declared as bought-off by the rich and the powerful. The party eventually realised that, once in power, the perpetual derogatory tone is not the best way forward. Interestingly, the Election Commission's credibility had also been questioned occasionally by the party, but today the AAP came out all guns blazing. But it's debatable if their arguments were justified since rather than focussing on facts, party members primarily targetted the chief Election Commisioner over his alleged proximity to the BJP. But it seems the AAP is not alone. Many others are also raising questions over the EC's move. 
 
 Did the EC give any reasonable evidence in its defence against AAP's allegations that an independent organisation has compromised its credibility at the behest of a ruling party at the Centre? Well, an explanation by the EC will clear the air, before Arvind Kejriwal seizes the opportunity.",2018-01-19,"Election Commission,Delhi,AAP,Office of Profit",AAP MLAs disqualification: How the 'office of profit' case unfolded,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-20-mlas-office-of-profit-election-commission-ak-joti-bjp-bypolls/story/1/21854.html
560,Kiran Tare,"A fortnight after the riot at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on January 16 exhorted BJP workers to get into election mode in the next six months. That has led to speculation that the BJP might prepone Assembly election in Maharashtra by a year along with polls in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram. In his fourth year as the CM, Fadnavis' hopes to retain power are pinned on two ""achievements"" — his government’s social welfare schemes and the scattered opposition. While the first one has failed to convince the BJP cadre, the second situation might not last long, in the rapidly changing political scenario. Fadnavis has been insisting that BJP workers go out in public beating the drums on his government’s two goals, water conservation and debt-free farmers. The state’s flagship scheme, Jal Yukta Shivar, aimed at making 5,000 villages free of water scarcity every year, has delivered impressive results in some areas. The government has managed to deposit Rs 28,000 crore in the farmers’ bank accounts in an attempt to make them debt-free. However, neither the party workers nor its elected representatives are enthusiastic in advertising the government’s work. On the political front, the main opposition parties, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), are slowly but steadily working on their respective revival plans. The Congress has suddenly started feeling energetic after the Bombay High Court refused to prosecute its state president Ashok Chavan in the Adarsh society scam on technical grounds. Now, as he has no fear of action, Chavan is expected to come up with a broad strategy to corner the government. Confident that the government will not take any action against its two top leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare in the multi-crore irrigation scam, the NCP too has launched aggressive posturing against the government’s policies. A source told   that a fact-finding committee has not found any evidence of Tatkare’s involvement in the irrigation scam. On the contrary, the committee has pointed fingers at Pawar, whom the government does not want to touch due to several political compulsions. Caught in a tricky situation Fadnavis has only one option — boosting the morale of the BJP workers. He needs to pay attention to their grievances and demands and pat their back to make them feel they are also part of the government. His statement on poll preparedness is sparked by the sense of uneasiness he has noticed across the state. (Courtesy of  )",2018-01-19,"BJP.

561,Nivedita Khandekar,"Did you know that the mighty Himalayas provide livelihoods and ecosystem services to more than 210 million people — and provide water to more than 1.3 billion people, a fifth of the world’s population, living in downstream river basins? Now, imagine what happens when the snow on these high mountains melts at a faster rate in view of the rising global temperature? From Jammu and Kashmir in the west, to Arunachal Pradesh in the east, India is blessed with an almost 2,500km-long Himalayan range with varying biodiversity in sync with altitudes. This includes Ladakh and parts of Himachal Pradesh (Lahaul and Spiti) that fall in the trans-Himalayan region. This is all part of the Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) region spanning eight countries — Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet (under Chinese occupation), Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar — dependent on and facing similar problems due to the rising temperature in the HKH region. Ladakh has been witnessing increasing temperatures. Precipitation (snowfall in case of Ladakh) has been erratic to say the least. On the other hand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh have been witnessing similar developments with springs going dry early each passing year. Mountain communities are dependent on the local springs for their daily water needs rather than the massive rivers gushing through deep gorges or meandering through valleys. What people on the ground and experts have been saying has been corroborated in a report that will soon be released. The changing climate is indeed a serious issue when it comes to the Himalayas, the repository of snow/glaciers that feed billions in the subcontinent. As part of the Paris Agreement, more than 190 countries have committed to reducing their green house emissions and taking various measures to ensure that the global temperature does not go beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (as compared to the pre-industrial time). But, even when the world manages to maintain the global temperature rise average at 1.5 degrees Celsius, there will be a rise of 2 degrees Celsius or more in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region by the end of the century, resulting in a substantial decrease in snowfall and melt rates increasing by at least 33 per cent. This is already happening as temperature increases more rapidly in the high-altitude region, points out a report being coordinated by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development ( ), an inter-governmental organisation of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet (China), Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The soon-to-be published report ""Comprehensive Assessment of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) Region"", as part of the ""Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme ( )"" that is coordinated by the ICIMOD, points to a decrease in snow-covered areas and snow volumes over the coming decades in response to the increased temperatures and to the rise in the snowline elevation. The rising temperatures in the Ladakh region, made up of Leh and Kargil districts, should be a cause of immediate concern. Leh’s annual precipitation is about 100mm, all snow. Kargil receives more precipitation than Leh. For centuries, the region has received snow starting from October till March, vital for the survival of Ladakhi people and agriculture. Of this, snowfall in December, January and February is most important. But the scores of people whom I met last year and still others who I spoke with this year have been complaining about how snow has been missing for almost the whole of December in Leh town (about 11,000feet) and villages at a relatively lower altitude. A quick glimpse at the   (CRIS) of the Hydromet division of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for Leh shows that between 2012 and 2016, snowfall in November for four out of five years showed 100 per cent departure from long period averages for the district. For December, three out of five years show above 90 per cent departure from long period averages for the district. I called Sonam Lotus, who heads the IMD’s Jammu and Kashmir office, to understand what this data means. “Although just five years’ data is not sufficient to predict a trend, it is nevertheless true that snowfall in Ladakh has been variable and inconsistent. But one thing our records show is that there has been a significant increase in temperature (in Ladakh) especially after the 1980s,” he told me. Earlier, when there was snowfall, the snow would remain for almost a week or more. But now it melts in just two days, he observed, arguing that the increasing number of people (including the large number of tourists) and vehicles have pumped enthno-carbon and other green house gases into the atmosphere as Ladakh witnesses a drastic change, positive by conventional standards, in the standard of living. While talking about the future of the mountain communities and how their lives and livelihoods are integral to the well-being of the mountains, a common factor that comes forth across regions is the participation of the communities themselves. Unfortunately, government programmes largely neglect local communities. Be it the dams in the fragile Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh, be it factories set up along the rivers in the Himalayan foothills or the mounting problem of municipal solid waste, the government wants to keep away the community and bring in an outsourced partner. For decades now, the effects of such a debilitating approach are for all to see. It simply has not worked because community participation is the key to conservation, the key to ensure that local and global interests are taken care of. One of the best examples is the World Wide Fund: India’s Western Arunachal Landscape programme, which began in 2010, has been monitoring the presence of and working for the conservation of threatened species along with the local Monpa population of Tawang and West Kameng districts of Arunachal Pradesh. The community was faced with the crisis of springs drying faster — a continuous topic of discussion among the community and the WWF people. “Our conservation programme are primarily community conserved programmes, managed and owned by the local community. It is for their interest, to secure their livelihood and their ecological needs. For many years now, the community has been talking about the need for spring rejuvenation. We now plan to study and identify the springs in these two districts as a pilot project,” said Kamal Medhi, WWF-India coordinator, Western Arunachal Landscape. It is the tenacity of the communities that will help in the long run, with or without government help. But having committed to the United Nations via the Paris Agreement, governments of the HKH region countries are duty-bound to help their mountain communities. Going beyond the geo-political boundaries, these communities have had a healthy cultural exchange and a thriving trade. Even today, positive case studies from one mountain community can be tried by others and the government can facilitate such experiments. After all, for the government of India, as for other countries, there are very limited options when it comes to water availability. Surely, the Himalayas and their glaciers, the snow and the rivers that sustain such an enormous population are vital for our survival.",2018-01-18,"Himalayas,Climate change,Global warming",Rise in temperatures is threatening the survival of Himalayas,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/global-warming-climate-change-himalayas-ladakh-arunachal-extreme-weather/story/1/21812.html

According to the Union ministry of external affairs website, the   signed between India’s Vijay Gokhale, MEA’s secretary of economic relations, and Israel’s Yuval Rotem, “envisages cooperation in the field of cyber security to develop, promote and expand cooperation in the field of HRD through various platforms and arrangements such as training programmes, skill development, and simulator based hands-on training. It also envisages collaborating in the field of cyber security resilience, promoting B2B cooperation in cyber security and facilitating industrial summits”. While the MoU between the respective ministries of petroleum and natural gas/energy cooperation states that it’s about “looking to explore opportunities of long-term cooperative relationship and joint economic projects to enhance bilateral engagements in the field of Oil and Gas, inter-alia including collaboration in upstream sector activities; R&D and Technology; promoting institutional linkages between Universities and R&D establishment for mutually beneficial collaboration; and in the area of Start-ups”. Another related MoU has been signed between Invest India and Invest in Isarel – respective platforms – with the purpose of “supporting and developing cooperation between the two sides through exchange of information on investment opportunities, relevant laws and regulations, policies and government initiatives”. Keeping these three MoUs in mind, it’s important to look at another related news which claims that Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is set to  , a “big data and smart city tech provider”, which is an important business delegate of visiting PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s official retinue. Reported by a number of websites, the then imminent deal was about RIL’s “move to get deep into the smart city, big data, defence and critical infrastructure space”. As reported by  , this deal is about RIL getting “access to next-level technology on a number of mission-critical monitoring systems, big data analytics software for power utilities, industrial internet of things (IoT), smart cities, critical infrastructure and defence sector”.   quotes an official part of the B2B event, saying: “mPrest places a specific focus on the IoE (Internet of Energy) sector. Its power utility offering is a ‘System of Systems’ platform with applications including DERMS (distributed energy resource management), asset health management, mobile asset management, SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) enhancement and critical infrastructure protection security, and cyber management”. It’s important to read these two news items together to arrive at, if not a set of conclusions, certainly a set of pressing questions. Given the critical big data deal between Israel and India comes at a time when extremely sensitive matters of the very constitutionality of such mass-scale data scooping, collation and storage without the citizens’ informed consent, and/or any informed opinion on the technologically nebulous issues, are being heard in the top court of India, how are we to read this inter-governmental agreement, if not as an instance of technology-driven impatience of both governments and corporate behemoths? 
 
 As reported in  , apparently, the data-driven methods are being shared and accessed to “fight cybercrimes”, and the request for access to big data was from the Israeli side in the context of “how technology can now be used to agglomerate vast amounts of information and then bear on individual field and individual farmer’s efforts, improve the yield”. It’s interesting that in a country in which the majority of “individual farmers” are either landless or with very small landing holdings, with virtually no access to digital tech or data thereof, even as they are being forced to obtain the biometrics-based Aadhaar card and then link it to other nodes of information/identity proofs, the peg on which the “big data deal” has been hung is agricultural technology via data analytics. In fact, Union minister of agriculture Radhamohan Singh “participated” in the delegation-level talks on agriculture collaboration using India’s population big database. Moreover, to questions of “safeguards in place to share Aadhaar-based data with Israel”, there were no clear answers, other than stating basis aspects of an agriculture-centric programme. While the digital push to augment agriculture might be commendable in theory, there have been reported instances of   a very tangible, essential, non-digital ingredient necessary for agriculture – the waters of Narmada River. Even as the Sardar Sarovar Dam has been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with great fanfare, the   to “canals” and not farmlands, is becoming a huge bone of contention among the farmers of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Even Hardik Patel, the young Patidar leader who campaigned against BJP in Gujarat has tweeted his reaction to the agriculture-centric MoU between India and Israel based on the grievance on the ground. 
 
 Given that the priorities of the government aren't exactly in perfect order when it comes to agriculture, with massive debt, rainfall lapses, crop failures and other endemic issues haunting tens of thousands of farmers, exactly how will a deal involving sharing of big data between governments and corporate behemoths - integrating the diverse investments in energy and telecom, while spreading its wings in emerging fields of data analytics and critical-monitoring systems - actually help the farmer in whose name the MoU has been signed? Which brings us to the next question: what about data security and privacy? What is the exact nature of the data that will be shared, and what all safeguards are being put into place? How is it that another country, Israel, is given access to India’s centralised databases, whose existence is under the scanner, and whose legality is being debated in the Supreme Court of India, as we speak? There have been a number of reports   by foreign agencies – whether foreign government-driven or private and commercial, but big enough to  , and the Aadhaar database –  as has been repeatedly proven –  is a  . In this context, it is important to ask if the inter-governmental MoU between India and Israel is at odds with the fundamental   of the individual farmer at whose behest the big data is being collected, shared with another country? All this at a time when a giant corporate entity from India, with extensive interests in oil and natural gas, telecom, etc is looking to not just   diverse fields, but also control the mechanisms of monitoring via   of Indians. As internet and privacy rights activists have asked, what does it mean to have “ ”? One of the fundamental premises is we must safeguard people, citizens, individuals, over innovations in technology that erode privacy, individuality, autonomy – informational and bodily. Aadhaar-based authentication and databases have proven to be structurally invasive and exclusionary, which means any technology based on, or dependent on, such a loophole-ridden system is problematic to the very core, at odds with India’s billion-plus citizens, who should not be treated as mere sources of data and be . In fact, Biju Janata Dal MP Tathagata Satpathy has argued on exactly this line, saying a line of argument that treats   should compensate citizens for sharing their data, not otherwise. Instead, if citizens are being harnessed and farmed for data, as it were, by governments, technology giants and corporate behemoths alike, then we have created a system that’s extremely problematic, to say the least.",2018-01-18,"Modi government,Benjamin Netanyahu,India-Israel",India-Israel ‘big data’ deal leaves questions about security and privacy unanswered,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aadhaar-benjamin-netanyahu-modi-india-israel-big-data-deal-privacy-surveillance/story/1/21823.html
563,Aroon Purie,"I am not a very religious person, though I was born a Hindu. I do celebrate the festivals and follow most of the rituals. My father was a follower of the Arya Samaj and we had ""havans"" on all auspicious occasions, a tradition I continue to this day. I was born in Pakistan and growing up in newly independent India, differences of religion, caste or ethnicity were not something I was aware of. We were taught to respect everyone, regardless of their roots. Some may call me deracinated, and I have to confess I still do not know my ""gotra"", but I believe the greatest quality of Hinduism is its liberalism and its plurality. It is those qualities that are under threat today, as who we pray to and how we pray becomes politicised. Where there is religion, can politics be far behind? This unholy alliance is ruining the world. Our democracy has been weakened by vote bank politics. The most obvious manifestation of this is the culture of appeasement of minorities practised by the Congress party in the 49 years it ruled the country since Independence. The aggressive assertion of Hinduism, otherwise termed as Hindutva, that we are witnessing today is a backlash to this. As the BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe writing in this issue says, “it has spurred a mindless competition to get the tag of minorities”. This is not the way forward if we are to build an equitable society. The disadvantaged should be helped regardless of caste, creed or religion. It will happen only if we stop mixing politics with religion and prevent extremists from radicalising faith. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s new book,  , puts upfront a critical issue of our time - the difference between Hinduism and Hindutva. While Hinduism has a distinct cultural ethos with a common history, common literature and common civilisation, Hindutva believes Indian nationalism is the same as Hindu nationalism, and that non-Hindus must acknowledge their Hindu parentage or convert to Hinduism to return to their true cultural roots. Hindutva maintains that Hindus need to preserve and protect their religion and culture against the onslaught of a hostile, alien world. It is insecurity that drives this sentiment rather than strength, which is what Swami Vivekananda, who can only be described as the first rock star of Hinduism, believed in. I believe Hinduism teaches us to live amidst a variety of other identities, and to do anything differently would be, as Tharoor notes, a partition of the soul, after the partition of the soil. In the best traditions of the religion, we have invited reputed scholars, ideologues and politicians to debate the issue. There is former BJP general secretary, KN Govindacharya, who believes Hindutva means Hinduness and not Hindu nationalism in the Western sense; former West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi says the freedom of a Hindu to self-define his or her dharma is the greatest asset of Hinduism; novelist Kiran Nagarkar calls out the Sangh Parivar for obliterating the inherent inclusive values of Hinduism; while the bestselling author Devdutt Pattanaik exposes the myth of the wounded Hindu, tormented by a thousand years of slavery at the hands of the invaders. There is much more. Some of it is despondent, such as author and translator Arshia Sattar’s argument that the distinction between Hinduism as plural and Hindutva as singular is being lost at the hands of the newly empowered local gatekeepers of Hinduism and active proponents of a ""Hindu Rashtra"". For a multi-cultural country like India to be divided on the basis of religion is a recipe for disaster. But I remain hopeful. After all, which other religion in the world can say that it does not claim to be the only true one?

564,Shalini Chawla,"The  has for the first time claimed responsibility for the assassination of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on December 27, 2007. Pakistan Taliban’s claims are published in a  ,  , written by a senior Taliban leader Abu Mansoor Asim Mufti Noor Wali. The book was published on November 30, 2017, at Maseed Computer Centre at Barmal, in Afghanistan’s Paktika province. The 588-page book, posted online, contains TTP’s history, military operations, activities in Afghanistan, pictures of many Taliban leaders, and claims its involvement in a suicide bombing two months earlier at Bhutto’s procession in Karachi in October 2007, killing more than 140 people. The book claims that, “Despite attacks on Benazir Bhutto’s procession in Karachi, the government had not taken appropriate security measures that made it possible for the attackers to have easy access to Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi.” According to the book, Bhutto was killed since “her return was planned on the behest of the Americans as they had given her a plan against the ‘Mujahideen-e-Islam'. And slain Pakistan Taliban founder Baitullah Mehsud had received information of the plan”. For the first time, a terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the assassination which altered the political dynamics of Pakistan. Musharraf was accused of conspiring Bhutto’s assassination, murder trial remained controversial and Musharraf was declared fugitive. It is important to understand what compelled the TTP to make this announcement after 10 years. It would be useful to analyse some of the developments to be able to understand the unconventional move by the banned terrorist group. Pakistan's military launched a major offensive,  , in 2014 in North Waziristan and Khyber, following a major attack on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on June 8, 2014. The Operation was seen as a major success within Pakistan and the official records projected remarkable decrease in suicide attacks, terrorist attacks and fatalities in terrorist attacks. However, while the operation targeted a large number of TTP operatives, it did not manage to control the growth of extremism and terror within the country. There were major terror attacks in northwestern region conducted by Jaamat-ul-Ahrar (JA), a splinter group of TTP. The beginning of 2017 witnessed a series of terror attacks claimed by ISIS, challenging the success of the military’s counter-terror efforts. On February 22, 2017, Pakistan Army announced the launch of a nationwide military operation, Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad. According to an ISPR release, “the efforts entail conduct of broad spectrum security/counter terrorism operations by Rangers in Punjab, continuation of ongoing operations across the country and focus on more effectives border security management. Country wide de-weaponisation and explosive control are additional cardinals of the effort"".  The operation came as a response to a series of at least six back-to-back attacks in Pakistan within a week (mid-February 2017), killing more than 100 people in different parts of Pakistan. One of the deadliest attacks in the string of terror attacks took place on February 16, when a suicide bomber blew himself up among the devotees in the shrine of Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in the town of Sehwan in Sindh province. The attack was claimed by Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) and resulted in about 88 deaths and 300 injured. On the same day, in Awaran, an IED attack on a military convoy took place. is a continuation of the ""National Action Plan"" which was formulated after the 2014 attack in Peshawar on Army Public School. Expectations with Radd-ul-Fasaad have been high and army has claimed positive results from the ongoing operation, but the fact remains, that military’s ""selective approach"" in targeting terrorists will never allow the counter-terror efforts to succeed. Pakistan's military has been extremely proud of its counter-terror operations as these efforts have assisted the military to regain its waning credibility and prestige after  . Pakistan did draw out some applause from the US administration for its efforts in April 2017. The US-Pakistan relationship has been strained over the past six years and took an unyielding shift with the announcement of President Donald Trump’s Afghan policy which carried a firm message for Pakistan. Trump excoriated Pakistan for harboring criminals and terrorists. The US   revealed in December 2017 also carries an equally harsh message for Islamabad. Pakistan denied the charges and has reacted strongly to the US stance, claiming that Islamabad has lost 50,000 civilians and 6,000 security personnel in the war on terror and Washington cannot ignore these sacrifices. Although the US-Pakistan relationship is at the lowest in the past 16 years, the fact remains that both nations need each others’ support for various compelling reasons. While the US will require Pakistan’s support till it wants to continue its presence in Afghanistan, Pakistan is reliant on the US given its influence in international organisations. Washington is pressurising Pakistan to intensify its counter-terror efforts and Pakistan cannot afford not to take US concerns and stance into consideration. There have also been reports of ISIS establishing its base in Pakistan and spreading its tentacles. The  published by Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, alleges that ISIS is especially active in northern Sindh and Balochistan. Given these developments - Pakistan's military rejoicing over its victory over terrorists (mainly TTP as it is the deadliest anti-state organisation), US pressure on Pakistan to intensify its counter-terror efforts and the threat posed by the expansion of ISIS - one can infer what led to Pakistani Taliban’s revelation of Bhutto’s assassination. The revelation at this point of time serves three main purposes for the TTP: • It is a repeat signal to Pakistan's military that TTP would counter every move of US-Pakistan partnership in counter-terror operations. • In the past one year, terror attacks by ISIS have been on the rise which poses a threat to TTP’s status. The announcement also helps the organisation to reassert its presence. • Lastly and very importantly, it brings Pakistani Taliban in news and national and international limelight in an effort to maintain its positon and status in the competitive world of terrorism. While Pakistan's military claims that terror attacks are reducing in numbers, the TTP appears to be intact and determined in its resolve to oppose the state.",2018-01-16,"TTP,Musharraf,Pakistan,Benazir Bhutto",Why Pakistan Taliban is claiming it killed Benazir Bhutto,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/benazir-bhutto-assassination-pakistan-musharraf-tehreek-e-taliban-pakistan-baitullah-mehsud/story/1/21782.html
565,Ashok K Singh,"VHP leader  ’s allegations about ""conspiracy to kill him to weaken the Hindutva forces"" sound as startling as the Congress’s overtures to him appear to be confounding. But pause for a moment to think and you will see that it’s neither startling nor confounding. The Togadia episode fits in well with the current politics of the BJP as well as the Congress. The international working president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has been out in the cold for the past many years. He is of no use to BJP stalwarts Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in their home state. Togadia had no role to play in the Gujarat Assembly elections or its politics for a long time now. Modi has been winning the state elections on his own steam since 2001. In the early years, Togadia’s rabble-rousing, Muslim-baiting rhetoric helped mobilise VHP workers in Modi’s favour, but gradually Modi cut him to size.  Notwithstanding his nuisance value and hate speeches, Togadia, perhaps, was an asset for the BJP before and during the Vajpayee era. So were Ashok Singhal, assortment of sants and sadhus and many of Sangh Parivar motor mouths. But the Ayodhya issue gradually lost momentum after the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Although it prepared the ground for the first BJP-led government at the Centre, the party realised it was running out of agendas to keep the Hindutva pot boiling. Until Modi strode across the Gujarat landscape as he became chief minister in 2001. Soon 2002 riots happened and Modi burst onto the national scene. After the riots, Modi had no need for Togadia and his ilk in Gujarat. He emerged at the head of the hardline Hindutva, as its most potent mascot. He was capable of packaging VHP, Bajrang Dal, LK Advani and Vajpayee in one heady mix that became brand Modi. He could do everything that Togadia was capable of, and much more, but in a subtler manner. By Modi's second term as chief minister, Togadia and VHP became virtually irrelevant in Gujarat. The VHP and Bajrang Dal lost traction. In 2007 Assembly elections, Modi forced Togadia to stay out of Gujarat. In 2012 elections, a desperate Togadia tried to stage a comeback. He threw his lot with rebel BJP leader and former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, but results reaffirmed Modi’s invincibility. The people of Gujarat had bought into Modi's cocktail of development and Hindutva.  Despite Modi facing rough weather in the recent Assembly elections, Togadia remained a persona non grata for the BJP.  His mysterious disappearance for a day, hospitalisation and press conference alleging that he feared for his life in ""fake police encounter"" at the behest of the forces that wanted to weaken the Hindutva cause can be understood in the background of his strained relations with Modi. But the Congress seems to be placing values on even a weakened and irrelevant Togadia. In its desperate bid to reclaim lost power, the Congress under the president Rahul Gandhi is prepared to adopt all means, including supping with disgruntled Hindutva forces. Senior Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia met Togadia at the hospital in public glare. He said he met the VHP leader in his “personal capacity”, but expressed concern about ""dangers"" to Togadia’s life. Rahul Gandhi’s ally in Gujarat elections, Hardik Patel, too met him. 
 
 While they hit out at Modi and the Gujarat dispensation and demanded inquiry into Togadia’s allegations, it was ironical that they didn’t speak about the former doctor who has been a symbol of hate and bigoted politics. The BJP has asked the Congress to clarify its stand on whether the party supports the VHP leader. Hardik Patel posted a flurry of tweets before and after meeting Togadia. 
 
 The Congress’s hobnobbing with the VHP leader is part of Rahul Gandhi’s grand strategy to take the fight to the BJP camp. Emboldened by restricting the BJP to under-100 seats in Gujarat after his temple-hopping, declaring himself a Shiv-bhakht and janeudhari, Rahul Gandhi has made his intentions clear: a brick for a brick and an eye for an eye in the run up to the 2019 elections. Karnataka is bracing for a contest for Hindu votes between the Congress and the BJP. Later in the year, the contest is set to become even more ugly as the politics of grabbing majority votes gathers moment. One can understand Rahul Gandhi’s compulsion in wooing Hindus to regain votes the Congress has lost to the BJP. What’s difficult to stomach is that the Congress is willing to court someone like Togadia, perhaps the biggest hate monger the country has seen in the post-independence period. The central leadership of the Congress has not commented on Modhwadia’s meeting with Togadia, which speaks of its dilemma on taking a clear- cut stand. The Congress should have explained why Modhwadia met him and why didn’t he condemn Togadia’s politics while demanding investigations into the VHP leader’s allegations. The Congress’s occasional dalliance with the RSS has been known. Indira Gandhi’s temple visits and Rajiv Gandhi’s courting of soft-Hindutva for votes and its terrible consequences are also known. But never has the Congress dared to have truck with any bigot or Muslim baiter like Togadia or has even given the impression that it's ready to do politics with such elements. Or has the difference between “soft” and ""hardline"" Hindutva been completely blurred?  ",2018-01-17,"Narendra Modi,VHP,Pravin togadia,Congress",Newfound love for Pravin Togadia unmasks Congress' Hindutva agenda,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pravin-togadia-congress-rahul-gandhi-hardik-patel-vhp-modi-amit-shah/story/1/21788.html

""China will act as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and an upholder of the international order."" Will this translate in peace on the border in 2018? Probably not! Rumours are circulating that troops of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have intruded in Gelling sector in the Siang Valley of Arunachal Pradesh. China has not fully digested the fact that India stood up for Bhutan when the PLA was trying to build a road in June near the trijunction between Sikkim and Chumbi Valley in Tibet. Quoting ""experts"", a PLA website admitted that China will be better prepared ""next time"": ""the recent Doklam standoff had propelled China to perfect its strategy in its western part"" said chinamil.com.cn. Zhao Xiaozhuo, a research fellow at the Academy of Military Sciences is quoted by the same newspaper: ""India never takes road construction as an opportunity… and only thinks about its own interest."" Was the road on Bhutanese territory really an opportunity for India? It makes no sense. During a recent press conference, the spokesperson of the China's ministry of national defence said India ""should strictly control its troops"". While China is getting ready for another standoff, Beijing deeply dislikes Delhi developing its side of the border.  resented the recent visit of the Indian Union home minister  ; Singh spent the New Year with Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). ""An Indian road construction project connecting all border posts along the China-India frontier could lead to new military standoffs between China and India,"" warned another Chinese expert. China is unhappy because Rajnath Singh asserted that ""a number of border posts had already been connected with roads and many would soon be linked… this would enhance the operational efficiency of the officers and reduce mountain-related sickness among them."" While Beijing is going full steam to build infrastructure on its side of the McMahon Line, it complains about Delhi building roads on India's borders; amazing double standards. Nelong Border Outpost (BoP), located at the height of 11,700 feet, is manned by the ITBP. Accompanied by ITBP director general, RK Pachnanda, the minister later visited Pulam Sumda (14,200 feet) and interacted with jawans and officers. The area is disputed by the Chinese only because Beijing refuses to adhere to the universally-accepted principle of ""watershed"" used for demarcating borders. In Nelang, the watershed in the area is located at Tsangchok pass, beyond Pulam Sumda. At the same time, Beijing does whatever it wants on its side of the border.  recently reported: ""Investment in infrastructure in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) is helping to lift 628 villages along the border out of poverty."" The Chinese newspaper further asserted: ""After getting access to electricity and the construction of new roads, tea farmers and herdsmen in a village some 200 kilometres southwest of Lhasa in Tsona county founded a cooperative that provides skills training and job opportunities for villagers."" Lepo, a tiny village, north of Khenzimane, the last border post on the McMahon Line is said to have received several thousands of visitors last year and adequate lodging facilities have been provided to them. China further admitted: ""Starting last year, more than 100 million yuan (Rs 99.4 crore) has been invested in infrastructure in villages of less than 100 families as a part of a broader construction project to build model villages in the border area.""  estimated that by 2020, the road access rate in the area will reach 100 per cent and the per capita disposable income will double. Last week, Xinhua reported that China's least populated township had been connected to the national grid. It is Yume (also spelt Yulmed), the first hamlet north of Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh.Remember, at that time of the 19th Congress, Xi Jinping had written a letter to two young Tibetan herders who had introduced their village to the Chinese president. It was the same Yume.  commented: ""A sparsely populated township has been connected to the state electricity grid, ending life without electricity for its 32 residents."" The contractor, a Xining-based electric power company who worked on the project is quoted saying: ""The 15-kilometer 10-kilovolt power line, which took five months to complete, is connected via 108 electric poles over a 5,000-meter-high mountain."" There are many such examples along the Tibetan side of the McMahon Line. Year 2018 may not be serene despite the peaceful vows of President Xi.

567,Manoj Joshi,"On Saturday, Abdul Quddus Bizenjo of the Pakistan Muslim League (Q), the so-called kings' party of the Musharraf era, took over as chief minister of Balochistan along with a 14-member cabinet. He is the third chief minister in four and a half years. Bizenjo replaced Sanaullah Zehri of the PML (Nawaz), who was forced to resign from office ahead of a no-confidence motion against him. Not surprisingly, 11 of the 14 incoming cabinet members are members of the PML(N). Most observers see this manoeuvre as the Pakistan Army’s move to punish former PM Nawaz Sharif by depriving his party of any sustenance. If anything, this is a sign that parties and ideology don’t matter in official Baloch politics, but it is individuals who are easily open to manipulation. In fact, Bizenjo won the 2013 election with just 544 votes cast in his favour. The turnout in his constituency was just 1.18 per cent. In 2013, PML(N) won a majority of seats and formed a coalition government and selected a middle-class Baloch nationalist, Abdul Malik Baloch of the National Party as chief minister. But Malik had to make way for Zehri in 2015. Baloch nationalists opposed the elections and many boycotted the process. Even those who did participate, such as Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the leader of the Balochistan National Party, rejected the outcome, charging authorities with manipulating the results. Balochistan has suffered from prolonged political turmoil and successive phases of insurgency and violent religious extremism. The most recent bout of violence began in 2003 and is still continuing. In the period between 2011 and 2016, nearly 4,000 people were killed, including 1,000 classed as terrorists, who could be separatists or sectarian killers who target Shias in the Quetta area. In 2017, violence intensified with massive bombings in Quetta, and other areas targeting Shias, Sufis and security forces. At the end of the year, a bomb blast killed nine and injured 57 people when a Methodist Church was targeted by the Islamic State. The Pakistan Army has sought to use violent religious extremist groups to counter Baloch nationalism and blame India for the violence. There are of course nationalist groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army, Baloch Republican Army and Baloch Liberation Front. Pakistani authorities focus their ire on Brahamdagh Bugti of the BRA as the principal villain because he is openly pro-Indian and has even sought political asylum in India. But actually, most Baloch nationalists reject secession in favour of greater autonomy and the groups are hopelessly divided along tribal lines. Balochistan has now come into international focus because of a report that the Chinese may be establishing a naval base on the Jiwani peninsula, adjoining the port they built and operate in Gwadar. Not many are taken in by Beijing’s denial. As for Gwadar, it is the starting point of CPEC, which has become a flagship scheme of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan claims Chinese investments will generate jobs and prosperity for everyone, including the Baloch. The government believes that once the mega projects kick in, Baloch nationalism will lose steam. There is an element of wishful thinking in the Pakistani belief that CPEC will be an answer to all its problems and moderate Baloch nationalism. They believe the Baloch live in a feudal environment, dominated by their sardars and once the area is opened up, things will change. Pakistani authorities have shown little sophistication in addressing the challenge of violence in the province whose roots go back to the sensitive issue of Baloch identity. The Pakistani state, especially the Army, tends to see Baloch nationalism as a threat to Pakistan’s integrity. In recent years, Pakistan has sought to introduce the “Indian hand” as the cause of problems. They cited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s references in his Independence Day speech in 2016 and their capture of naval officer Kubhushan Jadhav to back their claims. However, Modi’s reference was innocuous to say the least and as for Jadhav, there is no real proof that he was involved in doing anything in Balochistan. Politics are not normal in Pakistan, and even less so Balochistan. Violence and political turbulence are, of course, there, but the real problem is that it is somehow not seen as being part of the Pakistani mainstream. By and large, its parties are electoral coalitions that rise and come apart depending on the exigencies of power. Sentiments are with Baloch nationalists, but authority is exercised by an elite which is backed by the Army.

568,MG Arun,"Since its launch under the UPA government in 2009, Aadhaar, the 12-digit unique identity number issued to Indian residents based on their biometric and demographic data, has grown to boast of 1.19 billion members as on November 30, 2017. It is the world’s largest biometric ID system, with experts calling it the most sophisticated ID programme in the world. Yet, recent events have proven that this mammoth exercise, which the present government has further pressed hard to make a standard requirement for availing the most commonplace of benefits and services, also faces the equally mammoth threat — data leakage.

The initial response of UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India), which implements Aadhaar, was one of the proverbial ""shooting the messenger"", but following the cacophony the issue raised, it stepped into some positive action. UIDAI restricted access of around 5,000 designated officials to the Aadhaar portal. It also allowed citizens to use a virtual ID that could be shared with all agencies, including the government, rather than the 12-digit Aadhaar ID, lending it more privacy. The next question that is being asked is, has the decision to provide a virtual ID made the Aadhaar more complicated for the masses? How many of the citizens will actually use the virtual ID? Wouldn’t there be a large section which is still vulnerable? While the concept of providing every Indian a unique ID was hailed by all, it was the manner of it being made compulsory to avail services — right from the distribution of subsidies, to paying income tax to purchasing mobile SIM cards and insurance or even procuring a death certificate — that made it controversial. Giving out the ID for such services so rampantly also exposed it to misuse by fraudsters. The issue has reached the apex court, which is hearing a slew of petitions relating to privacy issues around Aadhaar, including whether privacy is a fundamental right. On October 30, the Supreme Court referred all Aadhaar related cases to a five-judge Constitution bench. The Court, on December 15, extended the deadline to link Aadhaar with insurance policies, mutual funds holding and mobile phones to March 31 this year. The next hearing is scheduled on January 17. This is not the first time that issues of Aadhaar data breach have been raised. In July last year, there have been reports that customer data of a telecom firm, comprising sensitive details of millions of its users, including their Aadhaar numbers, was leaked online. Even then, there was a demand from experts that India needs to strengthen its privacy laws in line with the 2012 recommendations of the Justice AP Shah-led group of experts on privacy. In its report, the panel had said that a framework on the right to privacy in India must include privacy-related concerns around data protection on the internet, appropriate protection from unauthorised interception, audio and video surveillance, use of personal identifiers, bodily privacy including DNA as well as physical privacy. In the absence of strict privacy laws, intimate details of citizens can easily fall into the hands of fraudsters, which need to be avoided at all costs. Even the staunchest of opponents to Aadhaar feel that the government is unlikely to back away from continuing to insist on Aadhaar ID for most benefits and services unless the top court comes out with some severe strictures. Certain countries, however, have backtracked on such initiatives after discovering flaws in it. Reports say the UK scrapped its biometric identification plan in 2010 and destroyed the associated database. Meanwhile, the Social Security Number in the US is not biometric and is not used for basic services such as phones and credit cards that can lead to mass surveillance and breach of privacy. Moreover, countries like Germany do not impose biometric identification to deliver public services. It can be argued that the situation in India is different, given the rampant leakages in the subsidy system, which calls for a more foolproof identification system.

569,Shantanu Mukharji,"For former president Pranab Mukherjee, life after presidency seems equally exciting, if not busy. Be it the launch of his political memoir (third book in the series) in October last year or his bold address at the Aligarh Muslim University on founder Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s 200th birthday, Mukherjee chooses his words and events carefully. The former president is all set to visit Bangladesh on January 14 on a three-day trip. Needless to emphasise, he enjoys enormous goodwill in the neighbouring country. Held in very high esteem from the days of Bangladesh’s struggle for liberation, his fan following , cutting across party lines, is simply huge. Incidentally, the native place of Mukherjee's parents-in-law is on the other side of the border, and he obviously has several close relatives living there. That apart, Pranab babu has earned this goodwill by sheer hard work and undivided attention to the well-being of Bangladesh in redressing issues pertaining to Indo-Bangladesh relations. His contribution can be called phenomenal in major contentious issues concerning India and Bangladesh. The veteran Congress leader held several ministerial portfolios in the government of India - external affairs, finance, defence etc. That notwithstanding, he never took his eyes off the happenings in Bangladesh and always used his good offices, in all seriousness, and on all occasions requiring effective intervention. Right from Bangladesh's independence war in 1971, Pranab babu has always been proactive and lending help whenever required - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's return from imprisonment, his installation as the prime minister, the tragic assassination and the trail of sensational developments impinging on India’s geo-political landscape due to rise in power of pro-Pakistani, Right reactionary forces who usurped power by facilitating a military coup and exterminating Mujib. It’s is believed Mukherjee proved to be a sheet anchor to the bereaved family of Sheikh Mujib at the time of grief and stood as a great pillar of strength to them. He was also the bridge between the family members and former Indian PM Indira Gandhi, comprehending and reacting to the events unfolding in Dhaka . The bloody coup was followed by counter-coups that took a huge toll and pushed Bangladesh into a turbulent time. Successive regimes, imposition of martial law, general Hussain Mohammad Ershad's rise and Ziaur Rahman's assassination were hallmarks of Bangladesh contemporary history in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The man who held the hand of the distressed nation and at the same time took into account India’s security interests, is none other than Mukherjee. Although Sheikh Hasina (in her earlier stint) eventually came to power and was voted out after five years, Pranab Mukherjee maintained good relations with all and helped solve age-old problems of water-sharing and the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs ) accord that facilitated the return thousands of Chakma refugees to Bangladesh. In brief, whenever Bangladesh ran into rough weather, Mukherjee steadied the ship and things remained on course keeping Indo-Bangla relations intact. Interestingly, opposition leaders in Bangladesh too have immense respect for Mukherjee and acknowledge his vision and hold over the nuances of Bangladeshi politics. Mukherjee will be in Bangladesh to attend a number of programmes, including the closing session of the ""International Bengali Literature Conference"". According to   news report, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""will inaugurate the three-day literature conference on Saturday (January 13) at Bangla Academy, while Mukherjee will be present at the closing ceremony of the conference on Monday (January 15), as the chief guest"". He will also be flown in to Chittagong on January 15 to be honoured with a D Litt degree by the Chittagong University. In Chittagong , Mukherjee is also expected to be accorded a civic reception. On his part, Mukherjee will present a cheque on behalf of the Indian high commissioner to the Preetilata Trust in furtherance of its activities . Significantly , Mukherjee will also visit the memorial of Surya Sen aka Masterda, the famous revolutionary, known for the Chittagong armoury case. In Dhaka, he is scheduled to deliver the convocation address at the East West University and the Nikhil Bongo Sahitya Sammelan. So far, no meetings have been fixed with any political leaders. It’s assessed that abundant caution is being exercised so as to keep Mukherjee away from any political event, lest it is wrongly interpreted since the general elections in Bangladesh are due at the end of 2018 or early next year. On the whole, the visit is likely to go a long way in reinforcing ties between India and Bangladesh ensuring that at least there is one immediate neighbour who can be relied upon and vice-versa. His presence on the Bangladeshi soil will also encourage secular and pro-liberation forces to rally around Sheikh Hasina, which in effect, will help neutralise communal and divisive forces.  ",2018-01-13,"Sheikh Hasina,India-Bangladesh ties,Bangladesh,Pranab Mukherjee",Why Dhaka is gearing up to greet Pranab Mukherjee,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pranab-mukherjee-bangladesh-visit-india-bangladesh-ties-sheikh-hasina/story/1/21725.html
570,Nooreen Sarna,"When four of the   of the Supreme Court decide to hold a press conference to discuss internal disagreements, as they did on the morning of January 12, one   it was not an easy decision to make. One   that it was made under advisement and not carelessly or hurriedly. And one wonders how a schism of this magnitude can heal itself, without the independence of the institution being compromised, and in the absence of any rules or conventions to address factionalism in a collegium. The need for transparency in the functioning of the higher judiciary cannot be emphasised enough. The institution, while entirely unelected, wields a disproportionate amount of power. Constitutional amendments carrying the approval of Parliament and a majority of the state legislatures can turn to dust in the Supreme Court. Additionally, its members are (almost) uniquely difficult to remove from their posts; the process of impeachment being complicated, time-consuming and highly political. The   held at justice J Chelameswar’s house brought to the fore certain questions about the judiciary’s relationship with transparency in its functioning. First, why are there no internal safeguards to deal with administrative issues in the functioning of the Supreme Court? The fact that discussions among the five senior-most judges repeatedly failed, and that a press conference was held out of frustration rather than convention, highlights a lack of structure in the administrative functioning of the Supreme Court. It seems as though there are no intermediate steps to settle administrative or even disciplinary issues in our multi-tiered judiciary. In the higher judiciary, transfers on disciplinary grounds are not common and, naturally, at the Supreme Court, this is not an option. The remote threat of impeachment is the only way to correct or direct judicial conduct. However, impeaching proceedings cannot be instituted by other judges of the Supreme Court and can hardly be termed as remedial in nature.   For an institution considered to be self-governing and supreme, we find that, in situations of internal conflict, there is no structure for internal solutions, and recourse to the media and, possibly, political bodies becomes inevitable. Second, how do we trust that other decisions of this collegium have been made on objective grounds? The Supreme Court has 25 judges currently. Two appointments have already been made by this very collegium,  this past week, and more appointments may well follow here and for the High Courts. In the absence of a truly transparent appointment process, we cannot be certain that voting will not take place according to other prejudices and that the voting pattern won’t reflect other divisions. This is not to question the integrity of the four judges at the press conference (who constitute a majority of the collegium), but rather to say that dangerous conclusions are left to be drawn in the absence of public information available about the functioning of the collegium. And third, will we only see transparency in times of dissent? Is the judiciary picking and choosing when to be transparent? There must be transparency in administrative functioning of the Supreme Court, including in issues of allocation of matters to certain benches. This transparency should not be brought in only when there is a disagreement among the judges - it makes it akin to a kind of whistle-blowing, wholly dependent on the conscience and state of mind of the whistle-blower. This is not to say that there was no good reason to address the public about the deadlock in administrative functioning in the Supreme Court. For a body like the judiciary and the role it plays in our democracy, a show of transparency cannot and should not be sporadic. It should not open itself up to allegations of being motivated. Any efforts made at introducing transparency should be capable of serving as lasting precedents.",2018-01-12,"National Medical Council row,Dipak Misra,CJI,Supreme Court",Supreme Court judges' revolt: Hard-hitting questions for Indian judiciary,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-cji-dipak-misra-transparency-dissent/story/1/21713.html
571,Anusha Soni,"A lot needs to be said about the historic day when four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court on January 12  of democracy - the media - to convey that the third pillar - the judiciary - is currently facing immense threat. The only time India faced such a crisis was during the Emergency. As the legal reporter for India Today TV, I have been asked by many people about what led to the day's events. How did things come to a head? And where will this lead to in the coming times? I will try and answer them in this piece: It's true that in the past few months, the judicial corridors have been abuzz about how power is increasingly being concentrated with the CJI court and the manner in which the administrative powers are exercised by the CJI. About hundred cases are listed before the CJI on any given day. Many judges have spoken about this in hushed tones, on how it is improper for the CJI to overturn the orders of the other benches because there is no intra court appeal in the Supreme Court. As someone who spends every day at the Supreme Court to report stories, I will admit, I have felt inhibited bringing to light some of these issues which need to be discussed in the open. The order of two-judge bench cannot be overturned by a three-judge bench unless the two-judge bench has referred the matter to a larger bench. These are some of the grievances which have been criticised. The issue of impropriety, however, is more serious: It is repeatedly pointed in the seven-page letter circulated by the judges on Friday that the way the CJI exercises his ""administrative powers"" is arbitrary. This phrase needs to be broken down and looked at. Administrative powers in the Supreme Court means how cases are allocated to benches. It's extremely crucial that the matters are allocated according to the roster and not haphazardly. The allegation made implies that the CJI is not following the rules and is allocating matters to a particular bench to get a predictable outcome. A crucial unsaid truth about the judiciary is that journalists and lawyers can always get a sense of the mood and inclination of judges. Political leanings of judges, if any, are also widely spoken of, off the record. These things can't be said on public fora. A social closeness to a political person does not necessarily mean that the judge is not being objective while handling a case. But it is very important for the fate of the case as to in front of which bench it is listed. It is a crucial aspect in the process of deliverance of justice. It is not merely administrative in nature. What led to the happenings of January 12 go back to events of November 10, 2017 when the seeds of the dissent were sown. It was the day when the CJI  of Justice Chelameswar to refer the MCI scam to the bench of top five judges. An ugly scene broke out in the Supreme Court, with Prashant Bhushan openly alleging that the CJI was involved in corruption. An angry Bhushan walked out of the court when he wasn't allowed to speak. An order was passed by the CJI bench reasserting that the Chief Justice of India is the master of the roster. Even to this day, sources say, justice Lokur and other judges of the Supreme Court met justice Chelameswar. Some statement was expected on that day too, however, the steam seemed to have fizzled out. A few days later, the plea was referred to the bench of justice Arun Mishra. He was given this matter despite the fact that he was part of the five-judge bench which overturned the order of justice Chelameswar. Justice Misra was   about the conduct of Prashant Bhushan. Some argued that the matter should have been referred to another bench in the spirit of fairness. As expected, justice Arun Mishra dismissed the plea of Prashant Bhushan and severely criticised his conduct. In a related petition, Rs 25 lakh was also imposed on Bhushan. The matter was settled then, but a hurricane began to brew. Then came the plea seeking investigation into the allegedly mysterious death of judge BH Loya, who was presiding over the CBI court in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case. The matter was again referred to the bench of justice Arun Mishra. One of the petitioners in the Loya case came to me and informed that a senior lawyer backed out from the case by saying nothing was going to happen in the matter. It was during this conversation at 11.10am that a source informed me of the press conference. Interestingly, while the press conference was taking place, the CJI court around 12 noon was informed of the developments. A whistle was sounded in the CJI court and the guards rushed in to escort the CJI out of the courtroom. The timing of this entire incident cannot be overlooked. The press conference took place during the working hours of the Supreme Court and the CJI had no clue about this development. The top four judges of the Supreme Court rose up at around 11am and headed to the residence of Justice Chelameswar. Many legal experts today sound surprised with the developments of the day. They seem to have missed the frustration and the discontent brewing in the power corridors of the judiciary. The push and pull of the collegium is not something new. But when top four judges of the Supreme Court see no recourse but to address the media, we are indeed in for troubled times. The disenchantment with the way top court is functioning is deep and pervasive. The underlying current is the interference of the executive with the judiciary. When top judges of the Supreme Court say that democracy is under threat, we must take it seriously. When media shy judges are compelled to address a mob of press and speak openly, imagine the discontent and the helplessness festering within. The day shall go down in history when a clarion call was made for change and accountability. How it impacts the CJI and Parliament, the people of the country have a right to know and want an accountable judiciary.",2018-01-13,"National Medical Council row,CJI,Supreme Court,Dipak Misra",Why rebellion at Supreme Court was in the offing,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-cji-dipak-misra-transparency-dissent-justice-loya-mci-scam/story/1/21716.html
572,Shantanu Mukharji,"With the advent of the new year, a group of office-bearers believed to be representing more than a dozen gurdwaras in the Canadian province of  , have jointly decided to ban officials representing India, its diplomats and others from entering the premises of the Sikh temples. The decision was taken at Gurdwara Jot Parkash Sahib in Brampton on December 30. Significantly, the pro forma statement mentioned “pursuant to the trespass to the Property Act (1990), the management of the Gurdwara Sahib reserves the right to ban entry to officials of the Indian government including but not limited to Indian elected officials , Indian consular officials and members of organisations who seek to undermine the Sikh nation and Sikh institution ( )"". The statement further stated: “Keeping in mind the interference of Indian consular and Indian government officials in the lives of Canadian Sikhs, gurdwara management committees have jointly taken the decision to bar the entry of these officials and members from gurdwaras across Canada. The presence of these officials makes members of the Sikh community uncomfortable due to their agenda of undermining the autonomy of Sikh institutions and organisations. It is our obligation to ensure the safety of the 'Sangat'."" However, the statement clarified that the ban will be only on those visiting gurdwaras in their official capacity, not if they come in personal capacity. Meanwhile, pro-separatist activists, including Sukhminder Singh Hansra, have welcomed the decision alleging that officials were directly infiltrating into the Sikh affairs in Canada. This development is very  and, unless remedial measures are not taken without further delay, may give boost to the Khalistani movement, already brewing in the West. Examining the statements issued by the Sikh entities, it's difficult to miss the disturbing trend. When they say that the presence of Indian government officials tend to undermine the autonomy of the Sikhs and make them uncomfortable, it’s difficult to assess as to which factors are responsible to make the Indian officials’ presence uncomfortable. This appears to give a clear signal to the government to keep off the Sikh affairs which are interpreted to be the exclusive privilege of the Sikh clerical organisations. Gurdwaras have been rendering great service not only to the Sikhs, but to the world at large and the Indian community in particular in foreign countries. So what went wrong? Is it a growing distance between Indian diplomatic missions and Sikh shrines? This gap must be bridged sooner than later. It’s possible that a certain segment of the alienated Sikhs are discontented as their names continue to figure in the ""blacklist"" of the consular wing for their alleged acts in Punjab thought to be anti-national. If such suspicions are true, it’s time to revisit the names afresh. In today’s world of global uncertainties, no group can be insulated from the national mainstream. A healing touch is perhaps called for. Any tough measure is likely to be met with equally tough reaction which may be counterproductive. Coincidentally, barely 14 days after the Canadian notifications, the Sikh Coordination Committee East Coast (SCCEC) and America Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (APGC) stated that 96 gurdwaras have decided to ban entry of Indian officials. The ban would also hold good to Nagar Kirtans or religious processions. American Sikh entities following suit to the Canadian decisions, make the situation a little more complex. And if such bans catch on to other parts of the world, then a major fire fighting exercise seems called for before it gets out of hand. This also calls for caution as the SCCEC and the AGPC combine is the largest umbrella organisation of the Sikhs in the US. It is further known that the decision has been reached with the support of US-based Sikh group, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). In order to enforce their diktat, the Sikh bodies have also threatened to initiate legal proceedings against those Indian diplomats trying to breach the ban. On its part, any state, or in this case the government of India, cannot remain oblivious to the designs of the separatists to go on a propaganda offensive espousing their so-called cause. It has to come down heavily on the elements, now on a collision course, supporting the Khalistan movement. Having said this, it’s equally important to assuage the genuine grievances, if any, of those Sikhs who are provoked to resort to such a drastic course of action. It seems all Sikhs in Canada and in the US do not support the latest move to ban the entry of the Indian officials. If not for the active cooperation from the gurdwaras, it wouldn’t have been possible for the government of India to contain the Khalistani movement, at its peak in the 1990s. Both the gurdwaras and the high commissions/embassies had excellent relationships, churning out best possible results for the Sikhs and the Indian government representatives. The late Naresh Chandra, former US ambassador, appropriated best of collaboration with the gurdwara forces bringing in much-needed peace. There are multiple names in this regard who accomplished the task with dexterity and patience. Both the Canadian and US statements have a thrust in banning the consular officers. Probably that’s where it hurts most because it extends services to passport and visa services. If they are attended to on a case-to-case and genuine basis, more than half the problem is solved. Consular staff, therefore, perhaps needs to be more caring, sensitive and patient to assuage the disgruntlement. Presently, the Indian ambassador to the US, Navtej Sarna, is a Sikh and a seasoned diplomat. His officers manning the different consulates also carry huge experience and acumen. Similarly, India's high commissioner to Canada, Vikas Swarup, is most articulate and experienced in public and media dealings. They can walk the extra mile to prevail upon the Sikh bodies to rescind their orders in the larger interest of the country’s peace and sovereignty. Equally important is to pre-empt any probable evil design by the Pakistani forces, especially the ISI, unleashed to encourage the Khalistani forces. Frustrated by its self-aborted designs of Khalistani propaganda for the last so many years, Pakistani agencies may be attempting to stir yet another move to pinprick our security interests. Such a move must be averted for good, as time is running out.",2018-01-12,"India,Khalistani movement,US,Canada",Why gurdwaras in Canada and US banned the entry of Indian officials,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sikh-gurdwaras-canada-ontario-ban-indian-officials-khalistani-movement-pakistan/story/1/21705.html
573,Mohammad Behzad Fatmi,"Under the ongoing state of emergency, Turkey has issued yet another controversial   on December 24, 2017, granting immunity to civilians who were part of the mobs which suppressed the 2016 failed coup attempt against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. Authorities say such a measure was necessary to protect those civilians who risked their lives to shield their elected government - on the night of July 15 and the early hours of July 16, 2016 - from putschists. But the decree is so vaguely worded that it is possible for one to interpret it as granting immunity from prosecution for actions that one may have taken post-July 15 or may take in the future against a government critic on the pretext of suppressing the continuation of events on the night of the coup.  Regardless of its gravity and profound detrimental effect on the rule of law in the country, such a step by the AKP government hardly took anyone by surprise. Over the past couple of years, there have been multiple   of the AKP government establishing private militias loyal to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. One of the such prominent groups is   which allegedly had dozens of its men armed with semi-automatic rifles on the streets of Ankara and Istanbul, assaulting and killing many of the renegade soldiers on the night of July 15, 2016. Interestingly, SADAT also stands accused of killing a number of innocent civilians on that fateful night in order to boost public anger and help the government create a victim narrative. The newly issued decree practically means that not only SADAT and a number of other shadowy outfits like it will not be punished for these crimes, but they will also not be brought to justice should they take law in their own hands in the future, in circumstances they argue were similar to that of July 15, 2016. This move has led many to believe that the government is preparing for an imminent clash between President Erdogan’s Islamist and Dogu Perincek’s ultranationalist camp who despite being contemptuous of each other formed an alliance in the aftermath of the coup attempt to purge state institutions of pro-western officials. Dogu Perincek was jailed in 2008 during the Ergenekon trials for plotting to overthrow the AKP government, but his conviction was   in 2014 when Erdogan started to target the Movement of Islamic scholar Fethullah Gulen. On stepping out of the prison complex he talked to the media waiting for him and   that he will dismantle the “regime of Tayyip Erdogans, Abdullah Guls, Fethullah Gulens”, referring to the perceived alliance between the AKP and the US-based cleric. Since then Perincek has been back in business growing the influence of his tiny far-left Patriotic Party on important state institutions, especially on the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK). The “Perincek group”, as the ultranationalist pro-Russian companions of Dogu Perincek are often referred to in the Turkish policy chattering circle, has been the biggest   of the massive purge of pro-Western officials from the TSK following the coup attempt in 2016. The meteoric growth in influence of an ultranationalist group which has always despised the Islamist-rooted AKP poses an existential threat to the Erdogan regime - and Erdogan knows it very well. On the other hand, many analysts see this move as Erdogan’s preparation for another “false flag operation” which will justify crackdown on the remaining few voices of dissent in the country - the way the July 15 events justified suppression of the Gulen Movement. Even though there is no effective opposition in the country, there are still pockets of resistance and/or potential rivals which Erdogan would like to neutralise. The likes of former president Abdullah Gul, a few defiant MPs from the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), and of course the Perincek group are certainly not the type of forces Erdogan wants to accommodate in his vision of a totalitarian regime in Turkey. Regardless of whether Erdogan had the former or the later motive in his mind while drafting this decree, the situation that it may lead to cannot be peace and order - which Turkey needs desperately. It will certainly push the country towards chaos and instability, perhaps even towards a civil war.  ",2018-01-11,"Civil War,Racep Tayyip Erdogan,Coup Attempt,Turkey",Is Turkey heading towards a civil war?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/turkey-controversial-decree-coup-attempt-racep-tayyip-erdogan-civil-war/story/1/21677.html
574,Majid Hyderi,"There is still hope, but only for some. In the past six months, two verdicts from the apex court on two separate pleas seeking fresh probe - into the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and the killings of Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir in the 1990s and early 2000s - have drawn massive comparisons. On January 10, the   decided to set up a fresh special investigation team (SIT) to look into the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases in 1984, investigations into which were closed earlier. The apex court has also asked the Centre to suggest names for the proposed three-member panel, which will be headed by a former high court judge. The 1984 riots, which broke out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had claimed the lives of an estimated 8,000 people in Delhi and around the country. But then, if riots dating back to 1980s can be reinvestigated through an SIT, why is it declared “too late” for fresh investigations into the killings of Kashmiri Pandits in the 1990s? In July 2017, the apex court rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking fresh probe into the killing of Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir. Dismissing the PIL filed by an NGO “Roots in Kashmir”, the apex court said it would be difficult to probe as evidence “is unlikely to be available”. ""Almost 27 years have gone by… Where will the evidence will come from? Such a plea should have been moved long time ago,"" the   had observed. The petitioners had moved the court saying that they need a ""sense of justice"" in the case. ""The community has legitimate expectations. The successive governments have repeatedly made fake promises that the Pandits could return (to homeland). No one is protecting them,"" they prayed. The dismissal of the case buried all hopes for justice for the survivors of the systematic bloodbath. Apart from the outraged Pandit community, even a human rights group - largely run by Kashmiri Muslims - had sharply reacted to the court decision. The Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society in a statement had  : ""The Supreme Court order is a complete departure from established law that ‘crime never dies’, and there exists no time limitation for justice under Indian and international law with regard to serious crimes such as murder."" The rights group observed that “killings of Kashmiri Pandits, other minorities and all violence in Jammu and Kashmir have never been fairly and credibly investigated”, adding, “Thus far, Jammu and Kashmir has faced widespread, systemic violence, largely at the hands of the Indian state.” Three decades on, the killings of Pandits, continue to be an unsolved mystery. For the all-resourceful government, it took around two decades to just consolidate contradictory figures of the killings. As per a first comprehensive report compiled by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in 2008, from 1989 onwards, 209 Kashmiri Pandits were killed. As many as 109 killed in 1990 alone. According to this   in , while 140 cases were registered at police stations across Kashmir, chargesheets had been filed in only 24 cases. In 115 cases, the perpetrators are yet to be identified. Even the first reported killing of a Kashmiri Pandit remains unsolved. According to the police, the first Pandit to be killed was a woman named Prabhavati from Budgam. She was killed in Srinagar on March 14, 1989, by unidentified gunmen, whose identity could never be established. Of all the districts of Kashmir province, the summer capital of Srinagar, as per the police records, had witnessed the largest number of killings  - 82 - within two years of the onset of the armed insurgency. Apart from individual target killings, in some instances, the minority community people were massacred. These include the Sangrampora massacre in which seven persons were killed during on the night of March 21-22 in 1997 in Budgam, 23 were killed in Wandhama on January 25, 1998 and 24  murdered in Nadimarg on March 24, 2003. According to the police, the perpetrators of the Wandhama massacre remain untraced. There are slight contradictions even in the official figures pertaining to the killings. In March 2010, the then government told the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly that 219 Kashmiri Pandits had been killed by militants since 1989, , and not 209,  as previously reported by the police. But a year later in 2011, the Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a Srinagar-based organisation, said at least 399 Pandits had been killed. There cannot be a bigger pain than the exodus of the bereaved community out of their homeland. And this wound has been festering in the absence of a fair probe, something which could clear the air and lead to the severest punishment for the perpetrators. It could equally contribute in reconciliatory efforts aimed at harmonious return of the Pandits to their homeland. If investigations into the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases were closed without investigation, probe into killings of Pandits never took off.

But when it comes to elections, we show them the ballot finger. Since the ‘50s, film stars in India have, without hesitation, hopped on to the next, logical platform: politics. According to a   entry, India has three times the number of actor-politicians than most countries, followed only by USA and Philippines (I wonder what’s happening there!). Election results for actors have been far from blockbusting. Indian film stars have realised the bitter truth that winning votes is a lot tougher than bashing up villains. In fact, Sunil Dutt might be the only major film star who had a long, successful political career — winning five terms and also serving as Union minister for youth affairs and sports in the UPA government. Govinda did nothing of remote importance as a politician; the highlight of his political career being the moment when he begged Sonia Gandhi to become the prime minister — much like the climax of a certain David Dhawan-Kader Khan film. Hema Malini’s political career has been as spectacular as her daughter Esha Deol’s film career — with reports of villagers protesting outside her office since they saw zero development under the Dream Girl’s leadership. Hemaji is now seen as a representative for Kent RO. Actress Jayaprada’s career started with the Telugu Desam Party in undivided Andhra Pradesh; she then switched to Samajwadi Party in UP, and finally launched her own party. Chiranjeevi, the Telugu megastar, too, started his own party in 2008. In 2011, in a move that would give Chanakya a stroke, he merged it with the Congress. And then there’s the murky history  Amitabh Bachchan and late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in the Bofors scam. It is not only film actors who have dipped their fingers in the hot oil of politics. TV actors, too, have tried their luck. Smriti Irani is a success story, but other TV actors have found less success. Actors who essayed the roles of Ram, Krishna, Draupadi and Ravan (!) in mythological shows have contested elections in India. Shekhar Suman joined the Congress, lost an election, and returned to TV. Rakhi Sawant launched her own party targeted at the ordinary citizen, called Rashtriya Aam Party. So absurd is the association of stars with politics that Salman Khan has campaigned for both BJP and Congress. Bhai has gone so far as to campaign for the Sri Lankan president. Why?  Many actors such as Amitabh Bachhan and Govinda have gracefully resigned from politics, whereas the other have faced defeat, or been invited as Members of Parliament in Rajya Sabha. Barring Kerala, every Indian state has had actors chancing their luck in politics. Overall, the success rate of film stars in politics has been — to put it accurately — like Fardeen Khan’s career. However, this is only true in the northern parts of India. Down South, film stars have had blockbuster careers as politicians. People from north India are often baffled at the sycophancy surrounding film stars in Tamil Nadu, and attribute it to emotional overtures. It could be driven by emotion – like the temples built for actresses Khushboo and Namitha suggest. But politics is deeply intertwined with cinema in Tamil Nadu. The three largest political icons in Tamil Nadu are film stars — MG Ramachandran (actor), Karunanidhi (screenwriter) and Jayalalitha (actor). In undivided Andhra Pradesh, then megastar NT Rama Rao founded the Telugu Desam Party and became the chief minister of the state. In December 2017, Rajinikanth announced that he will contest the next Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. In many ways, Tamil Nadu politics is starkly different from politics in any other part of the country. Thalaiva’s decision to bring about “spiritual politics” might have raised eyebrows in any other part of the country, but in Tamil Nadu, nobody batted an eyelid. The contribution of film stars to Tamil consciousness is rooted in the philosophies of Periyar and the self-respect movement. The state has a high Human Development Index (HDI) score when it comes to parametres like primary education and healthcare. In a nation that is slanting dangerously close to religion year after year, Tamil Nadu’s Dravidian politics has washed its hands of religion and caste. In fact, Tamil Nadu’s leaders are proud and fierce atheists — from Karunanidhi to Kamal Haasan. Thalaiva has his work cut out. Like in the film   Thalaiva is entering an arena with two established players — the AIADMK and the DMK;  Yet, Rajinikanth is not your average film star getting into politics. He is said to have 55,000 fan clubs in the state, besides a diasporic network of fans. There are legendary stories of his humility, and his unique tradition of returning distributors’ money for films that tank at the box office. In a state that has largely fulfilled its basic needs, Rajinikanth needs to deliver something else this time: faith. But as Thalaiva himself says in   “Once I take up a job, I don’t leave it without completing it... and I don’t take up a job that I can't complete.” Rajini can.",2018-01-11,"Tamil Nadu Assembly,Tamil Nadu,Rajinikanth",Why Rajinikanth joining politics is perfect,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajinikanth-tamil-nadu-politics-lok-sabha-polls-2019/story/1/21673.html
576,Harmeet Shah Singh,"Uncovering secrets in an ecosystem as complex as India's is replete with monumental challenges. One came out last week when   newspaper reported that personal details of citizens could be bought for as little as Rs 500 via WhatsApp. Rachna Khaira, the journalist who broke the story, explained how unknown agents were able to provide access to names, addresses, photos and email aliases from what is advertised as Aadhaar's impregnable database. Her report compounded concerns over the security of the citizens' privileged details at a time when risks of identity fraud have mounted the world over. For cyber criminals, personal information is a gateway to potential scams. Khaira's report was expected to stimulate the UIDAI to generate an environment of confidence and safety when   has been declared a fundamental right. It didn't, unfortunately. Instead, the UIDAI went on a power trip. It filed a police complaint against the reporter and her newspaper among others. Its action rhymed with what is now a pervasive trend to spin unpalatable news reports, no matter how vital they might be to public interest. Investigative journalism is a great public service. As an editor of India Today TV's Special Investigation Team, I can say with conviction that investigative reports stand tall when political stories dominate regular television rundowns and fake news floats freely on social media. This form of journalism is centred on firm impact and not around TV ratings or digital hits. It sets a stellar example of agenda-setting reporting. India Today's enterprising SIT cadre has itself revealed massive scandals, underground economy, organised gangs, education scams, child labour, medical frauds, terror financing and a lot more over the past one year. These journalists have mostly gone undercover to their subjects — and caught them confessing to wrongdoings on hidden cameras. Had it not been for the SIT's exposé of a widespread   in Bihar, India simply wouldn't know about the scale of malpractices inside the state's educational institutions. Its startling reporting on the business of toxic hospital waste brought to light some of the worst forms of environmental and child labour. Our SIT busted black-money mafias across a variety of sectors in the wake of demonetisation. And when this Special Investigation Team broke a mega-exclusive on the Pakistani funding of the Hurriyat in Jammu and Kashmir last year, multiple government agencies swung into action in multiple states. The story set national news agenda for weeks that followed. What drives these courageous investigations is a mission to serve the people's right to information. But now imagine a situation when an investigative reporter is intimidated by the threat of trial for impersonation and cheating. It would suffocate the entire genre of investigative journalism. Remember, undercover reporting is a technique investigative journalists adopt widely across the world in order to get access that would otherwise be declined. They would pose as businesspersons, sport agents, financiers, patients, middlemen and so forth with a sole goal to get the information out for the larger public interest. But what has happened over the first weekend of 2018 is a vicious kick in the teeth of investigative journalism itself. In the world's largest democracy, journalist Rachna Khaira is charged under the IPC's sections related to impersonation, cheating and forgery for exposing glaring holes in the UIDAI's privacy-protection armour. Instead of putting its house in order, the UIDAI has tried to shoot the messenger down. But it's not all doom and gloom. For now, India's media fraternity has stood united against this spiteful tactic to suppress stories that hold power to account. But let's not stop here. Let this campaign be sustained in order to preserve, nourish and protect investigative journalism — that insatiable quest for the realities of power in the face of powerful opposition.",2018-01-09,"Aadhaar,Aadhaar data breach,UIDAI",Why UIDAI's FIR against The Tribune journalist is a kick in the teeth of investigative journalism,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uidai-fir-aadhaar-data-breach-mass-surveillance-investigative-journalism/story/1/21632.html
577,Javed Anwer,"Aadhaar didn't start as surveillance technology. While the concept of a unique ID for all was fuzzy even in the beginning — around 2009 — it was meant to be an authentication technology that would plug leaks in India's welfare schemes. The idea behind Aadhaar seemed well-meaning, but the way it was designed and hurriedly pushed made it evident to keen observers that it was not going to end up well. There were many problems with it, but of particular note was the way Aadhaar would give the government and bureaucrats unnecessary power over individual citizens. Instead of being a tool of inclusion, Aadhaar would be a tool of exclusion. Even in the early stages, it was difficult to imagine that one day the Aadhaar would turn into Frankenstein's monster. In 2018, it has become a tool that has the potential to put every citizen in this country under surveillance. The argument that Aadhaar is a tool to end corruption in India surfaced earlier this decade. After 2012, and exceedingly after 2014, Aadhaar grew in ways it was not meant to when it was conceived. This has happened as the UIDAI — the agency in charge of the Aadhaar programme — acquired unaccountable power over the people of India, and made its operations as secretive and opaque as it can. Fun fact 1: Do you know that under Aadhaar Act 2016, the UIDAI has virtually no accountability, but has provisions that stop Aadhaar users, that is ordinary Indians, from filing any complaint against it in court for the misuse of the UID? Fun fact 2: Do you know Aadhaar was never meant to be an ID card? In the initial days, Aadhaar was linked to government's welfare schemes. For instance, it was made mandatory for issuing ration to all those who held a ration card. This despite the fact that the Supreme Court, in its interim order, told the government that having the Aadhaar card cannot be made mandatory in any way. Post-2015, all hell broke loose. By now, Aadhaar is no longer just technology to authenticate the identity of those entitled to benefits under government welfare schemes. It transformed into an authentication technology for almost everything Indians do. In 2018, if you go by the directives issued by the government, you have to link your Aadhaar to almost everything you own or do. Aadhaar is no longer required only for welfare schemes, like obtaining a ration card, but also if you want to continue using your phone. It is “required”, although not yet mandatory, for availing banking services until March 31 because Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to it. Aadhaar is required for registering births in many parts of India, and even deaths. Aadhaar is required if you want an LPG connection, even if you don't intend to take subsidies. And Aadhaar is required if you want to send your children to school or if you want your degree, and for treatment at many hospitals — even if you are an accident victim and are brought to the emergency with severe head trauma! This is just the beginning. If the Supreme Court dismisses the current challenge to link Aadhaar with every aspect of our lives, be ready to see more Aadhaar in your life. Even simple tasks like buying airline tickets or making hotel reservations or renting homes will soon necessitate Aadhaar authentication. It is important to understand why Aadhaar has become so pervasive. By linking the UID with children’s admissions in private schools, or by linking it with private data, such as your phone number, the government is not saving any money. It is not curbing or cracking down on corruption. It is just putting in place an infrastructure: arguably the world's biggest surveillance apparatus that a country has built to keep an eye on its citizens. Sure, the United States’ NSA will still be bigger, but then NSA for now watches only non-Americans. In the recent years, Aadhaar has metamorphosed into the perfect surveillance tool. It allows the government to collect and record every piece of data that Indians generate as they go about their lives. By storing this data in one place, with Aadhaar as its key, the government will be able to theoretically track and build profiles of every Indian with the UID. There is the argument that we already leave a digital trail whenever we use a phone, carry out a banking transaction, book an air or train ticket or get an LPG connection, and so it doesn't matter that Aadhaar is linked with the service. That is true. But by linking every detail of our existence with Aadhaar, the government puts all of this data in one place and makes it incredibly easy to monitor, record and use. Across the world, governments seek to gain more control over citizens. When they have achieved some level of control, they also abuse it, as history tells us. Even if the original intent is benign, never in the history has a government built surveillance apparatus and not abused it. If we allow Aadhaar to grow unchecked, controlled and managed by an agency with no accountability — and it is the UIDAI that filed an FIR to go after people who pointed out Aadhaar flaws — the results are not going to be pretty.

578,Rajeev Sharma,"The Maldivian regime under President Yameen Abdul Gayoom has changed gears and   to repair bilateral relations in the right earnest. The Gayoom government would be sending its foreign minister Mohamed Asim and defence minister Adam Shareef to India later this month. The proposed dates of Asim and Shareef's visit are January 11 and January 16, respectively. The two visits would be important events for the India-Maldives bilateral relations and a major diplomatic bid by the Gayoom government to build bridges with India after a series of unsavoury episodes. Currently, the India-Maldives relations are frigid on account of a host of incidents in the recent past such as Maldives signing its first-ever Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China despite its avowed ""India-first"" policy, the Maldivian media owing allegiance to President Gayoom severely criticising India in general and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in particular, and restricting Indian envoy Akhilesh Mishra's movements in Maldives. President Gayoom is dispatching his foreign and defence ministers to India in a last-ditch effort to mollify India, greatly hurt by a series of provocations from Maldives, some of which have been mentioned above. Though these ministers would obviously be meeting their Indian counterparts, Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman, their main agenda would be to meet the big man himself, PM Modi. The course the relationship between the two countries takes would all depend on whether Modi is willing to meet the two senior Maldivian ministers. If he does so, it would be construed as a big concession from India and denote that the Modi government is willing to forgive and forget. But as of now the indications are that Modi won't give them an appointment, citing his busy schedule considering that the budget session of Parliament is scheduled to begin from January 29, with the tabling of the Economic Survey. The MEA has confirmed that the Maldivian foreign minister will be calling on PM Modi on January 11 evening. Significantly, Maldives happens to be the only neighbouring country which Modi hasn't visited. He was scheduled to visit the country in March 2015 but cancelled the trip at the last minute after the Gayoom government arrested former president Mohammed Nasheed, a friend of India, under trumped up charges of terrorism and sedition. Since then, India-Maldives relations have been strained. What has greatly upset the Modi government is that the Maldivian media known to be have allegiance with President Gayoom, has criticised PM Modi for his pro-Hindu politics and called him names. Maldives, a tiny nation with a population of just about 4 lakh people (in contrast Delhi's Karol Bagh has a population of over 5 lakh), is a hundred per cent Muslim nation. The   is watching the developments closely and doesn't want Modi to meet the Maldivian ministers. India would be giving a mouthful to the visiting Maldivian ministers over the issues mentioned above and would like to know what concrete actions the Gayoom government has taken or proposes to take in the near future to take care of Indian interests and sensitivities. For example, India would like to see reversal of some India-centric policies that the Gayoom government has implemented over past few weeks. India would like to have a firm commitment from Maldives that it wouldn't unleash its media to poke India in the eye. Some of the statements from Gayoom himself have muddied the waters. Gayoom has of late made several remarks at his public functions wherein he has castigated India without naming the country. The Indian position is that that such remarks, coming from the head of the government, have been too harsh and detrimental to the larger cause of good relations between the two SAARC member states. India would also like to have a commitment from the Gayoom government to have an inclusive domestic policy wherein the Opposition is taken on board, not victimised and repressed as is the trend. India would like to have an assurance that Maldives won't do anything to gag democracy and accord due space to the Opposition given the Maldivian presidential election are due in about eight months. The biggest talking point of India will be to convey a message that Maldives shouldn't play the China card in its dealings with India, something which another SAARC nation Nepal has been doing for decades. While India cannot tell Maldives not to have close relations with any foreign power, including China, New Delhi would be making it clear that Maldives would be playing the China versus India strategic game at its own peril. India is quite upset over the fact that while its envoy in Maldives Akhilesh Mishra is having his movements severely restricted, the Chinese ambassador is being given a special treatment. India is concerned over the manner in which Maldives has on the one hand been wooing China but on the other hand tightening screws on India. Under the Gayoom regime, the Chinese strategic footprints in Maldives have been growing larger and larger while India has continuously been cold-shouldered. The social media trends mirror this situation very well. For example, while workers in Maldives from other countries have been living in shanties, the Chinese have been building plush permanent structures for their workers. But India has its own leverages with regards to Maldives, especially considering the fact that it's much closer to Maldives geographically than powers like China. Also, Gayoom is not unmindful of the Indian leverages. That's why he is sending his ministers on a diplomatic mission.

579,Mrinal Pradhan,"The   has been passed by the Lok Sabha. That is a victory for women, democracy, as well as secularism, but not many people see it that way yet. Let us consider the plight of the average woman in the world today, with US President Donald Trump also being charged with sexual assault in a lot of anecdotal references. Let us also consider the plight of the average Muslim in India, and now consider the plight of women in this light. There is no case one can argue in favour of the men, the husbands of the country, with regard to an issue of their wives’ rights, especially in the case of a right that is well known to be necessary for any human being, not just a Muslim woman. In the 1980s, when Rajiv Gandhi interfered in the famous  case, there were protests that the interference was setting up a dangerous precedent. Thirty years later, the politics of polarisation has resulted in a short, but dangerous history of demolitions, riots, burning of trains, and attacks on non-vegetarians. Now that the government in power, which may well have benefited from the said bloody history, is trying to undo the damage, people (mostly men) are protesting against the new law. They cite that it would be contrary to the prescriptive morals of their way of life. And from their point of view, they may even be right. But the fact remains that a large number of women suffer and have suffered due to the obvious disproportionate distribution of rights between men and women when it comes to the subject of breaking marriages. Some would even say that divorce should be outlawed in Hindu societies, which is also symptomatic of the lack of rights women share globally. The other extreme would say that divorce is fine, but that only men have exclusive rights with regard to divorce. How on earth can one justify the ending of a marriage so arbitrarily when even relationships are seemingly impossible to let go of in an arbitrary fashion? The question of the legitimacy of the bill to criminalise triple talaq is not even relevant here. An appeal to one’s most basic shred of a conscience is enough to justify the legitimacy of women’s rights. Have we all disrespected women so strongly for so long that one has to   that women and men should have equal rights to say the least? Whether this new policy and corresponding law of the Hindu-majority government will be beneficial in the practical sphere or not is subject to the tides of time, but the sheer legitimacy of this law is unquestionable in most commonly held views on ethics. The rest is our choice, sociological or ideological. Secularism implies non-interference in social matters pertaining to religion. However, women’s rights along with many other rights ordinarily considered fundamental to democratic societies are more important for the larger sake of secularism itself. How can it be that through non-interference in social laws the government can protect social rights? Interference of any sort in the metaphysical sphere of things in understandable, but Lord Benedict’s arguments for criminalising Sati a few centuries in the past under the influence of Raja Rammohan Roy, one of India’s premier intellectuals, is as valid today as it was then. If one sees exploitation occurring around them, the first reaction should be to interfere, as positively as possible, to curb that exploitation. The BJP government may hold allegations of inhumanity against them, but a step towards egalitarianism is far more human than burning women alive for dowry, arbitrarily breaking marriages which are alleged to be made in heaven, or forcing girls into child labour. The very fact that the Opposition is not opposing this bill severely is enough proof that even our liberally hated politicians of Delhi are synergistically showing signs of reform. When the Congress majority government of the 1950s decided to implement a uniform codification of all personal law with respect to Hindu law, the then right wing had decided to oppose such change. Now, it is believed that the right-wing government in power may be stepping further towards a uniform civil code for all. Uniformity of social policing notwithstanding, the fate of women is an issue in its own right, globally, and should not be denigrated to a low-key fight for communal compartmentalising. Demonetisation may have allegedly been a failure. However, politically it benefitted Modi, on account of the divide that it created between the rich and poor of our nation. Triple Talaq may be a failure in reality, but it has added to the divide between Muslim women and men. If men do not wish for militaristic feminism in the manner of communist militarism between haves and have-nots, they should tread this line further, namely that of the middle path, protecting women rights without allowing rogue elements to twist the debate in their patriarchal favour. Sooner or later, the consciousness of matriarchy shall step in and destroy the absurd injustices of a thousand years. But until then, the men, leaders, minority spokespersons and such should be forewarned. Women are human, as human as our grandfathers who drove out the British, and eventually, an evil establishment fails through its own contradictions.",2018-01-06,"BJP,Gender Equality,Muslim women,Triple talaq bill",Triple talaq bill: Is it a social reform or a political weapon?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/triple-talaq-bill-muslim-women-gender-equality-bjp/story/1/21584.html
580,Rajeev Dhavan,"The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights of Marriage) Bill 2017 or the triple talaq bill is a vindictive outcome of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Shayara Bano case of last year. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons (SOR), the bill traces its moral authority to fulfil the Supreme Court’s decision that instant divorce (talaq-e-biddat) after three pronouncements was illegal. The SOR says, “The judgment vindicated the position taken by the government that talaq-e-biddat is against Constitutional morality, the dignity of women and principles of gender equity guaranteed under the Constitution.” This, according to the SOR, was in contradistinction to the view of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which wanted to issue advisories. The very wording of the SOR displays a sense of triumph against the Muslim community, a sort of posturing by the government over the Muslim community through the bill. The government’s reading of the Supreme Court judgment is hopelessly misleading. The minority view (of ex CJI JS Khehar and Abdul Nazeer) was that instant talaq is a recognised Islamic practice and it was for the Parliament to intervene if it wanted to. The need for government legislation follows from here. The split majority struck down instant talaq for different reasons. One view was that it was contrary to Islamic law (Kurien), the other that it violated constitutional equality (Nariman–Lalit). The government’s flowery reference to constitutional morality and gender ""equity"" is based on this latter minority view because the second majority judgment simply declared it contrary to Islamic law. The bill emanates from the imagination of the government to (a) showcase Muslim law as unjust and (b) instrument a careless and vindictive law to break up Muslim marriages. Once the court declared instant talaq to be illegal and unconstitutional, the simple declaration in Clause 3 outlawing any form of instant triple talaq was enough: “Any pronouncement of talaq by a person upon his wife, by words either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever is illegal.” At first blush, Clause 3 gives the broad impression that “talaq” itself is illegal. Of course, “talaq” in the definition clause limits the bill to talaq-ebiddat or all forms of instant talaq. A clever presentation — too clever. But after the SC declaration that instant talaq is illegal, this meant the marriage subsists with all the obligations of Islamic law. Here the bill takes an “ugly turn”. It assumes that although instant talaq is illegal, but with its pronouncement, the marriage itself has broken down requiring remedial action. It gives the right to subsistence allowance and custody of children to the wife similar to divorce proceedings when marriages break up. The bill assumes that the illegal declaration of talaq by the husband virtually breaks up the marriage requiring questions of subsistence allowance to be adjudicated by a Magistrate. In other words, the declaration of instant talaq accelerates a marriage breakdown when the real purpose of the Supreme Court and, supposedly the bill was that the marriage remains alive and well. But the bill regards the very utterance of instant divorce as a kind of breakdown or judicial separation requiring magisterial intervention on maintenance and custody. This is the evil effect of the bill to break the marriage rather than cement it. Why “subsistence allowance”? If instant talaq is illegal, the wife is lawfully wedded with full privileges of a wife. “Subsistence allowance” is a step down — legislative cruelty denying the wife and children total rights. How absurd can this be? A fully wedded wife not legally divorced by her husband will be entitled to only adjudicated subsistence for herself and her children. This part of the bill is antigender, anti-SC judgment, anti-common sense and directed to break up marital relations. The fully wedded wife would run off to a Magistrate for what happens in judicial separation or divorce for relief. Husband and wife are put in legal attrition Finally, the criminality provisions are provocative and irresponsible. Clause 7 means that if the husband utters the instant talaq words, he would commit “an offence which is cognisable and non-bailable”. This means he can be arrested by police and remain in investigative custody unless the Magistrate intervenes. Is this designed to cure the marriage or perpetuate discord? Everything illegal is not a crime. Making it criminal, distorts the relationship between parties. The BJP uses its majority in Lok Sabha to do what it likes. On December 20, 2017, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad answered that after the SC judgment, 99 cases of instant talaq were reported. Is that enough to punish the Muslim community, causing legal quarrels between husband and wife and sending the husband to jail for up to three years. The debate was sparse. The Opposition quiet. So what if they were in a minority, the Opposition should have torn apart the whole bill (not just the penal provisions). In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition put up a fight. But gradually it also caved in — agreeable to compromise on the pen provision not being cognisable and non-bailable. The bill was not passed in the Winter session. But it should be circulated for public opinion or, at least, sent to a select Parliamentary committee as demanded by some members. This is an unfair bill produced by BJP majoritarianism.

581,Shiv Visvanathan,"Rajinikanth is legendary. He belongs not just to the world of movies, but is part of folklore. He is a metaphor for the miracle we call films. His very entry brought a democratic ease to film. I remember Rajinikanth was a bus conductor. He was once asked by a journalist, “If you had not been a bus conductor-turned-film star, what would you have been?” Quick came the answer, “Oh, a smuggler or a bootlegger.” Rajini was emphasising the fundamental equality of all occupations in the informal economy, from where Kollywood scripts often originate. That was decades ago. When Rajinikanth announced he is going to join politics, start a new political party, the enthusiasm did not work out like the release of his films. The DMK and the AIADMK felt he was not real enough for politics. Many academic activists were even dismissive, arguing that Rajini had taken no real stands in politics. But the problem is a more complex one. Rajini is older. Maybe legends do not age, but Tamil Nadu as a society has. The golden age of politics and its creativity, reciprocity to film is over. Annadurai and MGR are gone, the DMK under Stalin appears a bit like a political still life. The DMK-AIADMK battles that dominated the last few decades create little excitement. In fact, the most exciting person in Chennai is Jayalalithaa. Even as a dead person, she could sweep the election. She has the charisma even as memory to make crowds hysterical and hysteria can flow like a religious current in this city. But what is more obvious than Jayalalithaa’s absence as presence is the emptiness of Tamil politics. Despite being a corrupt prima dona, Jaya had the makings of a Tamil deity. There is a touch of the lukewarm to Rajini’s entry. Probably English language newspapers are more deadpan about it. They make his entry sound like a benign Rotary club meeting. But once one hears Rajini in Tamil, he seems a different person, more in command, almost prophetic about the new digital constituencies he is planning to create. Rajini still offers the politics of hope Tamil Nadu so desperately needs. One break on this move reaching a cinematic climax is the political future of another great star, Kamal Haasan. Haasan too wants to enter politics and make a difference. His seems more the voice of the left, but one is not clear whether Haasan is speaking of his sympathisers on the left or of a need for a fully articulated leftist ideology. While both still stand like Achilles before their tents, Amit Shah and BJP seem busy. They realise the potential of the moment as all the big parties seems dormant. They realise that the creation of a Trojan horse would have a deadly effect, but one wonders whether Tamil Nadu would forgive any one for playing a Trojan horse in a cinematic sense. Tamil Nadu as a society has always been proud of its autonomy from Delhi. Even Modi at the height of his power cut little ice with Jayalalithaa. Yet it is the emptying of politics that haunts one. Tamil Nadu lacks a Periyaar, a Kamraj, a Rajaji and an Annadurai. Each could have mobilised the imagination. Today’s party leaders stand like Uriah Heaps, their very secondariness is so obvious.  The very emptiness of political space is begging Rajini to enter. He realises that he has to offer something new and that the newness of his politics has to at least match the enthusiasm Delhi felt for Kejriwal before he became a more domestic figure. Rajini claims he wants to create a political revolution, the beginning of a spiritual politics. I guess it is his way of saying he wants to initiate an honest politics without invoking a critique of Jaya or DMK. He talks of a politics devoid of caste and religion. I guess what he is looking for is sociology of a new constituency different from the current vote banks that have tied up politics into predictable rhetorical grids. What he is hoping to trigger is a generational change in livelihood and lifestyle, which could redefine society. The script as it stands today sounds empty, or at best, well-intentioned. Rajini does not project the ease of politics. He stands like a star waiting for a cue from the director, desperate for the right plot and the right lines. But the moment, in terms of its timing, has tremendous potential. A new generation wants to rewrite society and Rajini has the stature to lead them. Maybe it is time civil society came to his aide, preparing an ideological programme, and create a new reciprocity between civil society and politics. One is thinking in particular of an attempt to revive the fate of agriculture, marked by epidemics of suicide. What is true of farming is also is also becoming true of fishing. The recent impact of Cyclone Ockhi revealed that the Tamil Nadu politician had no sense of the travails of deep sea fishing. If livelihood politics, human rights and ecology were to combine once more embedded in a theory of culture and the creativity of language, Tamil Nadu can offer a new politics to a Modi embroiled India. I do not think this is the time for cynics or for so-called realists to say that Tamil Nadu politics will continue to see-saw between factions of the Dravidian movement. Rajini has the charisma, and civil society, composed of ecologists, feminists, educationalists, can provide the content for a progressive dream. Like a good actor, Rajini knows how to pick his cues and like a charismatic politician, he can give such ideas a drama, a force which can create a new dream of politics. Society cannot play spectator for long. It has to script the new dream of politics, brushing aside the tiredness and staleness of the old profession politician. It is time for the miracle to happen.

582,Sahil Joshi,"It is one thing to prop up an ""incidental-Dalit"" as the country's president to flaunt faux inclusivity and quite another to challenge upper caste Hindutva authoritarianism. It's one thing to distort political remarks and shed tears about ""neech jati"" and quite another to crack the whip on caustic rightwing troublemakers whom you revere as your guru. As Maharashtra descended into chaos following the violence orchestrated by rightwing leaders Sambaji Bhide Guruji and Milind Ekbote during the 200th anniversary celebrations of the  , the BJP found itself torn between condemning the rabble-rousers and asserting a pro-Dalit stance to shed the party's label of being an upper-caste party. What seemed easier, obviously, was to keep quiet. In Maharashtra's history of Dalit versus others, two incidents in the past saw a major shift in political dynamics. Back in early 1980s, the Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence when egged on by his ""troubled conscience"" former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar University. After a 16-year-old campaign - Namantar Andolan - Dalits half-succeeded in renaming Aurangabad's Marathawada University to Dr BR Ambedkar Marathwada University. Pawar though was made to pay for his ""altruism"" later as he lost the support of the Maratha community even as Shiv Sena, which strictly opposed the renaming move, further strengthened its base. Pawar, who used to enjoy considerable popularity in the area, could never ""recuperate"" and lost his base among the Marathas. Several attempts to undo the hurt failed as the Namantar Andolan had left the fissures wide open. In another incident which went on to change the political equations in the state, Mumbai police, back in 1997, opened fire upon residents of Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar in Ghatkopar who were protesting against the desecration of Ambedkar's statue. The police firing claimed as many as 10 lives. The incident led to significant unrest throughout Maharashtra, including rioting and social boycotts against the protesting Dalits.  Although the then Shiv Sena government justified the police action, many couldn't overlook the fact that those in power find it justifiable to use excessive force to muzzle Dalit assertion. This particular incident brought together Dalit groups, including the one led by Prakash Ambedkar and Ramdas Atahawale. The impact of the Ghatkopar incident could be seen in 1998 Lok Sabha elections. Despite riding high on the Ram Mandir issue, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine was brought to its knees by the grand coalition of all republican factions with the Congress and its allies winning 37 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats. Pramod Mahajan too lost his Mumbai North East seat (Ghatkopar East and West Assembly segments fall under Mumbai-North East) due to wide spread anger against the police brutality in Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar. The following year in 1999, the Shiv Sena-BJP lost the Assembly elections in Maharshtra. Following the latest spate of violence in Maharashtra, many believe the Bhima-Koregaon episode could prove to be chief minister Davendra Fadnavis' Ramabai Nagar moment.  Even though Fadnavis has been patting the back of his government ""for not letting the violence go out of hand"", the Sena, this time, tore into the BJP government over the violence saying ""the only work left [for the BJP] is to fight elections using the government machinery and the police"". While the BJP doesn't have any prominent Dalit face in Maharashtra, the Bhima Koregaon violence, in all likelihood, will only increase the party's dependence on Union minister Ramdas Athavale, who for years was a staunch opponent of the RSS. The BJP for long has tried to shed its upper-caste label. In 1990s, Parmod Mahajan tried to break the BJP's image of a ""shetji bhatji’ (Baniya-Brahman) party with the help of Gopinath Munde by wooing the OBCs. While Munde became the BJP's OBC face, Dalits still remained far away. Dalits, who form around 11 per cent of the population in Maharshtra, have been a solid social block behind the Congress and Pawar's NCP. After winning the 2014 Assembly elections, the BJP tried its best to bring the Dalits into its fold. It was precisely why Athawale - one of the prominent Dalit faces of Maharashtra - was brought to Rajya Sabha and then made a Union minister. Despite that, Dalit support to the BJP remains elusive. With the latest spate of violence, the BJP will find it harder to decide whether to woo the Dalits or to rile the Marathas, who form about 30 per cent of the state's population. ",2018-01-05,"Bhima Koregaon,Hindutva,British Rule,Peshwa",How Bhima Koregaon violence poses a major risk to BJP's Dalit politics,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-upper-caste-bjp-fadnavis-brahmins-dalits-atrocities-violence-hindutva/story/1/21563.html
583,Chandra Kumar Bose,"""Rose early but found Prabha still suffering. A son was born at midday..,"" reads a brief entry in Janakinath Bose's diary dated January 23, 1897. The newborn, the ninth child of Janakinath and Prabhabati Devi, was named Subhas. Janakinath was then practising law in Cuttack, in the state of Orissa. He headed a large extended family.   later recalled in his autobiography,  , he felt ""like a thoroughly insignificant being. My parents awed me to a degree"", in the family. It is now 121 years since the birth of Subhas Chandra Bose, and 73 years since his last known journey out of South East Asia, reportedly to the Soviet Union, in mid-August 1945. On January 23 every year Subhas' birth anniversary is celebrated across India. Speeches extolling Bose's charisma and personality, his unique contributions towards Indian independence continue to be made, and stirring national songs continue to be sung in his honour. On that day, in addition to institutionally sponsored events, spontaneous remembrance ceremonies organised by neighbourhood and citizens' groups also take place. This is a unique feature associated only with   birth anniversary which reflects the depth of people's veneration for him after more than half-a-century of his disappearance. This, in a sense, is a fitting tribute to a man who dedicated his life to liberating India from British colonial rule, and had a vision to make ""Free India"" one of the leading nations in the world. But January 23 will pass and Bose will again be relegated to the pages of history. Though deified by many, his ideology and mission are forgotten. Worse, they are not even known by the younger generations of Indians. From his entry into the Indian political movement in the early 1920s, through his prison years and bouts of serious illnesses, Subhas had developed his thoughts on social, political and economic issues which then formed the basis of his ideology. His famous address as the president of the 51st session of the Indian National Congress at Haripura in 1938 contains the crux of his political and economic thinking and plans. Is it widely known that it was in Haripura that Subhas launched the very first Planning Commission for India? In all his key addresses in India and abroad, in articles published in various journals, Subhas articulated his vision for a free India. In his view, the most important problems to be addressed in independent India were that of poverty, unemployment and illiteracy, challenges which have not been met even after 70 years of independence. Together with the celebratory functions, a more fitting tribute to Subhas' memory will be to effectively propagate his vision and ideology, which will in turn promote a better understanding of the history and politics of India, and also inspire the present generation of Indians to shape the country on the basis of the high moral values and principles that Subhas stood for and practised all his life. Subhas' works should be part of school and university curricula. Research institutes, including Netaji Subhas Foundation, Kolkata and London, should actively encourage and support national and international scholars to reassess Subhas' role in the Indian independence movement, and also his contemporary relevance. A deeper study of his works will show that many of his social and economic plans still remain valid. In the current Indian situation where there is a bankruptcy of leadership, ideas, commitment and action, Subhas' message, through his writings, speeches and commentaries may help to resurrect the failing morale of those who are working to bring positive change in this country. Above all,   life-long emphasis on the importance of communal harmony and unity among people, irrespective of birth, caste, creed and religion, has not only remained relevant, it has also gained a sense of urgency. In a world torn by ethnic, tribal, religious and regional conflicts, Bose's unqualified rejection of bigotry of any kind from the very outset of his entry into the Indian political scene, and his repeated call for unity among all Indians, famously reflected in the motto of the Indian National Army - Unity, Faith and Sacrifice, alone can help create a secure foundation of contemporary India. Conscious of the grave danger that communalism posed to a country such as India, where people of many faiths were inextricably mixed together over centuries, Subhas had repeatedly warned against the virus of religious bigotry entering the fabric of politics. In referring to what should be the attitude towards religion and caste, Subhas had declared ""... the government of free India must have an absolutely neutral and impartial attitude toward all religions and leave it to the choice of every individual to profess or follow a particular religious faith"" (The Fundamental Problems of India, address at Tokyo University, November 1944). Subhas' legacy will be better served if he is brought alive through his works. However, there is another reality. During the time of the British Raj, Subhas was treated as enemy No 1 and his book  , banned across the coutry. This is understandable and could have been expected from a colonial power determined to hold on to India and ready to suppress any threat to its rule. It is therefore particularly ironic that after the government of free India took charge, a systematic attempt was made to reduce Subhas merely to a Bengal hero, who though deemed idealistic, was seen as a misled individual, and had made the terrible mistake of discarding Mahatma Gandhi's non violent ways in India's freedom struggle. It is only because Subhas had entered the minds and hearts of the Indian people, and of the peoples of Asia, that all attempts at diminishing his stature and role in Indian and global politics have not fully succeeded. The role of the first government of independent India under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in this process of suppression and distortion cannot be ignored or denied. Historians have noted that Nehru had always perceived Subhas as his main rival, and his own statements bear evidence to that fact. Subhas himself had once written that ""nobody has done more harm to me personally and to our cause in this crisis than Pandit Nehru"" (letter to his nephew Amiya Nath Bose, April 17, 1939). As more evidence begins to emerge, it will be possible to make an objective and proper assessment of the role and personalities of our leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and others. When in August 1945 Subhas disappeared, his beloved elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose was in prison. Sarat and Subhas had shared an extraordinary relationship as brothers. Their close personal and emotional bond was enriched and deepened by their shared social and political ideology and goals. After Sarat was released in September 1945, he immediately resumed his campaign for a free and united India. He also decided to acquire the family's ancestral house on Elgin Road in Calcutta to establish an institution for the study and propagation of Subhas' ideology. In 1946, Sarat inaugurated ""Netaji Bhawan"" at their ancestral house and laid the foundations for a Netaji museum and research centre in the name of his brother, who was by then popularly known as Netaji (our leader). It was Sarat's wish that the Bose house should also be used for public and charitable purposes. The Azad Hind Ambulance Service, which he started, provided much-needed medical and social services in the city, especially during the dark days of communal strife. These were tumultuous times for Bengal and India as a whole. A new alternative was beginning to emerge in Bengal's political firmament. Hope turned to Sarat Bose to carry the torch ahead. He became the undisputed leader of the Congress in West Bengal. He was then elected leader of the Congress in the Central Legislative Assembly and became the leader of the Opposition. Sarat's membership of the interim government was, however, short-lived. He left the interim cabinet and the Congress refusing to agree to the partition of India on communal lines. Within a few years, a greater tragedy was to strike. On February 20, 1950, the very morning Sarat was to make an urgent appeal to the people of the two Bengals to reunite, he suddenly passed away. In an attempt to keep alive Bose's legacy and to give it concrete shape, the close followers of the Bose brothers, supported by Sarat's family, set up Sarat Bose Academy at Netaji Bhawan in 1952. It gathered within its fold eminent historians, lawyers, journalists and other committed voluntary workers. It also attracted interested persons from overseas. The academy launched an ambitious programme to develop Netaji Bhawan as a centre of excellence for research and exchange on both national and international affairs. It also aimed to function as a centre for the promotion of arts, music and languages, while continuing to provide other public services. It was to be the main archive for the works of Sarat and Subhas and for all types of documents and records related to them. The major objective of collecting key documents as well as photos and films on the life and activities of Subhas Chandra Bose began in earnest. Amiya Nath Bose, general secretary of Sarat Bose Academy, who took up his father Sarat's mantle, engaged himself fully in this task. He collected a substantial amount of materials, including primary documents, newspaper clippings, journals, films and other stuff on Netaji's activities both from India and abroad. All of these materials were deposited at the Netaji Museum and archives to be made available ""... to students and scholars for the study of and research about the life and work of Netaji..."" The Sarat Bose Academy began publication of Subhas and Sarat's works, and set up a comprehensive photographic exhibition portraying the life and work of the Bose brothers. By the late 1950s, significant progress had been made in the collection of materials for the Netaji Museum and its archives, and it was concluded that it would be appropriate to create a separate body ""to undertake a systematic study of Netaji's life and mission"". This ultimately led to the creation of the Netaji Research Bureau in 1957 under the chairmanship of well-known journalist Satya Ranjan Bakshi and Sisir Kumar Bose (a son of Sarat Bose) as general secretary. Thus, Netaji Bhawan, with its three main organs - Sarat Bose Academy, Netaji Research Bureau and Azad Hind Ambulance Service - was designed to act as the lead institution to uphold and promote the Bose brothers' legacy, and to work towards realising their cherished goals. However, here again the forces bent upon destroying the legacy went to work. Gradually, the Netaji Research Bureau came under the direct influence of the Nehru dynasty dominated central government. The Sarat Bose Academy moved out of Netaji Bhawan. Netaji Research Bureau became the only organ to remain under the directorship of Sisir Bose. Since its inception until now, over a period of 61 years, the Netaji Research Bureau has accomplished one of its basic goals and has published in 12 volumes, almost all of the writings, speeches and letters of Subhas, the bulk of which was originally collected under the auspices of Sarat Bose Academy. The Netaji Research Bureau has reportedly obtained substantial funding from the central government. But judged against its own objectives, and what was envisaged by its founders, the work of Netaji Research Bureau may be said to have been limited. Netaji's own works are not widely available, and conditions to access the archives at Netaji Bhawan are obscure. Was there a price to pay for support from those who have an interest in keeping the Bose brother's legacy in check? In view of the current realities of India today, those who believe in Subhas' ideology and its relevance in contemporary India, must take the initiative to revive, disseminate and act on the basis of that ideology. Such initiatives are already being taken by certain civil society and media groups both in India and abroad. A website is being launched by The Bose Legacy - www.theboselegacy.com - which will be an online archive for all of Subhas' works, a data base of bibliographies and scholars. It will also contain photographs and audio-visual material. The overall objective is to provide access to relevant materials to all those who wish to study the life, activities and ideology of Subhas, and also to those who wish to define their actions in terms of Bose's vision of India and the world.

584,Kamlesh Sutar,"As one enters Sangli, the turmeric town of Maharashtra, the influence of Maratha history can be seen written all over the grand wooden houses. From small mandals (groups) to chowks, almost everything is named after Hindutva icons. No wonder the controversial Sambhaji Bhide chose this place as his Karma bhoomi. On reaching Sangli on December 4, we saw a huge procession in support of Bhide, who is fondly called as Bhide Guruji by his followers. The 85-year-old founder of Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan is accused of orchestrating the violence at the   of the battle fought 200 years ago in Bhima Koregaon. As we headed towards his house in Gaonbhag area, we were told that Guruji does not carry a cellphone (or ""bhraman dhwani"" as he calls it). So once he picks up his bicycle and leaves, no one knows his whereabouts. The Datta Niwas building is situated in a narrow bylane of the old town. A police van was parked outside the lane, even though Bhide has not been provided any security cover. As we neared his house, it seemed almost everyone knew the way to his first-floor abode. However, much to our disappointment, we found ourselves staring at a lock on the door. We left a small note at the doorstep. Not too many people know about the staunch Hindutva ideologue, especially outside Maharashtra, but for those who have closely followed the state's identity politics, Bhide Guruji is a familiar name. An ardent follower of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, many say, Bhide's real name is Manohar but he calls himself Sambhaji after the Maratha king. Maratha organisations like Sambhaji Brigade or Maratha Mahasangh allege that Bhide, who is an upper caste Brahmin, deliberately professes Maratha history in a Brahminical perspective. Guruji has a sizeable following in western Maharashtra, particularly in Sangli district, and parts of neighbouring Karnataka. The man with a magnum moustache is usually dressed in a white kurta pajama or dhoti, but never wears a footwear - no matter where he goes. His followers say that Bhide is an MSc in nuclear physics from Pune University and has also served as a professor in Pune's Fergusson College long ago. In Sangli, Bhide is often seen riding a bicycle. He delivers sermons on Shivaji and Sambhaji, most of which are focused on the warrior kings as Hindutva icons. In 2009, he found himself embroiled in a controversy when communal violence broke out in the twin cities of Miraj-Sangli in Sangli district during Ganpati visarjan over an arch, sporting a poster that depicted the slaying of Afzhal Khan - the most capable commander of Ali Adil Shah II of the Bijapur Sultanate - at the hands of Chhatrapati Shivaji. It was reportedly erected just a day before Ganesh visarjan. Even though many demanded his arrest, Bhide came out ""victorious"" without a single scratch. The man is known for his fiery talks on the lives of Shivaji Maharaj heavily laced with hatred for Muslims. And until the recent Bhima Koregaon violence, which Bhide is accused of inciting along with Milind Ekbote, he was not known to be anti-Dalit. Bhide's Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan is mainly known for training youths in physical education. Every year during Navratri, Bhide organises a marathon called ""Durga Daud"". Many prominent politicians in the past have graced the event. Not widely known outside Maharashtra, Bhide made national headlines in 2014 when Prime Minister  , during a 2014 Assembly election rally in Sangli, reportedly referred to the hardcore Hindutva activist as one of his inspirations. ""Bhide Guruji did not invite me here. I came here on his orders,” Modi had said during the rally,"" Modi had said. Those close to Bhide say the once-RSS pracharak split from the Sangh Parivar following difference of opinion with former RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras. Ever since then he has been busy running the Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan, albeit on the lines of the RSS. Much like the practice in RSS shakhas, we came to know, Bhide and his followers gather at their office every morning for workout sessions. We decided to catch up with him there. On a cold Friday morning, our team reached the Vishnu Ghat on the banks of river Krishna. A group of men had already begun their ""surya namaskar"" amid chanting of mantras. We were told that Bhide usually reaches by 5am. We kept waiting on the stairs of a temple watching another group of senior citizens practising laughter yoga. A while later, Bhide came riding his old bicycle. After greeting us, the first thing he asked us to do was to put aside our cameras. He then asked us to join us in his morning prayers and introduced us to others as ""guests of Sangli from Mumbai"". The prayers started with ""Jayatu Hindu Rashtram (long Iive the Hindu nation)"". While the prayers, offered to goddess Bhawani, praised Shivaji and Sambhaji, it was difficult to miss the religious undertones. After the prayers, the group got ready for another round of surya namaskar. Bhide, we were told, has added two additional surya mantras to the usual cycle in the name of Shivaji and Sambhaji. After we joined him in his workout and prayers, the man seemed comfortable talking to us. As soon as he is asked about the Bhima Koregaon violence, he vehemently claimed innocence and said it was a political conspiracy. He even appealed for a thorough inquiry into the incident. Giving examples from Mahabharata, he told us that even ""lord Krishna had to face allegations of theft"". As he got up to leave on his cycle cutting through a line of followers who had gathered to meet him, it was clear Bhide's no ordinary man.",2018-01-05,"Hindutva,Dalit atrocities,Bhima Koregaon,Sambhaji Bhide",On meeting Bhima Koregaon violence accused Sambhaji Bhide,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sambhaji-bhide-sangli-house-bhima-koregaon-dalit-atrocities-bhide-guruji-violence-hindutva/story/1/21569.html
585,Sourish Bhattacharyya,"The manufactured outrage over the annual Dalit-led celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the  , unless seen through the pseudo-nationalist lenses, is yet another aggressive Hindutva attempt to muzzle the new Dalit voices that are becoming louder after the marginalisation of the likes of Mayawati and Ramdas Athawale. It is an expression of the venomous bigotry that drives the ill-informed Hindutva narrative - the very same bigotry that sparked off the Karni Sena anger against  , a film purportedly (I use the word deliberately because no one has seen it, apart from Arnab Goswami and Rajat Sharma, outside the CBFC) based on an allegorical Sufi poem written in 1540 CE by a Muslim, Malik Muhammad Jayasi, about a fictional princess from Sinhala (modern-day Sri Lanka; note, she wasn't a Rajput), who becomes the queen of Chittor, and Allauddin Khilji falls in love with her. Understandably, the country has gone into election mode, and Hindutva loyalists have little to brag about after three and half years in power, except an economy where the fiscal deficit has spiralled out of control, jobs are hard to find, the farming sector is wracked by crises and prices of essential commodities showing no signs of abatement, even as Pakistan continues to kill and maim our braveheart soldiers in cold blood. There's only one way to deflect national attention away from the paralysis of equitable development that has set in. And the cynical strategy is to   to polarise voters - Hindus against Muslims and Christians, and the upper castes against Dalits. It started with the so-called ""love jihad"" and the alleged cow smugglers, but the virus, post-Gujarat Assembly elections, has infected the national discourse. Branding Rahul Gandhi as being anti-triple talaq bill when all his party, along with 17 others, has asked for is a parliamentary select committee review of one provision of the bill, is the latest expression of this nation-corroding argument. Questioning the legitimacy of Jignesh Mevani joining the annual celebrations of the Battle of Koregaon - the victory of a unit of the East India Company (comprising 900 Mahar soldiers) over the Peshwa Bajirao II's army in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, a commemoration whose history goes back to January 1, 1927, when BR Ambedkar started the tradition as an assertion of Dalit opposition to upper caste oppression, which had been institutionalised by the Brahminical Peshwas - is a strand of the same divisive narrative. Any Indian citizen can legitimately join a celebration, even it has political overtones, in any part of the country. If a Bhojpuri film star can represent North East Delhi and become the president of the BJP's Delhi unit, how can Jigesh Mevani be questioned for emerging as yet another national voice of the Dalits? Only those with a Peshwa mindset will parrot (reminds me of Padmavati's parrot in Jayasi's poem) such arguments, including the one linking Mevani with Umar Khalid, who, like any other Indian citizen, has the right to engage in a political or any other activity in any part of the country. This argument is as destructive as the mischievous misrepresentation of the acronym HAJ (Hardik, Alpesh and Jignesh) formed with the first letters of the names of the three youth leaders who turned the political tide in Gujarat during the recent elections. Politics aside, let's turn to facts to make sense of the mayhem that just shook Maharashtra: 1) It was Chhatrapati Shivaji, who's much loved by the Hindutva army, who inducted Mahars into his army as scouts and guards of forts. 2) The tradition was discontinued by the Peshwas, who heaped inhuman insults upon the Mahars, like insisting that they have a broom tied to their back (to clear their footprints) and hang an earthen pitcher from their necks to prevent their shadow from ""polluting"" the streets. The celebration of the East India Company's victory in the Battle of Koregaon is not a homage paid to a colonial army, but an assertion of Dalit power against Brahminical oppression. 3) If the celebration of the Battle of Koregaon tantamounts to paying homage to colonialism, then the BJP, too, stands guilty of the same charge because of its opposition in Karnataka to Tipu Sultan, who fought the East India Company till his last dying moment. 4) After the Second Anglo-Afghan War, when British colonial generals, led by Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, floated the myth of the martial races, the Mahars were edged out of the British Indian Army and eventually the regiment bearing the name of the caste was disbanded in 1895. For the Mahars, the army provided an escape from their dehumanised life in a caste-oppressed society, which was why they kept demanding that their regiment be reinstated - a demand that was supported by Mahatma Gandhi's political guru, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and later, the Indian National Congress even though it was opposed to the army recruitment policies of the British Raj. 5) It was the British Indian Army that provided a caste-free upbringing to BR Ambedkar, whose father, Subedar Ramji Sakpal, was a teacher in the Mahar Regiment school at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. That may have been the reason why Ambedkar, as member of the viceroy's Defence Advisory Committee in 1941, made a strong pitch for the revival of the Mahar Regiment. 6) The viceroy accepted Ambedkar's plea and the first battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum in October 1941. In the years that followed until Independence, the regiment expanded steadily, saw action in Burma and Iraq, was among the first to become a machine gun regiment in 1946 (it was then that the Koregaon Victory Pillar, the scene of the January 1 celebrations, was replaced by two crossed Vickers machine guns on the regimental crest), and provided security to refugees during the Partition bloodbath. Post-Independence, it became a more integrative unit with the induction of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujaratis who were rejected as non-martial by the British. The Mahars today are 21 battalions strong and have produced two distinguished Army chiefs, General KV Krishna Rao and General K Sundarji. Most importantly, the regiment has given the community back the self-pride that the Peshwas had snuffed out. Hindutva bullies who don't want the Dalits to celebrate their moment of freedom are pursuing cynical electoral manoeuvres that can only lead to one loss - the inclusive idea of India that had been so caringly seeded by Jawaharlal Nehru and nurtured by all those who practise the politics of inclusion.",2018-01-04,"RSS,Hindutva,Dalits,Bhima Koregaon",Attack on Dalits celebrating the 200th anniversary of Battle of Koregaon is a forewarning on what's to come,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-dalits-hindutva-maharashtra-bandh-rss-jignesh-mevani-umar-khalid/story/1/21544.html
586,Rajeev Sharma,"The real intentions of Pakistan behind the Christmas Day meeting between Kulbhushan Jadhav and his wife and mother - with a glass partition in between - have been exposed by Maulana Ameer Hamza, one of the founders of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). That the entire event was stage-managed by Pakistan to score brownie-points against India was revealed by Maulana Ameer Hamza at a public rally last week in Rawalpindi when he  : ""ISI and Pakistan government humiliated Jadhav's family during their visit to Islamabad. They also made Jadhav face his family across a glass wall… India had requested Pakistan to allow Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet him. Pakistan showed mercy and invited them. India thought that they would meet Jadhav face-to-face on a sofa, but the ISI didn’t allow it.” Hamza's boastful remarks indicate the following: 1) The meeting between Jadhav and his wife and mother was a charade, meant to humiliate the Jadhav family and send a wry message to India; 2) The existence of a nefarious nexus between the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and Pakistan government and how the ISI choreographed the entire event though preparations for the meeting were largely between the foreign offices of the two countries; 3) The camaraderie between terror outfits and the Pakistani military establishment as Maulana Ameer Hamza was speaking at a public rally which couldn’t have taken place without the ISI's prior approval and the fact that he sought to lionise the ISI at the Rawalpindi rally. Does it not sound weird that the leader of a notorious terror outfit praises the host country’s premier intelligence agency? Such a scenario would have been shameful for any civilised nation, but in Pakistan it is a routine. It’s not for nothing that Pakistan is repeatedly hauled over the coals by the international community over terrorism, the latest in this never-ending series being extremely tough remarks against Pakistan by US President Donald Trump. Pakistan took the extreme measure of allowing Kulbhushan Jadhav to meet his mother and wife knowing that they needed to pre-empt any strictures being passed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). On September 13, India submitted its written pleadings to the ICJ. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, while responding to a question regarding the development, had stated that ""India has…submitted its memorial (written pleadings) to the ICJ in the Jadhav case involving egregious violation of Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 by Pakistan. This is in furtherance of our application filed before the Court on May 8, 2017"". Earlier in May 2017, the ICJ had stayed Jadhav’s execution by Pakistan and had asked both parties to submit their written pleadings by September 13, 2017. Pakistani commentator Ejaz Haider had recently commented in an  : ""That Jadhav is important for India is a no-brainer and can be evidenced by New Delhi approaching the ICJ."" One could counter that by saying thus: “That Jadhav is important to Pakistan is a no-brainer and can be evidenced by Pakistan constantly using him as a tool to pick on India sponsoring terrorism in Balochistan.”  The reality is that Pakistan got Jadhav on a platter and is using him to the hilt. It needs to be recalled that Jadhav was kidnapped in Iran and delivered to Pakistan by a faction of the Taliban working for Iran. The Taliban sold him to the Pakistanis for a price. And thereby hangs the tale. Pakistan first announced that they would accede to the Indian request to let Jadhav’s family meet him in Pakistan and promptly provided visas for the same on December 20, 2017. However, it is noteworthy that Pakistan did not grant consular access to any authorised personnel of the Indian Mission in Islamabad prior to the meeting, but instead only permitted the family to meet Jadhav. The meeting on December 25 was more of a charade than a meeting on humanitarian grounds. Importantly, the family was not allowed to converse in Marathi with Jadhav, to ensure that the Pakistanis could understand what exchange took place between the prisoner and his family. The family’s meeting with Jadhav, according to their own version, showed that Jadhav was under stress and spoke under coercion. Pakistan subsequently claimed that the procedure followed for the meeting, including asking the mother and wife to change their attire, had been agreed to by both countries in advance, a fact which India has firmly denied. Earlier in September last year, Pakistan's foreign minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, let out a canard that there was a   for a swap between Jadhav and a Pakistani who was involved in the Peshawar Army Public School attack and was said to be in Afghan custody. Asif claimed that India’s NSA Ajit Doval had told him that India could exchange that terrorist with the ""terrorist"" Pakistan had, namely Jadhav. Asif made these remarks while speaking at the Asia Society in New York, but the idea was quickly shot down by both India and Afghanistan. The issue of a swap may well have been discussed at some stage, but there appears to be no reason why Afghanistan should give their acquiescence to an Indian request to let off a known Afghan terrorist in their custody. Furthermore, if one goes back to reports of the terrorist strike at the APS Peshawar, there were six terrorists involved in the attack - one Chechen, two Afghans and three Arabs. In the rescue operation carried out by Pakistani Special Services Group, all six terrorists were killed. So who is this special guy the Afghans were holding on to as Asif claimed in September 2017? The mastermind of the Peshawar attack Omar Khorasani, was killed in a drone strike in October 2017. So much for Pakistan's claims of being the honest dealer and allowing India to meet with the family of commander Kulbhushan Jadhav. By the way, Jadhav is not a serving Indian Navy officer and had, in fact, retired in 2001. He had been working independently in Chahbahar Port in Iran since 2003. At the time of his arrest in March 2016, the Pakistani establishment planted a fake passport on him in the name of Hussein Mubarak Patel and claimed that he was a spy who had worked for India’s external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) since 2013. The Pakistani narrative has always held that he is an active naval officer, a claim that appears false because of two things. First, India would not send a serving naval officer as an undercover agent to Iran. Second, if the officer was serving and had been posted to Chahbahar in uniform he would have diplomatic cover. Meanwhile, on December 25 last year, Iranian Parliament speaker Ali Larijani (a Shia country that the Sunni Pakistan is frantically trying to become close to), while addressing a news conference in Islamabad after attending a six-nation anti-terror conference in Islamabad, said: “Kulbhushan was doing business in Chahbahar and we had no information about him being a spy. The security institutions of both countries (Pakistan and Iran) had already exchanged information in this regard.” It is time for India to call Pakistan’s bluff and continue to work with the international community and increase pressure through the ICJ to get consular access to Jadhav. India must make all efforts to ensure that Jadhav is brought back to India alive. That would be a fitting honour for a former naval officer and an Indian national who deserves better than being a pawn in Pakistani hands.",2018-01-03,"ISI,LeT,Pakistan,Kulbhushan Jadhav",How ISI choreographed Kulbhushan Jadhav's meeting with family to humiliate India,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kulbhushan-jadhav-wife-mother-meeting-mea-pakistan-let-isi/story/1/21526.html
587,Romita Datta,"She had once called her ""Ma/Jangalmahal er Ma"" (mother, mother of Jangal Mahal). And the mother very often would tell others what a good girl she was. Often this mutual admiration would be on the dais of political rallies and government programmes in full public view. This was in 2011 and it continued for seven years as the mother's ""bhalo meye"" - or the good girl - obediently and with the right dosage of obeisance was toeing her line, fulfilling all her wishes and definitely becoming indispensable to her. The daughter in question is Bharati Ghosh, former SP of West Midnapore, and the mother is none other than Mamata Banerjee. Bharati, who was part of a UN peacekeeping mission for years and a former management student of Harvard, came to Bengal in 2011 and drew Mamata's attention after the latter took over as the chief minister of the state. From the state CID, she was made the SP of West Midnapore, which witnessed Maoist violence after 2008. Bharati, with her vast experience in war-torn places of Kosovo and Bosnia, was thought fit to tackle the Maoists. Like an efficient cop, she decimated the Maoists and was responsible for the death of their leader, Koteswar Rao, in a severe gun-battle. The other prominent Maoists operating in that area, and responsible for death of jawans in police camps, were wooed over with handsome packages, and the young turks who dreamt of a classless revolution were won over in the fold of the ruling party with posts, power and privileges. The backward areas of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore became free of not just the Maoist menace but of any dissenting voices. The districts surrendered and Mamata compensated with heavy doses of development, plugging all possibilities of a Maoist regrouping. And all this was largely possible because of Bharati Ghosh, who dared to be deadly different. Gradually, Bharati gained Mamata's confidence and according to the Opposition, she was less of a police officer and more of a party functionary. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and in the 2016 Assembly polls, Bharati  . She was transferred by the EC from the SP's post for allegedly intimidating poll officers and overstepping her jurisdiction. In 2016, she was reprimanded for exceeding her brief and meeting political persons, especially Mukul Roy, then second-in-command of the Trinamool Congress, while model code of conduct was in place. The rap from the EC had no effect on Bharati as Mamata awarded her with prized posting, more power and punch, and greater responsibility. As Bharati went on antagonising Mamata's enemies, she scored brownie points in her career, obviously gaining in the confidence of the chief minister. But finally what soured the relation was Mukul Roy leaving the Trinamool Congress and joining the BJP. Bharati, known to be close and loyal to Roy, became a prime suspect in the eyes of the chief minister. As Roy started consolidating the base of the BJP in the Jungle Mahal area, there were rumours that Bharati was using her clout and muscle power to help him make deep inroads. The final nail in the coffin was the result of the by-election in Sabang in West Midnapore district. Though the Trinamool Congress won with a huge margin of over 67,000 votes and BJP came third, the latter increased its vote share by 17 per cent and that was enough to keep tongues wagging. The Congress-turned-Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP, Manas Bhuniya, who hailed from Sabang and was a strong critique of Bharati Ghosh since the time he was in the Opposition as a Congress MLA, saw this as an opportunity to turn Mamata against her ""good girl"". There were allegations from the district intelligence office that Bharati had held meetings with BJP leaders and was helping them improve their vote share. Logically, Bharati stood to gain by siding with the BJP. Mamata also had a hunch that Bharati would prefer to work for the party at the Centre given her ambition and career prospects. Immediately after the Sabang by-election results came out, Bharati was removed to an insignificant post as an officer of State Armed Police in Barrackpore. But Bharati   to the DG of police. While the resignation will help her think clearly on what should be the next step, it will also free her of her commitments to the service rules. She is threatening to open her mouth and settle scores. To swallow her resignation would mean handing over an ammo to BJP, since Bharati by virtue of being close to the ruling Trinamool Congress shared many secrets, especially the ones that the ""mother-daughter"" duo exchanged. Mamata has initiated an internal investigation against Bharati Ghosh to ensure she keeps mum, but given the stubborn daughter she is, Bharati might not buckle. Taking up the challenge of a duel, Bharati has also retorted saying that she too has a tale to tell.

588,Kamlesh Sutar,"The usually peaceful celebrations at the Bhima Koregaon village every year to commemorate the battle of 1818, took an unusually   on January 1. The history of 200 years is seen as a metaphor of Dalit triumph against the caste-based tyranny during the Peshwa rule. The violence in Pune on Monday resulted in the death of one and vandalising of several vehicles that were stranded on the Pune highway for hours. Violent reactions were also reported from Aurangabad and other parts of the state. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and the Congress have alleged the role of right-wing organisations in the violence, calling it a pre-meditated attack. The violence and the subsequent political reactions though are obvious. The root cause of the incident can be traced to the interpretation of Maratha history. Broadly speaking there are two school of thoughts that decipher the Maratha history. A section of historians have portrayed Shivaji as a Hindutva icon who fought the Islamic aggression of Mughals. Another section, mostly Dalit historians, believes that Shivaji was a ""Bahujan"" ruler who was subjected to humiliation by the upper caste Brahmins. The right-wing portrayal of Shivaji is that of ""Hindavi Swarajya Sansthapak"" (the founder of Hindu kingdom), and ""Gau-Brahman prati palak"" (the protector of cows and Brahmins) while the other section call Shivaji as ""Rayate cha Raja"" (king of the ryots). 
 
 Shivaji's kingdom after his death was caught in a family feud and was further handled by the Peshwas, who were upper caste Brahmins and the prime minister in Shivaji's cabinet. After achieving glory during Peshwa Bajirao I's rule (where the Peshwas extended their rule beyond Attock, now in Pakistan) the Peshwa rule became notorious for its Casteist rule. The Peshwa rule or Peshwai, as it was called, came to an end in 1818, mainly after the battle of Bhima Koregaon. A small battalion of the British East India company, mostly comprising soldiers belonging to the Mahar caste fought the mighty army of 28,000 Peshwa soldiers. The Bhima Koregaon battle, more than a fight of supremacy, has been seen as a symbol of uprising against the Peshwa tyranny against lower castes. Ever since, the interpretation of history has not only been at the centre of academic debate, but also a boiling socio-political issue. Although there has been undercurrents in Maharashtra's political circle, lately after the BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis (a Brahmin) has come to power, agitations with historic connotations are on the rise. Immediately after the BJP came to power, Fadnavis was at the receiving end for conferring the state's highest Maharashtra Bhushan award to historian  . Maratha organisations for years have alleged that Purandare was responsible for the Brahmanisation of Maratha history. In 2004, Pune's Bhandarkar Institute was vandalised by Maratha organisations alleging that American researcher James Laine had portrayed Shivaji and his mother in bad light. This has led to the banning of the book. But since then, Maratha organisations suc as Sambhaji Brigade and Maratha Mahasangh have been at the forefront of aggressive Maratha agenda. So in 2014, when a Brahmin Devendra Fadnavis became the chief minister, it was likened to the rule of Peshwa. Similarly like the Purandare episode, Maratha organisations uprooted a statue of renowned  from Pune's Sambhaji Park. The allegation was yet again the same, wrong portrayal of Sambhaji through a Brahminical prism. The Brahmin versus Maratha socio-political conflict had a third angle of the Dalits. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar calling for annihilation of caste burnt the copies of Manu Smriti. Anti-Brahmin tone has been the main ingredient of the Maratha and Dalit movements. Although the struggle was targeted at Brahmnin upper caste hegemony, clashes have been noted only between the Marathas and Dalits. Violence between Brahmins and Dalits, or Brahmins and Marathas have hardly been noted. Although the Brahmin community remains a meagre three per cent of the state's population and politically uninfluential in Maharashtra (unlike Uttar Pradesh), they still have been at the centre stage of such agitations. Maratha organisations took to the streets after a girl from the community was raped and murdered in Kopardi. There were mammoth rallies by the community to demand justice for the victim and also reservation for the community. The massive Maratha morchas also had an undertone of anti-Dalit sentiment as the accused in the case were  . The Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence and bitterness in the 1980s when former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University. The latest incident is yet another case of the strange history of clashes - while the Mahar battalion fought an army of Peshwas, the latest clashes have been reported between Marathas and Dalits. The violence will undoubtedly have its own political ramifications. But it has once again brought to the fore the complex caste cauldron in Maharashtra politics.  ",2018-01-02,"Devendra Fadnavis,BJP,Dalits,Maharashtra",How Bhima Koregaon battle anniversary turned into a riot,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-protests-dalits-killed-maharashtra-bjp-devendra-fadnavis-caste-politics/story/1/21500.html
589,Aninda Dey,"Donald Trump may have forced   to cringe in his grave. The swashbuckling, swaggering playboy-US Congressman from Texas and   were brothers in arms literally - Pakistan was the conduit for channelling Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, who finally started shooting down the lethal, much-feared Soviet Hind copters (Mi-24s) - or ""Shaitan-Arba"" (Satan’s Chariot) - with pinpoint accuracy in Afghanistan. As more planeloads of Stingers and other weapons landed in Pakistan, Wilson and Zia bonded closer. “Yes, Charlie did it,” remarked Zia after the Soviets met their Waterloo and made an ignominious exit. While Wilson loved Pakistan, he hated India. His hatred was evident when he dubbed India hypocritical and a satellite of the erstwhile Soviet Union in an interview with the Associated Press in 2003. “My general experience of Indians is that they are rather arrogant, know a lot more than anyone else about most things and are stiff-necked. Just like the Americans. But I noticed that they changed very quickly once the Soviets collapsed.” However, the Faustian pact the US had struck with the dreaded Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to counter the Soviets continued as Zia bled J&K under Operation Topaz with Uncle Sam turning a blind eye. The devilish deal would come back to haunt the US with Wilson’s rampaging ""Frankenstein"" in Afghanistan transforming itself into Godzilla - the very Mujahideen mutated into the Taliban and the ISI, under its rugged and foxy director Hamid Gul, nurtured the Taliban with Saudi money.   Washington continued to nurture the relationship with Pakistan and billions of dollars in aid flowed into the country. From 2002 to 2016, the US has provided more than $14 billion in aid to Pakistan with the highest assistance of $2,100 million in 2011 - the same year in which al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was hunted down by the Navy Seal Team Six in a house close to Pakistan’s military academy in Abbottabad. The Afghan abyss still stares at the US. Trump blocking $255-million in military aid to Pakistan is perhaps the biggest jolt for Islamabad after Operation Neptune Spear in Abbottabad. Despite billions of dollars of aid, Pakistan and the ISI has been helping the Taliban, the Haqqani network, LeT and JeM. With the Islamic State (IS) entering Afghanistan, America faces a two-headed snake. Although the US has not given the specific reason for the aid blockade, Trump’s Afghanistan policy - which targeted Pakistan for not doing enough to rein in terrorists - and the threat from the IS and the LeT seem to have prompted the president.      As the IS is rapidly losing ground in Iraq and Syria, Afghanistan could be its next bastion. The threat of IS plotting attacks on the US in Afghanistan looms large. According to the New America Foundation, there have been several IS-inspired attacks on US soil. The IS had claimed responsibility for the attack on an exhibition of Prophet Muhammad cartoons in Garland, Texas, in 2015. In the first IS-inspired attack on US, the two attackers had been in touch with an online recruiter for the terror outfit. In the latest IS-inspired attack in October 2017, Uzbek   Sayfullo Saipov rammed a rented truck into pedestrians and cyclists near the World Trade Center, killing eight. In the worst terrorist attack since 9/11, the IS claimed responsibility for the Orlando gay nightclub attack in which   shot dead 50 people. Although the LeT primarily focusses on India, it poses threat to the US as well. Times Square bomber   was trained by the LeT in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. Way back in 2013, Jonah Blank, senior political scientists at RAND Corporation, had raised the possibility of a 26/11-like attack in the US. She told the Committee on Homeland Security, “A Mumbai-style attack - that is, an attack dramatic and shocking enough to inspire widespread terror even without the use of weapons of mass destruction or a casualty-count in the thousands - remains a realistic near-term threat to the homeland. Such an attack might be termed, ""Boston Squared"" - that is, an attack similar to the   in April, but much larger in effect.” Stressing the LeT’s capability, experience and resourcefulness, Blank said the terror outfit had “enjoyed virtually open support from the Pakistani state throughout the 1990s, and has received at least tacit protection from Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate since the group was officially banned by Islamabad in 2002”. Top al Qaeda commander Abu Zubaydah was captured in Faisalabad, Pakistan in 2002, in an LeT safe house. “Lashkar-e Taiba is a de facto affiliate of al Qaeda, and is believed to have joined Osama bin Laden's International Islamic Front for jihad sometime after the umbrella group's famous fatwa in 1998,” Blank added. Trump is riled by the continued ISI support to the Taliban and the Haqqani network, which has been frustrating US efforts to come out of the Afghan imbroglio. After more than 15 years and thousands of casualties, the US has failed to beat the battle-hardened Taliban, which now hold sway over 60 per cent of Afghanistan. ",2018-01-02,"Charlie Wilson,Zia-ul-haq,Pakistan,Donald Trump",Trump blocking $255-mn aid is perhaps the biggest jolt to Pakistan after Abbottabad raid,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/trump-pakistan-zia-charlie-wilson-osama-bin-laden-abbottabad-isi/story/1/21507.html
590,Anand Balasubramanian,"Actor Rajinikanth has launched a  as a quick follow-up to his big announcement of entering politics on December 31, 2017.  Leaving aside the fact that the website is as basic as it comes and looks cluttered, how far will this be helpful in taking his political career forward with the recruitment of new members is the real question. 
 
 Online recruitment is not new in Indian politics. The Congress has an online membership form through which you can become a member of the party without visiting any of its offices. All you need is a copy of your voter ID card. The BJP takes this a step further and gives you an option between becoming a member and online aficionado of the party with portal user-only access. In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK and the DMK too allow online enrolment into the party. When it comes to reaching out to their followers, almost all big names have mobile apps. Even new entrants who are yet to launch their parties such as actors Kamal Haasan and Vishal have launched their own apps to connect with the people. While these apps and website will definitely be useful, will it really be a key player in inviting new members into the party? Well, yes. It will attract the current generation who are perpetually glued to their phone screens to join the party or their cause. The only issue is, how to convert these members into actual votes. When one had to visit an office, fill out a form and pay a membership fee, the person joining the party would have to have the intention and the will to join for him to put in that effort. If you belong to the left-wing political parties, you are expected to share a portion of your monthly purse with the party. You will be forced to make a conscious decision of following the ideology of the party and going out of your way before joining it. Even though this is not foolproof, it will at the very least ensure that the person who joins your party has the will to vote for you at the time of contributing to your vote share in the constituency.   When all you have to do is fill up four to five fields in an online form to join a party, you will not only attract the “why not” crowd, but also the mischievous, if not malicious elements. This could lead to embarrassing situations in the future since the party leadership would be answerable for their actions. It would also end up inflating the party numbers and giving false hope to the party leadership. Another question that the party needs to ask itself is if the numbers generated from online membership actually translate into votes in its favour. But make no mistake about it, apps and websites are absolutely essential in today’s age. It will help the party and the leader keep his cadre engaged. Providing an app to existing party members where they would need their party ID to login would help them keep their base consolidated. It will also keep them apprised of the party’s current stand on important issues, rally them for protests and even help them provide effective feedback to the party leadership on the local issues. However, the effectiveness of online recruitment of party members is something that is untested and may prove to be ineffective for a start-up party. If Rajinikanth plans to convert these members directly into party cadre en masse, he would have to be wary of the pitfalls that would ensue with the strategy. For, people who probably do not want to see Rajinikanth in politics, can use the website/app to infiltrate into the party and corrupt his base and image altogether. That is one danger the existing parties with consolidated base which use the app or website for communication is safe from.  ",2018-01-02,"Website,Mobile app,Politics,Rajinikanth",Should Rajinikanth's digital drive worry his political opponents?,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajinikanth-political-party-online-recruitment-android-mobile-app-website/story/1/21509.html
591,Manoj Joshi,"When it comes to the Modi government’s foreign policy record, you can see it as a glass half full or a glass half empty. Full or empty, it was half. It did not meet its full potential and there were more misses than hits, especially in the neighbourhood, in 2017. But there was one significant achievement which has made up for this and has important portents for the future. This was facing down Beijing over Doklam which was done with verve and sophistication. So what could 2018 bring? Perhaps its most important motif will be balance. Having stepped out in significant directions in 2015 and 2016 towards the US and Israel, Modi will seek to restore some equilibrium. He will seek to repair ties with China and reach out to Palestine, to signal to the Arab world that Indian policy is not changing. Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanhayu is to visit India in mid-January for the Raisina Dialogue, but that is more about ideological signaling rather than achieving any major foreign policy goal. India is not a player in the Middle East, its primary interest is the stability of this vital region and it would be well advised to maintain its traditional posture of balancing between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iran. With the Saudi-Israel entente growing, there could be an argument for a slight tilt in the Iranian direction, else we may see a repeat of a situation where external pressures pushed our ally Russia into the arms of China. Note that Modi’s initiatives in the Gulf sheikhdoms are now paying. Following Modi’s visit in early 2017, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has invested nearly $3 billion (Rs 19,000 crore)in a range of areas relating to infrastructure and renewable energy. And this, say Indian diplomats in the region, is only the beginning. In 2018, significant developments could also take place in southeast Asia, beginning with the Indo-ASEAN commemorative summit on January, followed by New Delhi hosting all the ASEAN leaders collectively as chief guests at the Republic Day function. Modi’s expected speech at the Shangrila Dialogue in Singapore in early June will be important because it is being delivered at Asia’s premier security meet. This could be a harbinger of deepening Indian commitments in the region to balance China’s activism in South Asia. Having faced down Beijing in Doklam, India is in a good position to engage Beijing. Not much will come from this because issues between the two are not open to quick resolution. In recent years, they have displayed a dangerous tendency not to respond to the numerous CBMs that have kept peace between the two countries in recent decades. We now need newer mechanisms simply to ensure things do not get out of hand. If things go well, we could well see an acceleration of the steadily increasing Chinese investments in India topped off by a visit by Chinese supremo, Xi Jinping. The Chinese understand well that India is a huge opportunity for them. We could well see a negotiated settlement of the Sino-Indian impasse over the Belt and Road Initiative. It is in the context of China that India also needs to pay attention to Russia in 2018. There has been significant activity on the official front in 2017, but a visit by President Putin for the annual consultative summit could restore some vitality to the relationship. Our most important tie will remain the one with the US. It will also be the most problematic. It has so far been Washington’s best managed foreign relationship, but it could rub up against Indian interests relating to Iran and Russia. However, there is every indication that the US is willing to give New Delhi considerable leeway here because its need for India’s weight in the “Indo Pacific” region is significant. And what about Pakistan? There is unlikely to be much of a shift here, considering Pakistan has no real government at present and, perhaps, more important, it remains a useful electoral tool for Modi. He is also likely to visit Davos for the World Economic Forum summit. At first sight, it looks like an attempt to catch up with Jinping who was the chief guest last year. Symbolic attendance at Davos won’t change things. The economy is not going anywhere for a while and Modi must take the blame for that. New Delhi does appear to be in a sweet spot of sorts because of American friction with Pakistan and China. This could grow, for differing reasons, in 2018. This can provide sufficient space to further India’s interests. This is where the rub comes in. It is now widely accepted that Indian economy slowed down on account of self-inflicted wounds in 2017. Hopefully, Modi and his team will not do a repeat in the arena of foreign policy.
