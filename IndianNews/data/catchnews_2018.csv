BJP has fielded former CM B.S Yeddyurappa’s son in the Shimoga constituency. BJP has earlier said that they are confident of winning 3 seats out of the 5 seats which went to poll and the Congress-JDS are defined to win 4 out of the 5, which is sign of popularity votes for the existing alliance. According to the numbers released by the Election Commission immediately after polling ended, the turnout was 61.05 per cent in Shivamogga, 63.85 per cent in Ballari and 53.93 per cent in Mandya Lok Sabha constituencies.

Hiphei submitted the resignation to the Deputy Speaker R Lalrinawma and it was later on accepted. On Sunday, a BJP leader had already claimed that Hiphei would resign from the grand old party and he would join the BJP in a day or two. The PTI quoted the BJP leader, saying “He (Hiphei) would first tender his resignation as the speaker and then from the primary membership of the Congress. He will then join our party.” Mizoram is the lone state of the north-east where the Congress party is in power and the BJP’s North-East Democratic Alliance has been able to garner yet another leader of the Opposition. The Mizoram election would be a direct contest between the Congress and the BJP and former Congress leader and in-charge of BJP’s election strategy of the north-east, Himanta Biswa Sarma has been actively spearheading the NEDA’s alliance in the seven sisters of the east.

The Sara Ali Khan and Sushant Singh Rajput starrer Kedarnath is facing criticism from BJP for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. A senior BJP leader has writting to Censor Board, sking the film ‘Kedarnath’ to be banned, claiming that it hurts Hindu sentiments and also promotes love jihad. The film 'Kedarnath' is based on the Uttrakhand flood disaster of 2013 that wiped out settlements and decimated lives. On Saturday, Ajendra Ajay, who is a member of Uttarakhand BJP’s media relations team, wrote to Central Board of Film Certification Chairman Prasoon Joshi, alleging that even though the Abhishek Kapoor-directed movie was based on one of the worst human tragedies, it made fun of Hindu sentiments. The BJP leader also objected to a kissing scene between the film’s two protagonists - played by Singh and Khan - in the film’s teaser as well as the tagline of the movie’s poster which says “Love is a pilgrimage.” Ajay claimed that the movie was an attack on the Hindu religion because Kedarnath shrine was a symbol of the faith of crores of Hindus. Speaking to PTI, Ajay said, ""By setting a romantic love story against the backdrop of a huge tragedy that occurred at Kedarnath, a centre of faith for crores of Hindus, the filmmakers have shown great disrespect to the followers of the religion.” The BJP leader also took exception to the film showcasing the love story between a Muslim porter and a Hindi pilgrim, questioning why the filmmakers couldn’t find a Hindu character for the lead. He accused the movie of promoting love jihad, stating that the film showed Kedarnath in a flippant manner, thus triggering “acute resentment among teertha purohits.” Ajay urged CBFC chief to impose a ban on the movie, movie produced by Ronnie Screwwala and Pragya Kapoor, warning that the film’s release could result in large-scale protests.",2018-11-11,"kedarnath tragedy,Kedarnath film,kedarnath film controversy,Sarkar,Sara Ali Khan,Sushant Singh Rajput,Prasoon Joshi,Censor Board"," BJP demands 'ban' on Sushant Singh Rajput, Sara Ali Khan starrer Kedarnath for this shocking reason! | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/bollywood-news/bjp-demands-ban-on-sushant-singh-rajput-sara-ali-khan-starrer-kedarnath-for-this-shocking-reason-139833.html

There are 198 booths which are relocated and about 1 lakh security personnel have been deployed over the 18 constituencies, to look into the safety of the officers and voters. The first assembly of the Chhattisgarh, formed in 2000, was constituted on the basis of the Madhya Pradesh state legislative assembly elections held in 1998, in which the Congress party had won 172 seats and the BJP 119 seats out of the 320 seats. The state was then divided into Chhattisgarh and 90 Assembly seats went to the newly formed state and the rest 230 remained with MP.   Thereafter the division, Congress leader Ajit Jogi was made the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh, with Congress bagging 48 seats and BJP contented with 38, Others received 4. In the first assembly election held in the state in 2003, the Bhartiya Janta Party had turned the tables and the Maoists infested state overturned the ruling Congress with the BJP winning 50 seats and Congress was brought down to 37. Dr. Raman Singh, the architect of the BJP in the state was chosen to be the chief minister by then Prime Minister Late Atal Bihari Vajpayee. As per the latest information, in today’s Assembly Election, the voting percentage has been 47.18% till 3pm in the first phase of Maoists infested region. In the 2013 Assembly polls, the first phase of the elections in the Naxal-affected areas of Bastar, where the 18 constituencies went to poll was 75.53% and the second phase, which includes other 72 seats, saw 74.7% polling. The state had seen a voter turnout of 71.09% in the 2008 Assembly Election, and the record voter turnout was in 2013. Every Assembly election, held since 2003, has been single handedly won by the ruling BJP and Raman Singh completed his hat-trick in 2013. In 2008 Assembly election, the BJP had won 50 seats and the Congress 38. A new player came into existence with a considerable voter share of 6.11% and it was Bahujan Samaj Party, led by  , which won 2 seats in the state. Former CM and Congress leader Ajit Jogi, who was once the backbone of the grand-old party, was expelled along with his son Amit Jogi from the party due to anti-party activities and sabotaging the bypoll in Antagarh. Thereafter, the father-son duo formed their own outfit named Chhattisgarh Janta Congress (CJC) in 2016 and challenged the incumbent CM Rman Singh. In the 2018 Assembly election, Ajit Jogi, formed an alliance with Mayawati’s   to oust the BJP from the state. Jogi had said that he will be the CM candidate and Mayawati will be the PM candidate for the upcoming polls in the state and general election.

The population of the Scheduled Castes has increased from 11.6% in 2001 to 12.8% in 2011, as per the Census.

Kushwaha even issued a statement which raised the eyebrows of the BJP high command, and hence the latter has a contingency plan for the upcoming election, in case Kushwaha spilts with the RJD. Kushwaha had earlier said that “I say it with utmost sense of responsibility that there some in the NDA who do not want to see   as the PM (second time).

51,Shriya Bhasin,"The strategy of mixing politics with religion generally comes at the expense of secularism, tolerance and vulnerable minorities and ths riptide is generally the agenda of our dear Prime Minister, Mr.   and his Bhartiya Janata Party.  It seems as if Hindutva is the card for the ruling party and embracing it by glorifying the religion, the cow, banning of beef, putting a stop to cow slaughtering is their major concern while poor economic growth, decline in the number of jobs, fluctuating market, soaring rise in the fuel price etc is something which goes side by side.  But the question here arises- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER COMMUNITIES? Here is an open letter from an Indian who happens to be a Muslim and wants the Prime Minister to know how his politics of religion affects him and his life. ALSO READ:  “Dear Mr Prime Minister, Namaste, Aadaab! The wise should work without attachment (Nishkaam Karma), for the welfare of the society - The Bhagavad Gita As we start another year on a cautiously positive note for our loved ones and our great country, I thought of sharing some assorted thoughts with you. These somewhat seemingly disparate notions are linked by a deep love for the civilisation called India and a belief that constructive criticism is an example of tough love and not self-loathing. It is this love that motivates us to make things better, by identifying the flaws rather than sweeping them under the carpet. I belong to Lucknow (am originally from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh, but have lived most of my life in Lucknow), the epitome of the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb. My first window to the outside world was the newspaper, perhaps justifiably delivered by a Panditji (read the Hindu learned man). Our house lay behind a building owned by a Jain family. The first sounds that broke the silence of the early morning hours were the azaan from nearby mosques, followed by bhajans, played out at a police post across the street. My father's best friend was Mr AN Singh. No Eid was complete without Singh uncle's visit. He even managed one such trip during a curfew relaxation, as the Ayodhya dispute engulfed north India. At Diwali, our refrigerator struggled to accommodate the boxes of sweets gifted to my father. The Holi procession passed through our street, and as boisterous children, we enjoyed the colourful sight with elders who had no qualms about getting a tilak from celebrants. At school, we took equal pride in reading about the exploits of Rani Laxmi Bai and Havildar Abdul Hameed. My parents had no issue with the singing of Vande Mataram during assemblies. Bhasha Bhaskar, my Hindi textbook, introduced me to the fascinating world of Hindu mythology. Each episode of the Hindu epics - Ramayana, and later Mahabharata - that was shown by our state broadcaster Doordarshan, was eagerly awaited by my family. I saw them as part of our shared heritage as Indians. But sir, something changed in 2014. I was made aware of my Muslim identity more than ever, though there is nothing in my attire and attitude that sets me apart. Religion to me has always been a private affair. Sadly, it seems that even secular voices like mine are fast becoming an object of ridicule in the name of chauvinistic nationalism (which I see as opposed to enlightened patriotism). I know what it is like to be a minority but this surcharged environment is an acutely distressing experience for me. Mr Prime Minister, you represent the whole of India, even the 69 per cent who did not vote for your party. As a tax-paying, law-abiding citizen of India, I have every right to question governance when I feel disconcerted or threatened. Isn’t it something that the Constitution guarantees me? As the past has shown, even the Grand Old Party of India was shown the door when it became complacent. Your remedy against corruption resonated with those who voted for you. It was a decisive mandate to turn things around. Unfortunately, many of your party workers took this as an opportunity to avenge the Muslim appeasement that happened under previous governments. Since then a counter-narrative has been created, with a measure of success, in order to bring Hindus under one umbrella. This “Us versus Them” psychosis will only make matters worse. As world events have shown, dividing people into specific groups inevitably leads to divided lands. Hate crimes are on the rise in our country. According to IndiaSpend, India's first data journalism initiative, 11 deaths resulting from cow-related hate crimes have been reported in 2017. This is the highest since 2010 and the minorities have been at the receiving end mostly. An Indian killing another Indian, driven by an extreme view of his faith, should be a cause of worry for us all. Since the 2019 general elections are not far away, it is time for you to take a clear and unequivocal stand. Good governance (or a certain interpretation of the term) is not for a privileged few as it seems to be becoming. In our national interest - please do not let the fringe become the new norm. I leave you with this quote from Mahatma Gandhi: “The conception of my patriotism is nothing if it is not always, in every case without exception, consistent with the broadest good of humanity at large. Not only that, but my religion and my patriotism derived from my religion embrace all life.” Sincerely, Inam Abidi Amrohvi” (The views in the letter, expressed by the writer are personal.)",2018-10-27,"Narendra Modi,Modi government,Indian economy,Politics of religion,Muslim Vote Bank,Muslims in Modi government,Lok Sabha elections,Lok Sabha elections 2019,Rupee vs Dollar,#whereisthechange"," Mr. Narendra Modi, here’s an open letter to you and your government asking you to stop this politics of religion | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/mr-narendra-modi-here-s-an-open-letter-to-you-and-your-government-asking-you-to-stop-this-politics-of-religion-138547.html

62,Speed News Desk,"The grand Statue Of Unity, made in the honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, on his 143rd birth anniversary  was inaugrated by the Prime Minister of our country   on October 31, 2018. The building made on the budget of approximately Rs 2,989 crore represents the symbolic unification of India after its Independence. The statue has now become the world’s tallest one with the height of 182 metres (597 feet) but the question hear arises was it necessary? How would Sardar Patel would have reacted on the same. Here’s an open letter from one of the famous social activists of our country, Medha Patkar that will definitely open your eyes.   Respected Sardar Patelji, Namaskar! Wherever you may be, as our leader of the Freedom Movement, your soul, I know, rests here on the motherland whose beloved son you have always been. Your act of freeing India from the shackles of royal states and estates and of freeing the farmers from the oppressive tax laws of the British regime is unprecedented even to this day. As the first home minister of the first government of Independent India, your firm, non-communal and social approach to the unparalleled violence and the relief work thereafter, was appreciated by none else than Mahatmaji as unique, despite the controversy created by some. ALSO READ:  You stood tall in the historical freedom struggle of India as Sardar. But you know, while throwing your legacy by the way side, a 182 meter-high statue of yours is being unveiled in a few days to be the tallest in the world! Can you imagine who has built your new avatar? Many Chinese and some local Adivasi and national labourers have worked overnight on the ‘Sadhu Bet’, a hillock with Adivasi deity of their faith. You would surely ask, on whose land would this statue stand? Whose plan was this? This land, river, forest that your avatar is going to stand on, belongs to Adivasis. The very same people your government and then leaders, Mahatma to Pandit Nehru recognised as villagers with rights, as republics and offered security through Panchsheel. The forefathers of the Indian Constitution, with Babasaheb at the helm, also granted them right to peace and good government, through the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and later, the PESA Act towards self-reliance. You would surely watch from the highland, the scene down into the River Narmada and its banks to the basin wide and far. Your vision will find their huts and hamlets in the hills and hillocks one of which was Varata Bawa Tekri under your feet. Do remember the days when you carried out the operation to integrate the princely states with delicacy and democracy, to make most of them sacrifice voluntarily for unity. By the way, your avatar is also claimed to be for the same goal, unity…yet with the insanity of impinging upon not just their land but also their rights. Would you ever think of using ‘force’ against these simple and least monetised, self-reliant people, as had to be done against the princely state of Junagadh then? Sardar, these Adivasis also belong to the farming community you recognised as the contributors who feed and need to lead. Today, if only you know the reasons behind their laying life and cuddling death, you would have taken to the same task and struggle, combing villages and fields as in August 1942. But the most shocking for you, who acquired royal properties, dealt with transfers, created ‘privy purses,’ would be to know the ways and means of transferring today the life supporting resources of the very brethren you fought for, receiving acclaim for the social movement you built. Non-cooperation was the non-violent tool you exercised, under the guidance of Bapu then. ALSO READ:  The same tool is now a weapon in the hands of the Indian rulers, practising neo-colonial ideals. They do not bring in the horses or the Sepoys or take over properties of the rich and the mighty. They take over the very life line: land, water, river, forest and fish of the weak and the marginalised. Could you ever dream of the Indian State – the ICS cadres who you were treated as the ‘Patron Saint’ of, and the cabinet members, you warned against ‘partiality and corruptibility’ and incited against a path of rectitude in your speech on April 21, 1947 – assuming itself to be powerful enough to not only tax farmers but also exploit them through low prices for the produce and extract GST from small traders and evict the market infrastructure of the poor, the hawkers, in the name of huge, gigantic infrastructure? Is your legacy at stake, Sardar? How could they tolerate suicides by lakhs of farmers? ALSO READ:  Do please have a look on your left and you will find the six-lane highway running up to 120 km in length parallel to Narmada. Lakhs of trees, more than 100-years-old, within the last year had to make way for this highway. People of Rajpipla, once a princely state that is recorded in history for having defeated Aurangzeb’s forces are compelled to be mute spectators, having no channel to vent their Mann ki Baat. You, Sardar, once the chairman of the committees responsible for minorities, tribals, excluded areas and fundamental rights must also know that when your avatar will be well lit and decorated, the tribal communities, being repressed and oppressed, are to be thrown into darkness. Their lands, in six villages not even legally acquired, following British law of 1894, but simply taken over, paying a paltry sum of Rs 80 to Rs 200 per acre in 1961, are now being diverted for luxurious hotels named after ‘Shreshtha Bharath’ or Swaminarayan Complex and even a museum with their own remnants. You, who were successful in recovering the farmlands for the farmers refusing to pay the oppressive tax would come down to support these tribals who are not granted anything as per the new law of 2013, nor are gifted with alternative land but are being made to accept a Rs 7 lakh package which they too are non-cooperating with. You were at the forefront of such a struggle and having threatened to leave Congress, had made your party accept the path of non-violent yet militant battle that led you into jail in 1940 and a solid mass protest in 1942, with shutdown of none less than civil services! With your ability to organise the countrymen as also to face the onslaught of the imperialist forces, you could certainly challenge the present powers, the creators of your avatar, vouching for unity, but practising divide and rule tactics and promoting or allowing brutality, while denying diversity of creed, culture and religion. If only you would take a step forward and downward into the valley of Narmada, you would surely be overwhelmed with the simplicity of these nature-based generations-old communities, of Adivasis, farmers and fishworkers. Many of them had already lost their lands as it was acquired by the state for the Dam, again in your name, Sardar Sarovar, without paying them compensation worth a rupee. They too walked in your steps, faced attacks, and were sent to jails. (Jail? You had called it a ‘place for peace’, in 1943, remember?) The government in 2013 issued orders and made promises to give land for land. But ultimately they are being cheated and evicted out of their balance land for tourism! Do please have an eye on these fast track operations around, as only you can stop them from further damage…only you can! Sardar, the scale and impact of forcible encroachment upon the lives of the communities in this most ancient Narmada civilisation and the valley, can be seen by someone of your stature and perspective. No one can hold your hand today, but you could and would drag the sena/army of bureaucrats out of their villages with your ‘iron hand’ if only you witnessed their might against the toilers’ rights. Will you, our beloved leader, engage the powers that be in a thorough review and reflection? Gone are the days when yourself and Gandhiji had such a discourse on the floor of the jail and evolved a vision of swaraj and self-reliance, of agriculture and village republics. Gone are the days when you valued production by masses to ensure equity in both the economy and the social life. I feel ashamed to tell you that there was no need to bring in 1,500 Chinese workers here while excluding local adivasis from Gujarat, your own state, many of whom are compelled to migrate and harvest sugarcane, working day and night. I feel shaken to share with you what is being planned and publicised in your name… Shopping malls, five or seven star hotels, luxurious guest houses, helipads, statewise bhavans on the river bank with all its paraphernalia the shops, markets, massive food plaza, food courts, walk ways, travelators and what not. All this when not less than 35,000 families, affected by the Dam in your name since years, are still awaiting full, fair and just rehabilitation.  They never marketised Narmada, nor its water. They are damned by the Dam but are most awed and anguished to see their sacrifice being taken as a capital for the tourism industry and as everyone knows, political tourism too. They are sad that the farmers of Gujarat, the progeny of your movements are left high and dry… while the corporates reap huge benefits. Your contribution to the farmers and vision of India are enshrined with that of Mahatmaji and Nehru in all our memories. You accepted Panditji, and vowed for unity within Congress. The common citizens of this country have no place in this gigantic play today, Sardar. All lights will be on you, the avatar, Sardar, while throwing everything that you practised and preached is intentionally left to the dark recesses of history books and the future of the Adivasis and this country is being sealed with the new paradigm. Your generation was aware of two vices – corruption and communalism. The spirit behind your then sermons is needed today. Your NO to communalism reflected in your appeal to the religious leaders during communal violence following the partition that was inevitable. Your speeches across India and a letter to Golwalkar Guruji against the Hindu fundamentalist vision of RSS asking them to change and get integrated, is to be read and imbibed by every citizen of the country today. Those who are hiding behind your new Avatar, and marketing you, have never engaged themselves to understand your thoughts and your action to over come violence, to move from monarchies to democracy, from monopoly and hegemony to equity and fraternity. They do not visit the families of those lynched by mobs. They do not respect the resolutions of the adivasis. They do not value agriculture or the agriculturists.  But they are staking a claim to your name, Sardar. They hail the tallness of your Avatar while they are consumed in their own pettiness. Adivasis know all this. Evicted since 1961, the Adivasis can’t take it anymore. No Jaykaras ! No celebrations from them. They mourn, they protest, they condemn and challenge as they know their mother river, not just gods and goddesses but culture and nature, and their very life is threatened again and again. Their forefathers too had fought the British, and with their perseverance had held on to land then. They are in a new freedom struggle, asserting self-determination. They are not a part of this game in your name, worth Rs. 3,500 crores with about 200 crores illegally collected from public enterprises as CSR, as per a CAG report. What is CSR ? That will be for another letter on another day Sardar… Your avatar shall stand tall, Sardar. In the midst of the river, on the Varata Bawa Tekri. We watch with hope that your Avatar shall watch over and stop all that is unjust, against unity, equity and sustainability. We seek the blessings and support of your iron hand for today and for ever. We look forward to having you there when adivasis raise their voice, amidst festive tourists who will gather on the 31st and everyday, with or without your legacy, but all vows for a new touristocracy. We know you alone will listen to the adi-vasis, their cry halt, inspiring them to fight for their rights and the Mother River’s too !. Narmada appeals to you, Sardar !

147,Sulagna Sengupta,"Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Tuesday slammed the  . Accusing the saffron party of politicising the death of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, she said what the party was doing with the former prime minister's funeral ash was “utmost disrespect and disgrace” to him. While the BJP has undertaken a countrywide 'Atal Asthi Kalash Yatra' with urns containing ash, the Opposition has accused it of playing with the emotion of people. The Bengal unit of the party was to hold a memorial meet for Vajpayee Wednesday, where Banerjee is an invitee along with Opposition leaders. Addressing a rally of her party Trinamool Congress's students wing, Banerjee said: “We held Vajpayeeji in high esteem. We paid respect to him in New Delhi after his death. Now what (BJP) are doing with his ash is a severe disrespect to him. We condemn it.” Banerjee also questioned the source of foreign funds for the BJP and its ideological mentor, the  ' and asked why should there be no scrutiny of the sources of such funds. “If there is no audit for their (BJP's) money, which has been pumped into the party, why should there be an audit for ours? The BJP will use all foreign funds to purchase votes but won't take care of the people for the rest of the term,” she said. The CM also took up the issue of the National Register of Citizens recently drafted in neighbouring Assam. The Bengal BJP has already demanded such an exercise in the state. “They are saying the NRC will be done here. Let them try!” she said. Banerjee also accused the   government at the Centre of central agencies to threaten Opposition leaders and disturbing the state police.” The Central Bureau of Investigation recently wrote to West Bengal Police, seeking statements of four Indian Police Service officers (one of them retired) who earlier investigated the Saradha scam.  She also blamed the BJP and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) for the killing of a Trinamool worker in Jhargram. Banerjee also cautioned students about fake news and alleged that the BJP was funding fake news via social media, portraying Bangladesh as Bengal, using scenes from movies to depict reality etc. “They might have money, but we have brains.

148,Shriya Bhasin,"  If we go by a report of NDTV, around 75,000 tribals across 72 villages in Gujarat’s Narmada district have been badly affected by the contruction of the statue that had around 3,000 laborers and 300 engineers sweating badly and slaving on it. The  Sardar Sugar Mill in Sankheda because of the financial mismanagement of the board members got shut down leaving behind more than 1,500 farmers waiting for their dues amounting  Rs 12 crore to be paid. Ghanshyam Shah, a political expert based in Gujarat, during an interview that he gave to Mint said, “At a time when Gujarat is facing a water crisis due to lower availability in the Narmada dam, I think the statue project could have been postponed by a year.” Also, if a report by BBC is to be believed a Gujarat farmer, Vijendra Tadvi, said, ""Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district."" ALSO READ:  The controversial 182-meter concrete-steel-bronze acrolith isn’t impressing the opposition much. Senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said, “The Sardar was a true friend of laborers, farmers, Dalits and other economically weak classes with a liberal-democratic ideology but Modi and his party are out to make political capital out of his name without following the Iron Man’s thoughts.” It also came to light in a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India that claimed that as many as five government-owned oil companies were asked to spend as many as Rs 1.5 billion as a part of their CSR (corporate social responsibility) activity. Well, after all this it seems as if everything is fair in love, war and politics especially when the elections are round the corner. But, this wasn’t the change that we wanted to actually see in Modi Ji’s governance and so the question remains the same #whereisthechange?

The rocky statue built in the middle of the waters of the Narmada river in Modi’s home state of Gujarat stands 182 metres (597 feet) tall and is made on the budget of approximately Rs 3000 crore.

149,Rajeev Khanna,"      As the “hug” controversy continues on the Indian political turf, the cricketer-turned-politician   has scored maximum brownie points when it comes to the game of political perceptions and public image. He stands out as the politician in Punjab who has amassed maximum political dividends from the controversy that encapsulates first going for the investiture of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and then hugging the Army chief of the neighbouring country General Qamar Javed Bajwa. The message that has gone down the line among the masses is that by one single act, Sidhu has divided vertically the entire polity of Punjab, including his own Congress party. The criticism by the Congress leaders opposed to Sidhu's act is being construed by observers as nothing but plain 'political insecurity' on a non issue. The Opposition parties stand split and on a sticky ground. The possibility of opening a corridor to Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak is the masterstroke of Sidhu's visit to Islamabad and his interaction with General Bajwa. Several political observers contacted by this reporter pointed out that what needs to be kept in mind is that most Punjabis, particularly Sikhs cannot ever think of severing ties with the neighbouring country where shrines like Nankana Sahib, Katasraj temple and Kartarpur Sahib are located. “It would be like any country severing ties with Saudi Arabia or the Vatican and telling the people of Muslim and Christian faiths to forget about visiting Mecca or Medina and Vatican City. No political party in Punjab can even utter a word on these lines. Neither does the hyper-nationalism which is the flavour of Indian politics at present carry any substance when it comes to attacking Sidhu for visiting Pakistan. Imran Khan calling him a messenger of peace is not an empty statement as sooner or later the two sides will have to sit across the table to sort out the issues and Sidhu's visit can be a start to the process. Political observers point out that Imran inviting cricketers Sidhu along with Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev while not extending the same to his other cricketing contemporaries from other countries simply points out to the fact that he conveyed a special message towards engaging India. After criticising Sidhu for hugging General Bajwa, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh too raised the issue of Kartarpur Sahib corridor with the union government. Amarinder has sought the personal intervention of external affairs minister   in seeking access from the Pakistan government to enable devotees to visit the historic Gurudwara in Kartarpur. In a letter to the Union minister, he urged her to take up the matter with her Pakistani counterpart for having the corridor from the International Border to Kartarpur opened for the duration of the celebrations of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. “Kartarpur is located across the river Ravi at a distance of around 4 km from the International Border near Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district. Amarinder noted that the 550th birth anniversary of the first Guru, who breathed his last in Kartarpur, is being observed in November 2019. He pointed out that one of the historical demands of the Sikh community has been to have access to the revered Gurudwara Sahib in Kartarpur. “The government of Punjab has been requesting government of India time and again for taking up the matter with the government of Pakistan for a corridor from the International Border to Kartarpur,” he added. He said that in pursuance of the long-standing demand, former Prime Minister Dr.   had made an announcement to this effect at Amritsar on September 1, 2004 on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the Prakash Utsav of Guru Guru Granth Sahib. He had reiterated the same during his subsequent visits to Punjab in 2005 and 2006. However, despite best efforts this has not materialized. Earlier, Amarinder had said that Sidhu hugging the Pakistani Army Chief was not a nice gesture and was completely avoidable. He said Sidhu should have avoided indulging in such a gesture when Indian soldiers were getting killed every day on the borders. He underlined that after all, it is the Army Chief who gives the orders to kill, with the soldiers merely following the same. As far as the Congress opponents go the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and   (BJP) castigated Sidhu on expected lines of their brand of nationalism despite the fact that it was none other than their poster boy and Prime Minister   who had gone and hugged former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during the latter's birthday celebrations in 2015. The SAD leadership lambasted Sidhu for insulting families of martyrs by hugging General Bajwa. Party leader Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said the very visit of Sidhu to Pakistan at a time when the nation was in mourning after former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's demise was in bad taste. “Sidhu went ahead with the visit and violated all known protocols of not attending any celebratory function during official periods of mourning,” he said. However, the Aam Aadmi Party's ( ) state chief Bhagwant Mann did not reportedly find anything wrong with Sidhu's “Punjabi” gesture. Coming back to the political dynamics within the Congress, it is no secret that efforts have been on in the past also to corner Sidhu within the Punjab cabinet and the party. He has been cold shouldered on several occasions. Much to the disliking of many people, he has emerged as one of the poles in the party and many see him playing a greater role in the party affairs in the days to come. Some observers even see him along with finance minister Manpreet Badal as a possible successor to Amarinder. His closeness to the party high command is another factor that brings discomfort to many in the party. Despite being cornered, he has been saying that he would not stop from raising his voice on issues. At the same time he has been saying that he respects and honours Amarinder's decisions. Meanwhile, the hug controversy has transcended media borderlines as write ups have started targeting Amarinder's relations with his Pakistani friend Aroosa Alam. These are indications that the hug controversy is there to stay for sometime.  ",2018-08-23,," Despite criticism, Sidhu's 'hug' has proven to be a masterstroke | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/despite-criticism-sidhu-s-hug-has-proven-to-be-a-masterstroke-129292.html
150,Sulagna Sengupta,"In a repsite to the Trinamool Congress, the Supreme Court Friday ruled out relections to the 20,159 Panchayat seats in Bengal which the party won without contest. This also means the Mamata Banerjee government can now form district boards across the state. Opposition parties alleged their candidates could not file nominations for those seats in the May Panchayat elections because of the violence unleashed by Trinamool workers. The matter reached the apex court after the Opposition including the   and the Congress, aproached the Calcutta High Court. A Bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud invoked Article 142 of the Constitution and held that the limitation period of 30 days for filing the election petitions expired and will now commence from the date of notification of results. “Whoever is aggrieved with the election results can file their petitions before the concerned court within 30 days,” the Bench said. It also set aside a High Court order, allowing e-filing of nominations through WhatsApp or e-mail. “The high court was in error while allowing the filing of nomination papers through electronic forms,” it said, adding, “no such process is either mentioned nor allowed under the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act”. Bharatiya Janata Party State General Secretary Sayantan Basu said the party would consult its lawyers. Calling the verdict a historic victory, state Panchayt Minister Subrata Mukherjee said boards would be formed within a week. “I am confident we will again place first in the rankings by the Union Panchyat department ,” he said. “We are happy with the verdict. The court said it won’t entertain any panchyat-related cases further,” said advocate Kalyan Banerjee, who represented Trinamool. BJP National Secretary Rahul Sinha expressed displeasure with the verdict but said he was confident the party will increase its tally in the 2019 General Elections. ",2018-08-24,, Mamata has the last laugh at SC in Panchayat polls issue | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/mamata-has-the-last-laugh-at-sc-in-panchayat-polls-issue-129450.html
151,Rajeev Khanna,"The recent developments on Punjab's political turf point towards one thing – Panthic issues will be at the core of the campaign for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls while real problems will be at the second or third rung. The grounds have been prepared for political battles on these issues that have taken the centre stage while the problem of drug menace, farmer suicides, unemployment, etc stand pushed back. Right now it is the findings of the Justice (retired) Ranjit Singh Commission on the instances of sacrilege of holy texts that has emerged as a major point of contention between the ruling   and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). The commission report, leaked recently, reportedly indicts former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal for being in the know of police action on protestors at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in 2015 that led to the death of two persons. This has put the Akalis on the back foot.  But the party has launched a counter attack. Its President, Sukhbir Singh Badal, alleged a “sinister conspiracy to defame the erstwhile SAD-BJP ( ) government and divide the Sikh community.” He released call details to accuse Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, his ministers as well as Ranjit Singh of consorting with radical ‘sarkari’ jathedars to vet the Commisison report tabled in the state Assembly last Monday. “The unholy nexus between the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party ( ) and ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intlligence)-sponsored radical outfits to help the Congress wash its sins against the Sikhs is out in the open,” Sukhbir said. He also accused Amarinder of meeting Sikh radical Baljit Singh Daduwal secretly at his residence.  Taking strong exception to these allegations the CM called for a probe by the Speaker into the charge of his meeting Daduwal. On the other hand, Sikh harliners have been holding a 'Morcha' at Bargari for a couple of months now, seeking action against the police officers guilty of firing at the protestors and those responsible for sacrilege of holy texts. The issue of sacrilege is all set to dictate the political discourse in this sensitive border state ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Along with the Commission's findings has been the recent decision of the Punjab Cabinet for bringing in amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedures and the Indian Penal Code to make sacrilege of all religious texts punishable with life imprisonment for “curbing such incidents and maintaining communal harmony” in the state. According to an official spokesperson, the Cabinet approved insertion of Section 295AA to the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to provide that “whoever causes injury, damage or sacrilege to Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Srimad Bhagwad Geeta, Holy Quran and Holy Bible with the intention to hurt the religious feelings of the people, shall be punished with imprisonment for life.” While the move has been termed 'regressive' by many intellectuals, no political party has come forward to denounce it. This move too is all set to be played up during the poll campaign. Meanwhile, the dynamics within the main political forces are changing. With AAP continuing to function as a split force following the rebellion led by Sukhpal Singh Khaira and some of its legislators aligned with him, the party is is no position to reap political dividends in Parliamentary elections. The Congress remains smug with almost the entire support base of AAP, along with the Hindu voters, making a shift towards it during the recent bye-elections. Though it is facing criticism for failing to deliver on promises made ahead of last year's Assembly polls, curbing drug abuse problems, Controlling law-and-order and addressing unemployment, continuing anger among the public against the previous Akali-BJP regime is helping the Grand Old Party. The Akalis have meanwhile chosen to project as a party working for the aspirations of Sikhs, with Sukhbir reportedly trying to resurrect the party on those lines. This comes as a deviation of the party's 'Punjab, Punjabi and Punjabiyat' stand that it had been taking since its Moga anniversary in 1996. The Akalis are trying to project the Congress as anti-Sikh and the recent comments of the Congress president   on the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom at an interaction in London has given them enough fodder to rake up the issue once again to put the Congress on the back foot. The issue of '84 keeps returning ahead of elections despite the fact that the state has elected Congress governments in both Delhi and Punjab on multiple occasions since then. The Akalis face the counter charge of having failed to get the BJP, which is their ally at the Centre to get justice for the victims of '84 riots during the National Demcratic Alliance regimes led by Atal Behari Vajpayee and now  . The BJP that continues to throw in its lot with the Akalis remains on a sticky wicket. It remains on the defensive for the actions of its central leadership. Both demonetisation and shoddy implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have ensured its base of small Hindu traders making a departure. The Akalis projecting themselves as party of Sikhs too is expected to have its implementation. The party also lacks a face at the state level. It looks imminent that issues pertaining to religion will dominate the political discourse in the state in the months to come. The real issues will once again take a back seat.

152,Joyjeet Das,"Thursday's gathering showed that surprise has given way to anger. Speaker after speaker blew holes in the 'Urban Naxal' narrative – holes that the Modi government, the BJP and its ideological fountainhead, the  , will find hard to plug. They included: After Dhawan, whose PUDR colleague Gautam Navlakha is on the Pune Police's list, flagged off the session Roy took over, alleging that the drive against Bharadwaj, Navlakha and activists Varavara Rao, Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves was basically a crackdown on dissent – an effort to drive fear. Drawing links between the polic action and next year's general elections, she said “lies are being spread” using a section of the media.  “What is the evidence (against the accsued) the police have?” asked the seasoned activist who helped the erstwhile   government with public policy. Highlighting the work done by Bharadwaj, Navlakha and others for the marginalised, she asked “can no one speak for Dalits and the poor?” Parikh likened the current situation with the Emergency imposed by former PM Indira Gandhi and charged the current regime with similar misuse of power. His PUCL colleague Pancholi agreed. “We should take lessons,” he said and recounted how the people had backed civil liberites over relative prosperity in the '70s.  He also condemned the coinage of terms like 'Urban Naxals' and its use by the establishment – a sentiment shared by Menon-Sen. “Strange animals are being created. On the one hand we have the peacock that doesn't lay eggs but reproduce by consuming tears; on the other hand we have the Urban Naxal,” she said. “What is their crime? Upholding and propagating the Constitution and constitutional values?” she asked. The gender activist warned the “ones in power” that their efforts would backfire. “We see through their games,” she said. Wilson, who has long worked for the upliftment of manual scavengers underscored an anti-Dalit line in the government's thinking and working. Calling the crackdowns an “attack on fundamental rights”, he alleged that an atmosphere of fear was being created where one wasn't free to act. The State was against Dalit assertion, he said. “We have beenn enslaved for 5,000 years. What's wrong with celebrating Bhima-Koregaon?” he asked and pointed out how activist-poet Rao's daughter was questioned by the police on her choice of marrying a Dalit and not marking herself with vermillion. On the other hand, there were no arrests of those who burn copies of the Constitution, he said. Mevani, who has gained quite a following in the recent years, said there was a combination of three things: an undeclared Emergency, fascism and the 'Gujarat model'. He said those against the “Sangh” were being terrorised and Dalit assertion was being discredited. He cited the examples of atrocities in Una (Gujarat) and Shahranpur (Uttar Pradesh), the imprisonment of Dalit activist Chandrasekhar and prohibitory orders against him in districts of Rajasthan as examples of how the regime was against “andolankaris”. Mevani, who was present at the Elgar Parishad meeting before the Bhima-Koregaon episode, ridiclued the police claim of a plot to assasinate PM Modi. “This used to happen in Gujarat: every year some or the other jihadi supposedly came to kill him and died in encounters,” he said. Alleging that the police of Delhi and Maharashtra were acting in collusion, he pointe dout that central minister Ramdas Athavale has already ruled out any Maoist links of those who were at the Bhima-Koregaon Dalit celebration. Mevani announced wider agitations on 5 and 15 September. “What is happening in the country now? Attacks on Adivasis, Dalits and Minorities; lynch mobs are being unleashed,” said Bhushan, addign that the likes of 'Sambhaji' Bhide and Milind Ekbote were walking free. Focusing on symantics, he said Urban Naxals was a coinage similar to the 'Tukdetukde Gang' that was used against student activists leading up to a physical attack on Kanhaiya Kumar and a recent attempt to kill Umar Khalid. “Even the police used the term (Urban Naxals) in court. Me, Aruna, Arundhati... we are called Urban naxals,” he said. Bhushan pointed out that those against whom the police were acting were not even present in Bhima-Koregaon. “Democracy is not killed by military coups. The fascists eliminate human rights gradually, so not many understand what's happening, unlike during the Emergency that happened in one stroke. Everythign is now at stake,” Bhushan said. Man-Booker winner Roy pointed out that there was already an acceptance by the police that the activists were “anti-fascists” as they said in the Pune court. She said “the government knew there would be a reaction” and drew attention to the recent drop in Modi's popularity ratings according to a recent ABP Lokniti survey. Touching upon various issues, including the Rafale deal, she said what was going on was a “coup against the Constitution. Simultaneously, there was a show of solidarity nearby in Parliament Streets organised and attended by a slew of organisations including the New Trade Union Initiative and the National Association for People's Movements. Bharadwaj, Navlakha, Rao, Gonsalves and Ferreira, meanwhile, are confined to their houses until the Supreme Court takes the matter up again on 6 September. The Pune Police has failed to yet establish any conclusive charges against them or Stan Swami and Anand Teltumbde – whose houses they raided – related to the Bhima-Koregaon. Eventually, the cops even claimed that the activists and their “Maoist” links were under probe from even before the Dalit celebration episode. The apex court may eventually bring some sanity into the Kafkaesque atmosphere, but Thursday's session and social media outrage has made it clear that the government has now riled the normally composed civil society.There was a strange sense of deja vu when an impessive cast of social activists gathered at the Press Club of India Thursday. They were there to register their protest against the way the Maharashtra Police has gone after their fellow activists across the country, labelling them nothing short of terrorists. Among others in the crosshairs of the Pune Police is labour rights activist Sudha Bharadwaj. Some two-and-a-half months ago, when the same police picked up and whisked away Sudhir Dhavale, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Rona Wilson and Mahesh Raut (June 6), Bharadwaj joined forces with legal activists – she herself is an advocate and is the vice-president of Indian Association of People's Lawyers – to condemn the crackdown. In that  , Bharadwaj, Supreme Court advocate Nithya Ramachandran, Progressive Women's Association's advocate Poonam and others raised serious question marks on the intent of the police force and the   (BJP) – in power in Maharashtra as well as at the Centre – on whose order it was acting. All the same there was a sense of surprise among the speakers at the way the estalishment had gone after those they believed were workign only for common good.",2018-08-30,, Bhima-Koregaon to Urban Naxal: In the process Modi and Co has riled civil society | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bhima-koregaon-to-urban-naxal-in-the-process-modi-and-co-has-riled-civil-society-130310.html
153,Speed News Desk,"Johnson’s observation is mischievous, and has a political purpose, the Imam’s an exaggeration. The observations are troubling for an Indian Muslim. I would avoid being judgemental on a community which has been under immense pressure because of rampaging Islamophobia since the 90s. And yet, I cannot help asking: is the burqa a response to nasty Islamophobia or a means of aggravating it? Aggravation of the problem is surely not our purpose. Then whose purpose is served by Muslim women floating around Oxford Circus in gear which distances them, in geometrical progression, from the host population? Of the clerics, eager to consolidate their congregations? Wouldn’t it be wonderful if these congregations had in their midst scholars, doctors, writers, scientists, entrepreneurs, rather than pliant women fitting Boris Johnson’s description. I am troubled for another reason. After extensive travel around the world, I am inclined to cast my vote in recent years for Britain as a society where Human Rights, Rule of Law, Race relations are most secure. That is why I am uneasy at the two observations. Let me turn to India to bring out my point, by comparison, in bolder relief. The depths to which Hindu-Muslim relations have sunk in India is attributed by pundits to the brazenly communal politics of the ruling BJP under Prime Minister,   since 2014. If an ancient civilization, embracing 1.25 billion people can be so totally transformed in merely four years, Modi and his cohorts deserve to be celebrated as miracle men. No, the present government has clearly accelerated the communal agenda but the ground for it was diligently laid over 71 years of independence. The ruling party for most of these decades was the Congress. Social disharmony was built into the manner in which Partition was affected. The Congress was firmly opposed to the two-nation theory enunciated by Mohammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan – that Hindus and Muslims constituted two separate nations. But the Congress accepted Lord Mountbatten’s June 3, 1947 plan for Partition in double quick time. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, former President of the Congress and others warned Pandit Nehru that Partition would mean “unadulterated Hindu Raj”. By that logic once the Congress Working Committee had accepted a Muslim state, with a small Hindu minority, named Pakistan, it logically followed that the rest of India would be Hindustan or a Hindu state with a substantial Muslim minority. In other words, on August 15, 1947 India glided seamlessly from British Raj to Hindu Raj but Nehru chose not to use the term “Hindu” for a variety of reasons. A “Hindu” state was an affront to his self image. Self image was important to Nehru. The basic reason why Nehru avoided the term “Hindu” to describe the new found state was Kashmir. How could a Hindu state claim the Muslim majority province of Kashmir on the principle of contiguity? Look at it from the hard core Hindu perspective. After a thousand years of Muslim rule, 200 of British, the Muslim state of Pakistan does come into being. But, alas no Hindu state. The sophistry of why it is so is lost on the millions. This is where the Hindu communalist pitches his tent. It turns out that, over the decades, a compulsive hatred for Pakistan has emerged an acid test for nationalism. Into this bubbling cauldron has been pushed a boulder – the post 9/11 war against terror. The Islamophobia this has generated globally has been grist to the Hindu communalist’s mill too. I have argued in my book “Being The Other: The Muslim in India” that calling a spade a spade at the very outset would have minimized the social disharmony that has plagued us for 71 years. From day one we should have declared ourselves a Hindu state. The Hindu in this “raj” would have been at the steering wheel but the minorities would have struck a stronger bargain for education, seats in Parliament, jobs in the cabinet, Civil Service, Police, Armed Forces and so on. Detractors raise a howl of protest. How can a theoretic state be secular? In the recent elections in Pakistan three Hindus, Mahesh Malani, Hari Ram Kishwari Lal and Giyan Chand Essrani, won from general seats in Sind – one for the National Assembly and two for the Provincial Assembly. The fact that Britain is a Protestant monarchy did not come in the way of Sadiq Khan serving as London’s high profile Mayor. Last year Donald Trump banned travel to the US from several Muslim countries. He was therefore not accorded a “state” visit to Britain because in that event protocol would have involved the Mayor of London. In India’s circumstances in 1947, a Hindu India may have been better, than the one cloaked in a hollow and bogus secularism where the police watch on as one Muslim (or Dalit) after another is lynched, some to the accompaniment of expert photography. By Saeed NaqviIn normal times Britain’s former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson’s observation that burqa clad women resemble walking “letter boxes” and “bank robbers” would evoke laughter. But these are not normal times. Just when liberals were beginning to pelt stones at him, a startling turn to the debate was given by Taj Hargay, Imam of Oxford. “The burqa is a Wahabi fifth column…we will wake up in the Islamic Republic of Britain.”",2018-09-04,," Since Burqa Has No Kuranic Injunction, Why Annoy Host Societies? | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/since-burqa-has-no-kuranic-injunction-why-annoy-host-societies-131035.html

Everyone is waiting to see how he manages to salvage himself this time.   The Congress is now trying to corner the Akalis on Panthic issues, particularly the instances of sacrilege and the firing on protestors at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in 2015 by the police that had led to two deaths. Reports quoting the Ranjit Singh Commission say that Badal was in the know how of the police action at Kotkapura.   For the Akalis, the things have taken a turn for the worse with the issue of the party dominated Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) and the Akal Takht in granting the apology to the Dera Saccha Sauda chief Ram Rahim coming back to haunt them at the time when the Dera followers have reportedly been held for sacrilege. The Dera chief who is presently in jail for rape had been accused of blasphemy in 2007 for allegedly wearing an attire similar to Guru Gobind Singh. It has been none other than the former SGPC chief Avtar Singh Makkar who in a media interview claimed that he had been kept out of loop on the issue of apology and had been approached by Badal's son and deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal with the decision on the day the apology was granted. He claimed that he had advised Sukhbir to first consult all Sikh bodies and take them into confidence to which the latter had agreed. But by evening he came to know that the apology had been granted. The apology was withdrawn later following a public outcry.   At this point Badal stands cornered on Kotkapura firing and Sukhbir is feeling the heat on the issue of the apology. There is also a vertical divide within the Akalis emerging on these issues and also the fact of Sukhbir 'running away' from the debate on the Commission report in the state assembly last week. Several Akali leaders are of the view that the party should have contested the allegations coming from the ruling party along with the main opposition Aam Aadmi Party ( ) and put forward their views.   The Congress under Captain Amarinder Singh is going on the offensive on daily basis at a time when the Lok Sabha polls are barely eight months away although the government is yet to get a FIR registered in the matter and a large number of the Congress leaders are peeved over the leadership making a lot of noise but nut supplementing it with enough action on the ground.   On Tuesday, Amarinder accused Badal of ruining Punjab and held him squarely responsible for the Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan firing incidents. He vowed to go hammer and tongs after Badal and fix him.   Reacting to Badal’s assertion that he was ready to swear that he did not know about the firing, Amarinder dismissed it as a gimmick to divert public attention from his role in the incident. He pointed that the former DGP Sumedh Saini had clearly stated before the Ranjit Singh Commission that Badal had asked him to disperse the crowd forcibly. “If something happens in my state then as Chief Minister I cannot take refuge in such lies and should be thrown out if I am not aware of what is happening right under my nose,” he asserted while adding that as per the Commission’s findings, as many as 22 calls were made to Badal before the firing took place.   Badal and Sukhbir have been trying to get their act together by trying to present the SAD as a party of Sikhs. They have also been going to town sayting that it was the Congress that has carried out the biggest instance of sacrilege when former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had 'rolled tanks and mortars to destroy Akal Takhat and shatter the sacred bosom of Shri Harmandar Sahib'. They have been pointing that countless ‘saroops’ of holy Guru Granth Sahib were desecrated by the forces then. Badal has warned Amarinder against playing with fire and pushing Punjab back into the jaws of violence and bloodshed. “The flames that turned the urban and country landscape of Punjab almost to ashes are still raging. And you are preparing to unleash new flames. Have mercy on the innocent and peaceful men, women, youth and children of Punjab and roll back your forces of hatred,” he said.   He said that as the Chief Minster he devoted all his time and energy to ensure peace and communal harmony and understanding among various sects in the state. “My mind and my conscience are absolutely clean in this regard. I am not scared of the threats being thrown by a hollow braggart who wastes his life in the pursuit of unethical pleasures. I have discharged with utmost honesty, transparency, dedication and commitment whatever sacred duty had been assigned to me by the people of Punjab,” he conveyed.   Commenting on the 'painful' incidents of sacrilege and the consequent police action in October 2015, Badal said, “ It was a period of unbearable pain and stress on my mind. I remained in live contact with the district administration officials and the DGP till well past midnight. There was never a minute when I was able to go to sleep peacefully as the situation was extremely delicate and critical.” He further said there were clear and firm instructions from him that the entire issue should be resolved through discussion and dialogue. “At no stage was the issue of police firing even considered and nor were any orders passed by me in this regard,” he added. Badal was the leader who resurrected the SAD and himself in 1997 from oblivion by coming to power after more than a decade when they had almost been written off. Can he repeat the feat again? The Akalis would definitely be looking at him once again.  ",2018-09-13,, Badal cornered: Will he wriggle out of this mess? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/badal-cornered-will-he-wriggle-out-of-this-mess-132471.html

Issuing a strict memo to party leaders, Gandhi assertively said that the lawyers from the party should avoid fighting for Anil Ambani on the Rafale issue on which the opposition parties are targeting the   government. Earlier, Ambani’s companies sent notices to Congress spokespersons over the issue and told Gandhi that he is ‘misinformed, misdirected and misled’ about the multi-billion dollar jet fighter deal. Gandhi questioned the government over the deal many times in public as well as in the parliament, pointing out that the governments stroke the deal with the price of three times higher than that negotiated by the UPA government with France’s Dassault Aviation, the manufacturer of the aircraft. His party along with other politicians has been demanding to disclose the price of the aircraft. The party also demanded a joint parliamentary committee on the deal. Eyeing on the 2019 general elections, Gandhi asked the party leaders to avoid cases that becomes a tool of attack on the party from the government or that weaken the party stands. This precautionary warning issued because in the past, some party leaders such as Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi took up the cases which were against the party’s standing. Sibal had defended the triple talaq on behalf of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) in the Supreme Court. It seems that his defence did not go well with the party bigwigs.

The party's in-charge for West Bengal held a two-day meeting in Kolkata, in which it was decided that BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha will be fielded from North Kolkata against senior All India Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandhyopadhyay. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh is likely to contest from West Midnapore, in a effort to capitalise on the party's recent gainst in the area. He is likely to be up against sitting AITC MP Sandhya Roy. Presently Ghosh is the MLA from Kharagpur but BJP sources say that he has been able to build a strong base in some of the tribal pockets in West Midnapore, such as Dantan and Keshiary. Similarly, BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu is likely to contest from Purulia. Basu said, “A meeting was convened. Nothing has been finalised on seats....If the BJP leadership wants me to contest from Purulia, I will contest from the seat”. In Dum Dum, BJP is planning to field Shamik Bhattacharya against senior AITC leader Sougata Roy. Locket Chatterjee of the BJP is likely to be fielded against the AITC's Shatabdi Roy in Birbhum.

According to Banerjee, “The Centre is playing a divide and rule policy. People's names have been struck off even though they have the necessary documents. So many Bengalis, Biharis, Hindus, and Muslims are very much Indians, but their names have been dropped”. Banerjee said she would take the matter up with Union Home Minister   during her visit to Delhi this week. She has also instructed her MPs to visit Assam to assess the ground situation as people who have been excluded from the NRC list could not be contacted. “I am worried about the present situation in Assam as internet services have been suspended and we unable to trace the whereabouts of hundreds of people staying there. I have also received information that 15 companies of central paramilitary forces have been pressed into service in Assam”. “I will tell my MPs to visit Assam soon. I will also visit the state if the situation becomes worse. If something happens in Assam it will definitely affect Bengal. Therefore, we cannot remain mute spectators,” she added. Banerjee complained that the Centre undertook this process without consulting states like West Bengal, which would be affected. Addressing a press conference on Monday, Banerjee said that NRC was a ploy by the BJP government divide communities ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “In its effort to play politics, BJP has forgotten humanity.

165,Anurag Dey,"Flaying the Opposition for questioning Assam's draft National Register of Citizens (NRC), BJP President   on Tuesday demanded that all political parties should clarify their stand on “Bangladeshi infiltrators”. He asked them “if they wanted to compromise India’s security by patronising the 40 lakh people who have been left out of the first draft of the NRC”. Hours after the Rajya Sabha was disrupted over the NRC issue, Shah held a press conference in the national capital and declared that the over 40 lakh people left out of the NRC were illegal Bangladeshi infiltrators and were liable to be ousted from the country. Targeting West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Congress President  , Shah alleged that they were intentionally spreading misinformation about NRC for the sake of vote-bank politics. “The over 40 lakh people, who have been kept out of the NRC, are infiltrators. Although it is only a draft and hearing on the objection is still pending but only those people’s name have been struck off who could not prove their citizenship. “These 40 lakh people are infiltrators and except for BJP no other political party has expressly stated that these infiltrators have no place in India,” said Shah adding that he was forced to held the media conference as he was not allowed to speak in Rajya Sabha due to disruptions by opposition members particularly the Trinamool Congress. Claiming that no Indian citizen was debarred by the NRC, Shah accused the Congress and the Trinamool of spreading lies and misinformation. “They are misleading the people in believing that Indian citizens have been delisted from the NRC. The truth is only those who failed to prove their citizenship have not found their names in the NRC. “I demand that all the parties should clarify their stand on the issue. Those who are talking about human rights of the infiltrators and accusing BJP of discrimination, they should make their stand clear. They should clarify whether by patronising these infiltrators, do they want to compromise the security of the country, do they want the country’s resources be exploited by these Bangladeshi infiltrators,” asked Shah. Reminding the Congress that the NRC owes its existence to the Assam Accord signed by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Shah ridiculed the grand old party for its changing stand. “NRC is the soul of the Assam Accord which was signed by the Congress government. Be it then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi or former home minister P Chidambaram, all have said that Bangladeshi infiltrators have no place in India. But now when the Congress is not in power it is patronising the infiltrators and talking about their human rights. “The Assam Accord says that each and every infiltrator shall be found out and struck out of the NRC. It’s the Congress which laid the foundation of the NRC but they didn’t had the courage to deal with illegal infiltrators. They were not concerned about the welfare of the citizens of Assam. Don’t the people have Assam have human rights? Aren’t their human rights infringed when these infiltrators rob their jobs, their resources?” asked Shah.   Addressing Mamata Banerjee and Rahul Gandhi, Shah said, “Don’t let vote bank politics decide your stand. We never indulge in vote-bank politics. We believed NRC should be firmly implemented when we were in opposition and saying the same now. “NRC is being prepared in a very transparent manner and under monitoring of the Supreme Court. I want to clarify that no Indian will have problems with this. Only those who have infiltrated from outside the country will have to face the consequence. I strongly condemn the political parties’ attempts to spread misinformation and claim that this would cause tension among regions,” added Shah. Earlier speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Shah said that the NRC was being conducted on the Supreme Court’s order and pointed out to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi signing the Assam Accord in 1985.   “NRC was the Congress initiative but Congress did not have the courage to implement it.

166,Rajeev Khanna,"Political crisis and Aam Aadmi Party ( ) in Punjab have moved hand in hand. As the party stares at a vertical split there is a pertinent question that has raised its head -- Is it time to write off AAP in Punjab? The question has to be answered because the state will be voting for its 13 Lok Sabha member in less than a year. At a time when the the party should be coming out with strategies to woo the voter on the ground its members are locked in a fight that is heading towards a split in the ranks. The fresh avalanche to hit AAP came with the party in-charge for Punjab   tweeting last week about the decision to replace the Leader of Opposition in Punjab Sukhpal Singh Khaira with a Dalit face Harpal Singh Cheema. There have been many reasons being attributed to Khaira's removal. One of them was his 'support' to the 'Referendum 2020' being planned by hardline Sikhs living abroad. No amount of clarifications issued by him have worked as his detractors pounced upon the opportunity to discredit him. The second reason being attributed is Khaira not getting along well with the Sangrur MP and senior party leader Bhagwant Mann. He has also been accused of not listening to anyone's advice and going ahead with what he thinks is right. Khaira was also among those who did not approve of AAP's national convener and Delhi Chief Minister   tendering an apology to senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikramjit Singh Majithia for leveling accusations against him with regards to the prevalent drug menace ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls. As expected Khaira did not take his removal lying down. Instead he has turned it into a fight for autonomy for the Punjab unit of the party. He has planned a volunteers' convention in Bathinda on Thursday where majority of the AAP MLAs are expected to be present. This will be a show of strength in the face of the 'dictatorial' approach of the national leadership of the party sitting in Delhi. Backed by several MLAs, Khaira has already demanded his reinstatement as Leader of Opposition. Khaira has the support of the NRI volunteers of the party. These NRIs based in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand recently wrote to the AAP MLAs in Punjab asking them to stand by Khaira in this hour of crisis. Their letter that was circulated in the social media read, “With much due respect, we are very disappointed with recent activities in AAP Punjab units. We all NRIs worked very hard for four years and tried to support you all thru fund raising efforts, walked as volunteers on the ground with you all and executed calling campaigns to convince voters to vote for you all. We have witnessed our big Punjab leadership shrunk to almost zero.” The letter further said, “It is time to show that for us Punjab is above everything. People of Punjab showed utmost faith in all of you and now it is your time to stand with people of Punjab. We are requesting you all please stand with Khaira and stand with Punjab and our all 19-20 teams will support you guys fully.” The series of developments unfolding now were expected to unfold at the time of Kejriwal tendering the apology to Majithia. But it was clear at that point of time that things would go this way sooner or later. The issue of autonomy for the Punjab leadership had started dogging AAP ahead of the last state assembly polls when the issue of distribution of tickets had come up. Just before the time of the ouster of Succha Singh Chhotepur as the state unit chief murmurs of dissent had started against the dominance of the volunteers who had come from outside. The local leadership wanted a greater say in the distribution of tickets and there were all sorts of allegations against Sanjay Singh and Durgesh Pathak who had been sent by the party to establish the organizational network in Punjab. Things had started going downhill from the time Chhotepur was removed and the slide has not stopped till date. Once the party blew up its chances of coming to power in Punjab, even the Delhi leadership stopped taking keen interest in the developments in Punjab. In the present context one needs to look into two simultaneous political developments that have a bearing on the party affairs in Punjab. There is a point of view that the national leadership of the party is right now too focused on Delhi for both the Lok Sabha polls and the subsequent assembly polls. AAP wants to retain power in Delhi and do well in the Lok Sabha polls. It is clear that the party is in no position to repeat its 2014 Lok Sabha performance in Punjab when it won four of the 13 seats in a 'Modi wave'. Two of its Lok Sabha MPs Dr Dharamvira Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa have been suspended by the party. Gandhi has already floated a Punjab Manch which is expected to become a political party in the days to come. He released its 'Punjab Declaration' on Tuesday playing up need for genuine federalism in the country. On his role in context of AAP, he said, “I even voted according to the whip issued by the party for the recent no confidence motion against the   led central government. When it comes to the issue of autonomy for Punjab I do not differ with Khaira.” The second issue that is plaguing the AAP leadership is the possibility of an alliance with the Congress for the Lok Sabha polls. There are many within the party who are open to the idea of this alliance as this would lead to a seat arrangement in Punjab wherein the party can expect to retain a couple of seats despite playing the second fiddle to the Congress. Observers say that in Delhi it would be a role reversal where AAP might call the shots in the event of such an alliance coming into existence. Meanwhile, all the eyes are now on Khaira's convention in Bathinda and its outcome that will decide whether AAP survives or gets divided in the state..",2018-08-01,, AAP headed for a split in Punjab: Is it time to write it off in the state? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/aap-headed-for-a-split-in-punjab-is-it-time-to-write-it-off-in-the-state-125691.html
167,Speed News Desk,"One of the slogans given on the occasion of the creation of July 29 as the Tiger Day at the gathering of Tiger Range countries in St. Petersburg in Russia in 2010 was the doubling of the tiger population which, at that time, was on a steady decline. In another six years(2016), the bodies behind the Tiger Day such as World Wide Fund for Nature(WWF), IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare), and the Smithsonian Institute came out with the positive news that their numbers have increased. The agenda of the Tiger Day was to tackle the problems of large scale habitat loss and increasing animal-human conflicts. The shrinking of forests and increasing human activity which comes with the fast urbanization of the tiger countries were issues of grave concern. All these were compounded by the absence of a political will and a flourishing global trade in tiger parts. As for India, which launched its Project Tiger to conserve the population of tigers back in 1973 after its first tiger census in 1972, the news of multiplying tigers is all the more encouraging. The 2016 figures worldwide put the total number of the big cats at 3890, a big leap from 3200 tigers in 2010. “The revival has been slow but steady. The overall situation is encouraging thought still there are multifarious issues threatening the world tiger population,” observes Rajpal Singh, author and member of the Wildlife Advisory Committee, Rajasthan. “Each of the tiger country has its own specific problem. Take the case of Bangladesh, or even a more resourceful, Russia. The monitoring of tigers in the wild remains poor. One major reason is the vastness of the areas involved along with the paucity of resources,” Mr. Singh denotes. Talking about tigers in India’s wild, the conservationists are more enthusiastic even when they concede that the crisis is not yet over. India which has tiger population in its 17 states has almost doubled their numbers since the commencement of the Tiger Day. Tiger deaths are continuing to disturb both the tiger lovers and policy planners in India. As per the records of the Tigernet, collaboration among national Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the wildlife NGO, TRAFFIC, as many as 76 tigers were killed in the country during 2016. In the previous year the number of casualties was 69. Madhya Pradesh accounted for one third of the deaths while Karnataka, with the largest tiger population in the country, recorded 13 tiger deaths. A large number of deaths were due to direct or indirect human intervention. Poaching was found to be a major threat. “Tiger is not exactly burning bright the world over, though one cannot deny that they are doing reasonably well in India,” says Dharmendra Khandal, conservationist associated with the wildlife NGO, Tiger Watch. “We have reasons to celebrate in Rajasthan, especially in Ranthambhore. The tiger population in Ranthambhore has doubled. Their number is 67 now, highest in the history of the park,” notes Dr. Khandal. “Though I cannot say the same about Sariska tiger reserve which has had its own setbacks and still continues to falter,” Dr. Khandal observes.  Tigers are not yet out of the brink but their tribe is increasing steadily though slowly. India can take pride in the success of the efforts made in the past over the conservation of the tiger population and protection of their habitat as more than half of the wild tigers in the world are in Indian forests.",2018-07-28,, The Day of the Tiger | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/the-day-of-the-tiger-125005.html
168,Charu Kartikeya,"Prime Minister  ’s speech at the ground-breaking ceremony of various projects in Uttar Pradesh was at once a celebration of the crony capitalism he is often accused of and a denigration of every entity that resists it. Ever since Congress President   accused Modi of running a “suit-boot ki sarkaar” over three years ago, this is the first occasion when the PM himself has presented a vocal support of industry. He was not afraid of standing by the side of industralists, Modi said. This strange defence could not have come at a worse moment for him, at a time when his government is facing a relentless campaign unleashed by the Congress party over the multi-million dollar Rafael deal. The Congress has alleged that Modi-government agreed to inflated costs of fighter jets to benefit Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Defence. In spite of multiple rebuttals, BJP has not been able to conclusively dispel these charges. Gandhi and his party have kept up the heat on Modi with fresh charges related to the deal on almost a daily basis. Modi’s Lucknow speech was clearly a response to these allegations, but it is unlikley to have helped his case. Look at how he framed the discourse. In his defence of industry, he began with listing legal checks and balances, environmental concerns and media scrutiny as evils and as insurmountable challenges. Note the brazen underlying assumption – all private capital is noble while legal requirements, environment compliances and media coverage are obstacles. The country is run either by the Prime Minister or by the patwari, Modi went on to say, clearly showing his own inability to look beyond himself. The structure of the state – comprising the legislature, executive (headed by the President acting on the advice of a Council of Ministers) and judiciary – does not matter to the Prime Minister. Neither do the people who elect their representatives to govern the country on their behalf or the Constitution that provides the foundation of the state. “We are not those who are afraid of standing by the side of industrialists, unlike those who are never photographed with any businessmen but all businessmen pay obeisance at their doorteps,” Modi stressed. “When the intention is clean, one can stand with anybody without attracting any stains,” he elaborated. In this context, he also chose to give the example of Mahatma Gandhi’s friendship with GD Birla. It is baffling to try to understand how can allegations of helping businessmen seen as close to the PM, and other leaders of the ruling party, with government largesse be equated with the relationship between the leader of India’s freedom movement and an ideologically committed businessman who supported the struggle. What exactly is Modi trying to argue by putting poor farmers, artisans, labourers, bankers-financers, bureaucrats and industrliasts in the same bracket? All businesses are not being maligned here. The scrunity is directed only at a select few against whom evidence of receiving undue favours from the government is piling up. Modi also said no action used to be taken against crony capitalists earlier because previous governments were involved in various dealings with them behind the scenes. “Don’t we know in whose planes do people travel,” was Modi’s apparent taunted at Opposition leaders. He appears to have conveniently forgotten how he himself, as Chief Minister of Gujarat and the BJP’s prime-ministerial candidate (in 2013-14) used to travel in a prominent businessman’s aircraft.",2018-07-30,, It has taken Modi four years to defend his belief in crony capitalism | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/it-has-taken-modi-four-years-to-defend-his-belief-in-crony-capitalism-125345.html
169,Akash Bisht,"With General Elections less than a year away, news reports have emerged that the   (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party ( ),   and   (RLD) have reached a broad agreement over seat sharing in Uttar Pradesh. These parties have been in talks with each other to stitch together a grand alliance to take on the   (BJP) in the most politically significant state, which sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha. Not only UP, the parties have also been in talks over seat sharing for the upcoming Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. However, the talks have hit rough weather with Congress not ceding to the demands of its possible allies. It is for this reason that SP leadership debunked these reports and claimed that talks over seat sharing are being held only with the BSP and RLD. A senior SP leader vehemently denied such “rumors” and said they were based on “WhatsApp forwards” rather than on ground reality. “They can conjure any numbers they want. As far as SP is concerned, we have not had any such talks. Congress' arrogance in allotting respectable seats to alliance partners for upcoming Assembly polls in other states has led to an impasse. They want more than what they deserve in UP and are not ready to accommodate their partners in other states. Even Mayawatiji is facing similar trouble with Congress,” he said. He further added that it didn't make any sense to have an alliance with Congress in UP considering the Grand Old Party is more of a liability than an asset. “By giving Congress seats, there is a risk factor involved. Their recent performances in UP is a case in point. They cited similar reasons to not give us seats in other states where they seem to be in powerful position. So, why should we be so accommodating? If Congress wants to defeat BJP then it should not have different parameters for every state. Either we are in this together or we are not. They should clarify their stand,” he said.  Adding to it, he mentioned that at present the SP leadership doesn't feel the need to hold talks with the Congress. “Having any sort of seat sharing formula with the party will only hurt us,” he claimed. It is for this reason, he said that it is not even considering holding talks with the Congress. “We have adopted the policy of keeping away from Congress,” he said.  Meanwhile, Congress is facing similar trouble with BSP over seat sharing in the three states, particularly MP. Sources said the BSP has demanded 50 seats in the state, which has unnerved the Congress leadership leading to a delay in the final announcement. Congress is ready to offer a maximum of 30 seats, which is not acceptable to the BSP which wants similar alliance in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh as well. In the 2013 assembly elections in MP, the BSP secured a 7% vote share, which combined with Congress' 37% could give BJP a tough fight which had 44% share. The party, led by  , contested 227 seats and won just four seats. They managed to get 20,000 votes on 17 seats while secured 10,000 votes in 62 seats. Meanwhile, SP contested on 164 seats failed to win a seat with a total vote share of 1.2%. Moreover, Congress has already sealed a deal with Gondwana Gantantra Party that had secured 1% vote share in the 2013 Assembly polls. Having been in power for three consecutive terms, the BJP is facing massive anti-incumbency in MP which reflected in multiple protests by farmers across the state. For Congress, it is crucial to reach an understanding with the SP and the BSP if it hopes to dethrone the BJP in 2019 and to do that it will have to shed its big brother attitude and accommodate allies in other states. The foundation of a grand alliance in UP in 2019 will depend on how Congress treats its allies or else it will have to be at the mercy of the SP and the BSP. SP leaders have time and again reiterated how Congress on its own would not be able to win even the twin Lok Sabha constituencies held by Sonia and  .",2018-07-31,, Samajwadi debunks reports of deal with Congress | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/samajwadi-debunks-reports-of-deal-with-congress-125524.html
170,Rajeev Khanna,"Taking cricketing relations ahead into the political realm, Punjab's cultural minister   has batted for the new Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan saying that the latter's elevation to the top political post brings forth a new dawn promising an era of hope. Sidhu along with other prominent personalities like Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev from the cricketing world along with Aamir Khan from Bollywood have reportedly been invited for Imran's investiture. He has disclosed that he would be going to the other side of the border with the hope of thawing of relations between the two sides. Sidhu went on the front foot to present Imran as a towering personality of the present era both in the world of cricket as well as in socio-political sphere. Recalling his relations with Imran he recalled how he was hit in the stomach by the very first bowl sent at him by the Pakistani cricketer when he represented Board President XI. “He never attacked the weak as he did not throw any bouncers at me at that time. Things changed when I faced him again in 1988. I was a strong boy who was then hitting sixes,” he said while underlining that he sees Imran as a 'pure soul' and a 'selfless man'. At an interaction with the journalists at Chandigarh Press Club on Thursday, Sidhu said, “What a great leader he is. He generates faith in people. People like Wasim Akram and Waqar Yunus who had come from villages, he created heroes out of non entities.” He also recalled how Imran had brought back the Pakistani team in the 1992 World Cup from the brink of ouster and gone on to lead them to victory. Sidhu pointed that Imran's initiative in setting up a world class cancer hospital in memory of his mother that offers free treatment to the poor speaks volumes about the man who wants to bring happiness to mankind. “I have seen him when he had only one seat in the parliament. I have seen him when he witnessed death from very close quarters. He has again risen from scratch. He fought the system and today he is empowered to change the system,” Sidhu pointed while drawing parallels with Imran since he too has been elected by the people to address their aspirations in Indian Punjab. “That is where I see hope. I am seeing an 'umeed ka suraj' (dawn of hope). I see him as an instrument of realising the dreams. I want to take my Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh to Nankana Sahib for starting the celebrations of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak,” the Indian cricketer turned politician said. He voiced his support for the opening of Kartarpur corridor and bringing back the pre-independence glory to Amritsar Mandi. He said the relations between the two countries should be such that a Punjab should be able to have Makki ki Roti and Saag in Amritsar and Biryani in Lahore on the same day. “The thaw must begin. The ice must melt. He (Imran) can give wings to our aspirations. There are infinite possibilities. He has turned weaknesses into strength, obstacles into stepping stones and obstructions into triumphs,” he said. On being asked to comment government of India's approach towards Imran, Sidhu said that he would not encroach upon Indian government's approach as certain things are decided at the level of ministry of external affairs. On the issue of Imran's approach on Kashmir and the Indian government's stand he said, “On Kashmir my view is that of the Indian government.” “It is my personal opinion that sportsmen break barriers and unite people,” he underlined as he shared anecdotes of the era of Gavaskar, Kapil and Imran. Better ties with Pakistan are an important issue for many Punjabis. As many important Sikh religious places such as Nankana Sahib and Panja Sahib are in Pakistan, Sikh pilgrims often have to bear the brunt of worsening ties between the two countries.",2018-08-02,, Sidhu bats for Imran Khan: Why he is stressing on better relations with Pakistan | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/sidhu-bats-for-imran-khan-why-he-is-stressing-on-better-relations-with-pakistan-125886.html
171,Sulagna Sengupta,"The stand-off between the All India Trinamool Congress and the BJP over the National Register of Citizens intensified on Thursday, with the Assam Police preventing an eight-member AITC team from entering Silchar. The ream comprising eight Trinamool MPs – Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Ratna Dey Nag, Firhad Hakim, Mahua Moitra, Nadimul Haque, Mamata Bala Thakur and Arpita Ghosh had gone to assess the ground situation at Assam in the wake of publication of draft NRC list. They were supposed to attend a citizens convention in Silchar and visit Naogaon and Guwahati . They were were stopped at the Silchar airport and prevented from entering the city by the police. The AITC MPs have alleged that they were manhandled by the police. The MPs said that they would conduct a sit-in demonstration at the airport itself if they were prevented from entering the city. Recounting what happened, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar said “As soon as we reached the arrival lounge of the Silchar airport, we faced confrontation from the police. We were stranded in Sichar airport for three hours. The female police manhandled some of our colleagues like Mahua Moitra, Ratna Dey Nag and Mamata Bala Thakur and another policeman also hit Sukhendu Sekhar Ray. He was roughed up by the police. He suffers from heart problems”. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee condemned the incident and said “If nothing is wrong in Assam then why has Section 144 has been imposed? The police took this action despite Union Home Minister  's assurance that it was fine for our MPs to visit the area....Even our women MPs were manhabdled”. Ghosh Dastidar said that the police even snatched their mobile phones. “The BJP government is doing this for vote bank politics. When there were communal tensions in Asansol a few months back, our government allowed three of their national senior leaders to visit,” she reminded. The AITC MPs said that as Section 144 had been imposed in the area, they had said that they would travel in groups of two. But despite this the police attacked them. “Assam Police personnel roughed up our party's chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, Sukhendu Sekhar Ray. They claimed that a 'super emergency' was on,” said AITC MP Derek O Brien. The BJP has accused the AITC of trying to create trouble in Assam. BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said, “Who asked the Trinamool MPs to visit Silchar now? If they try to create unrest, the Assam government will take appropriate action. The police will do their job”.

172,Anurag Dey,"Accusing the   government of waging a war against the people of the country especially Dalits and minorities, activists from across the nation on Friday demanded immediate release of all political prisoners and repealing of draconian laws like the UAPA and the AFSPA. Addressing an event titled “Kis Kis Ko Qaid Karoge” in the national capital, activists demanded the immediate and unconditional release of wheelchair bound Delhi University professor GN Saibaba, activist Rona Wilson and lawyer Surendra Gadling among five arrested under UAPA in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence and Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar Azad among others. At the event organised by a host of organisations, activists likes celebrated novelist Arundhati Roy and former Bombay High Court judge GB Kolse Patil called Prime Minister Modi and BJP chief   as “perpetrators” of the 2002 Gujarat pogrom and demanded their arrest. Expressing alarm over the abuse of UAPA and AFSPA to stifle dissent, Roy dubbed the   (BJP) as “Bharatiya Jalao Party” and said the saffron brigade’s defeat was imperative to save the country. “As 2019 approaches, the coming months will be more dangerous than you expect. They are the Bharatiya Jalao Party and are ready with matchsticks to stoke communal fire anywhere and everywhere. In the name of caste, in the name of religion, they have been pitting us against each other for their own political motives. “What is happening in Assam today will soon happen in other states and across the country. Then who will decide who are Indians and who should reside in the country?” said Roy referring to Assam's National Register of Citizens (NRC) which has omitted over 40 lakh people sparking allegations of witch-hunt against ethnic minorities. Referring to various political prisoners including GN Saibaba, Roy said the RSS-BJP regime was using “arrest” as a weapon to stifle dissent. “We all know how the judge who was dealing with Amit Shah’s case died mysteriously, but this government instead of probing his death, is busy arresting people who dare to stand against it. Deep down they are afraid of an imminent defeat (in 2019 elections) and they can go to any extent to try and stave off that defeat,” said Roy evoking the mysterious death of CBI judge BH Loya. Calling all to unitedly fight the saffron brigade, Roy said: “Our fight will not end with their defeat in elections, the fight will end only when the “killers of thousands” are arrested and sent to jail”. Speaking in the same vein, Justice Patil said under the Modi regime there is undeclared emergency. “There is undeclared emergency in the country. Whoever dares to stand up against this regime is thrown into jail. Those who opposed the freedom movement (RSS) are now running the show. Unless and until we unite, we cannot fight these forces,” said Patil. Calling for the release of political prisoners, Patil said that Shah and Modi should be in jail for their involvement in the Gujarat riots. “There are evidences proving both Shah and Modi were responsible for the Gujarat riots. Instead of they being in jail, they are running the country. So it for us to decide whether we want to go down without a fight or stand up and overthrow this oppressive regime,” added Patil. Amid the incessant slogans for the release of Saibaba and others, the activists drew the people’s attention towards the serial abuse of laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and Armed Forces (Special Powers) Acts (AFSPA). Enumerating various incidents of UAPA’s abuse and misuse, Kolkata based rights activists Sujata Bhadro demanded the draconian law be immediately repealed. He said the fight for human rights will not be completed unless all political prisoners were released and laws like the UAPA were repealed. Activist Kavita Srivastava of the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) said the Modi regime has unleashed a war on the people of India where every dissenting voice is being thrown into jail. “The list of arrestees is getting longer each day. It’s a procession which will continue and intensify in the coming months. Their (BJP) aim to shut us up either through arrest, through UAPA and through implication in false cases. They can go to any extent.

173,Charu Kartikeya,"An old demand by the BJP for a memorial dedicated to VD Savarkar in France has been exposed as merely an exercise in drumming up emotions. The early Hindutva proponent had made a failed attempt to escape from British captivity in France’s Marseilles in 1910. Even though he failed and was captured again, Hindutva enthusiasts want a memorial to come up in France to commemorate only the attempt. For nearly last two decades, the BJP has tried to corner Congress-led governments for their stand on the memorial. The late Gopinath Munde and former deputy prime minister LK Advani, in July 2009, told the Parliament that the Mayor of Marseilles had expressed willingness to install the said memorial and had asked Government of India if it had any objections. The BJP leaders tried to put the then UPA government on the mat by asking it to clear its position on the issue. The government, expectedly, was evasive and the BJP tried to use it to further drum up sentiments in the Hindutva camp. Cut to 2018. BJP has been in power for over four years now with a brute majority in the Lok Sabha. If Marseilles was indeed ready to honour Savarkar, the  -government should have ideally have at least got the ball rolling as far as the memorial is concerned. However, the government has just informed the Parliament that it has no such plans. BJP MP Poonam Mahajan, also Munde’s niece, had sought to know from the Ministry of External Affairs whether the Mayor of Marseilles has “earmarked land for the construction of Swatantrya Vir Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’s memorial/statue whose expenses shall be borne by the Government”. While the government’s considered response to that question was a polite and curt “no”, it also went on to clarify that the government really had no plans for such a memorial (http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=71332&lsno=16). To Mahajan’s question asking “whether the Government proposes to construct a Savarkar’s memorial at Marseilles”, the MEA replied that the “Ministry of Culture has conveyed that no formal proposal has been received for the construction of Veer Savarkar’s memorial / statute at Marseilles in France”.

174,Rajeev Khanna,"Till now it has primarily been the   (BJP) that has effectively used the Ganga for its political campaign. Right from Prime Minister   who had contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi telling his supporters that Mother Ganga had called him to the city there have been several others in his party who have been seeking votes in the name of programmes like 'Namami Gange' and making announcements of developing Ganga riverfront like the one developed on the Sabarmati in Gujarat. But now it is the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) in Haryana that is out to make use of the same Ganga to take on its opponents in the run up to the Lok Sabha and subsequent state Assembly polls next year. The volunteers of the party in Haryana under the leadership of Naveen Jaihind have embarked on a 500 km long 'Bhaichara Kanwar Yatra' in the state. Starting from Haridwar in Uttarakhand on July 31, the party volunteers are using the annual 'Kanwar Yatra' to give out a political message. They have collected the water of river Ganga which is perceived to be holy in small plastic containers which they intend to give to the top functionaries of the ruling BJP government under Manohar Lal Khattar along with their other political opponents. “The purpose is to tell these people to protect the common bhaichara (social fabric) of the state that they have destroyed through their acts. We will hand over these bottles to Khattar and others while reminding them of their promises and responsibilities towards the people of the state. We will ask them not to cheat the people. We will ask them to desist from playing the politics of region, caste and religion,” said Jaihind during the Yatra's stopover at Chandigarh on Friday. He disclosed that the Yatra will culminate at the Shaheed and Swatantrata Senani Smarak at Maharishi Dayanand University in Rohtak on August 9. “In the last four years the BJP regime has encouraged caste differences to play out and has thus destroyed the social fabric comprising 36 Biradris (communities) in the state. When the rioting was on during the Jat reservation stir and the Congress and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) were trying to reap political dividends from the turmoil AAP was carrying on a 'Meri Jaati-Hindustani' campaign in Rohtak. We have now started this Bhaichara Kanwar Yatra involving the people of all the 36 communities and faiths,” he added. He has listed to whom and why the AAP volunteers want to hand over the small bottles of Gangajal along with packets of prasad that they are carrying from Haridwar. They want Khattar to ensure rule of law in the state where he has stood unraveled time and again on the issue of maintaining law and order. They want health minister Anil Vij to treat the hospitals that are functioning like sick units. AAP wants education minister Ram Bilas Sharma to improve the lot of government schools. The AAP volunteers want agriculture minister Anil Dhankad to address the concerns of the farmers. They will also be asking the finance minister Captain Abhimanyu to devise a strategy to make Haryana debt free by generating Rs 150 lakh crore. Jaihind said that the Gangajal will also be sent to the BJP MP from Kurukshetra Raj Kumar Saini so that he may desist from spewing venom against the Jat community. Also on radar of AAP are the Jat leader Yash Pal Malik and the top leadership of INLD and the Congress.

175,Akash Bisht,"  In the past few months, there have been multiple news reports in the media suggesting how Prime Minister   might advance the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to coincide with three state Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh and Rajasthan. The ruling dispensation, including Modi, has been aggressively batting for 'One Nation, One Election' claiming how it would save valuable resources. In fact, the Law Commission of India has already held meetings with national and regional political parties seeking their suggestions on the same. Experts argue that advancing the General Elections might be a good idea considering all three states that go to polls in late December or early January are BJP-ruled states. According to them, a loss in even one the states would give Congress the much needed boost before the final battle in 2019. These three states will witness a bipolar contest between the Congress and the BJP. However, sources have informed that Modi, Shah and the RSS may not be so forthcoming about the idea of advancing the polls considering Kumbh Mela 2019 is going to be held in Allahabad from 14 January to 4 March 2019. According to sources, the BJP and the RSS are planning to use the world's largest gathering of Hindus as an occasion to launch the BJP's 2019 campaign. According to an RSS functionary from UP, “Party strategists are of the opinion that the Kumbh Mela should be used to to spread the message of wonderful initiatives taken by Modi. The gathering would also help in tiding over the anti-incumbency wave against the Adityanath government in the state. It is a Hindu festival and the party will use it to convey the message of BJP being the only choice of Hindus.” In 2014, NDA won 73 seats out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state but the recent losses in three Lok Sabha by-polls have rattled the BJP. Even the coming together of the   and the Bahujan Samaj Party has made the saffron party jittery which is now planning to use the Hindutva card to appeal to the voters to ensure a repeat of 2014 and Kumbh Mela seems to offer the perfect platform. Moreover, multiple reports suggest that Modi and his office will personally oversee the preparations of the 50-day jamboree and the prime minister might even visit Allahabad to take stock of the situation. “So, if polls were to be held early, why would Modi and his office care about the Kumbh Mela so much? Well aware of how Kumbh is attended by lakhs of devotees from across the country, he will use this occasion to yet again hard-sell himself and his government. So there is no question of advancing the polls,” the functionary said. The last time a prime minister was personally involved in overseeing Kumbh preparations dates back to 1954 when the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru kept tab on all preparations. Apparently, Nehru's popularity soared because of his involvement. With Kumbh Mela and General Elections being held in the same year, Modi government would turn it into a grand event to make a strong appeal to his core constituency of Hindus. Interestingly, even the Opposition parties are gearing themselves for the possibility of early Lok Sabha elections and have put in place mechanisms to ensure that they are not taken by surprise even if it is done. Congress vice-president is holding meetings with state leaders and asking them to be prepared for such a possibility. In addition, the 2019 Kumbh Mela would also witness a Dalit sanyasi being designated as Juna Akhara's Mahamandaleshwar. It is for the time in history that Juna Akhara – largest order of sadhus in India – will appoint a dalit in the most prominent position. Ever since 2014, BJP has been trying to woo the multiple akharas, particularly Dalit saints, in order to consolidate the lower caste vote base in the state.",2018-08-06,, Early LS polls unlikely: Modi to use Kumbh Mela to launch 2019 campaign | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/early-ls-polls-unlikely-modi-to-use-kumbh-mela-to-launch-2019-campaign-126522.html
176,Speed News Desk,"While ruling on the petitions challenging the blanket ban on Jantar Mantar and the illegal perpetual imposition of Section 144 on most of New Delhi, the Supreme Court said that “The right to protest is, thus, recognised as a fundamental right under the Constitution. This right is crucial in a democracy which rests on participation of an informed citizenry in governance. This right is also crucial since it strengthens representative democracy by enabling direct participation in public affairs where individuals and groups are able to express dissent and grievances, expose the flaws in governance and demand accountability from State authorities as well a powerful entities. This right is crucial in a vibrant democracy like India but more so in the Indian context to aid in the assertion of the rights of the marginalised and poorly represented minorities.” This is an important concession on the fundamental right to protest as a part of Article 19(1) a & b of the Constitution. It is therefore a critical judgement and affirms the chapter on fundamental rights which has always protected violation of citizens’ democratic interests across the board. There have been a series of restrictions and violations of free speech and expression. The audacity of the establishment is apparent in the steady planned encouragement of these erosions of a critical fundamental right, with the definite purpose of weakening the Constitution and the voice of people. That is why people from all sectors-- writers, playwrights, film makers, philosophers, political thinkers, students, academic institutions, political dissenters and many more who have the ear of the people— have been threatened by anti-social elements  and the government has kept very quiet. The attack on the use of public space followed as the final stroke in a series of anti-democratic restrictions. Steadily and systematically the space of protest began shrinking and this government did the ultimate in supporting the declaration  that such places would be banned.  The right to freedom of expression anchors all other rights. Without the right to speak, demonstrate, protest and dissent, how will people in a democracy present a critique of unconstitutional and anti-democratic governance and the violation of the rule of law, social violence and discrimination, and violence?  In opening up both Boat Club and Jantar Mantar the Supreme Court reaffirms that the right to peaceful protest is a cherished fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution. This assertion is of even greater significance in the current environment where critical voices are being silenced. In the Court’s own words, “Legitimate dissent is a distinguishable feature of any democracy.” However, the judgment falls short of providing effective remedy against the executive power in imposing Section 144 restrictions on the rights of peaceful assemblies. The Court has directed police authorities to frame guidelines for peaceful demonstrations, while the same authorities have been responsible for imposing excessive restrictions. The core question related to the perpetual and illegal imposition of Section 144 in Central Delhi still remains.  In the order, it is obvious that it gives us restricted and regulated access. There are rules and regulations which the police will frame--to  decide, whether the protest is  “innocuous” enough. “The underlying message is that certain categories of  peaceful protests and demonstrations, in a guarded and regulated manner, could be allowed so as to enable the protestors to exercise their right and, at the same time, ensuring that no inconvenience of any kind is caused to the residents.” The Supreme Court’s judgment reiterates once more that the right to protest is an intrinsic part of the fundamental right to freedom of peaceful assembly. It is now the duty of the government to ensure that these rights are protected.  There is a difference between the State and an elected government. This government is undermining the Constitution which in fact defines the state, and directs government action. The constitutional guarantees are crucial in a country where basic promises of freedom remain a dream, and where corruption and arbitrary use of power make a mockery of the governance. Amendments to the Constitution and the law invite protest and uproar from people who do not want the changes. If the Central Government steadily undermines these rights, it could and it does change the nature of the state. The state has to remain within the constitutional framework of a democratic republic. Weakening the constitution and the framework of justice in the conception of the state is dangerous. Public protest is sacrosanct, particularly in a country which is victim to all kinds of discrimination, as both a tool and a monitor of the health of the Republic.There was jubilant celebration a fortnight back  when the Supreme Court  pronounced an order  that the ban imposed by the National Green Tribunal(NGT)on protests and demonstrations outside Jantar Mantar, New Delhi would be lifted; that there could not be a blanket restriction on citizens right to assemble and protest peacefully. It  also allowed demonstrations at the Boat Club, restricted to protestors since the 1990s. Boat Club, and later Jantar Mantar have been important sites of innumerable protests and sit-ins, emerging as established spaces for expression of dissent and free speech.

178,Charu Kartikeya,"The defeat in the election of the deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha appears to be a result of the Opposition camp’s own making. It was a close contest and victory could have been ensured with careful planning and pragmatic strategy. However, the Congress-led Opposition failed to grasp the gravity of the situation and act in time. NDA nominee,   (United)'s Harivansh, emerged victorious, winning 125 votes. Opposition nominee, BK Hariprasad of the Congress, got 105 votes. The 20-vote margin included three from the Aam Aadmi Party ( ), two from YSR Congress and two from  's People's Democratic Party (PDP), who abstained from voting. Their reasons: The PDP said the United Progressive Alliance did not approach it to vote for its candidate, The AAP had said it wanted Congress President   to call up party chief   and YSRCP said it wanted the Opposition to field a non-Congress candidate. But for the Congress’ adamance, these were not particularly harsh demands. Accommodation would have also signalled the way forward for Opposition unity for the Lok Sabha polls. With 50 Congress members, 13 each of Trinamool Congress and the  , six of the Telugu Desam Party, five each of Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), four each of Dravida Munnetra Khazagam, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Nationalist Congress Party, two of the Communist Party of India, at least two independents and one each of Indian National Lok Dal, Muslim League, Janata Dal (Secular) and Kerala Congress (Mani), the Opposition camp would have easily got 112 votes of its own. Add the seven votes held by the three abstaining parties and the tally could have gone up to 119, very close to the magic number of 123 required to win. As the largest party in the Opposition, the Congress will have to take the blame for this defeat. It is actually surprising why the party didn’t fight harder to retain the post that has been with it for over four decades. Was a phone call to Kejriwal or Mufti too steep a price? To win over YSRCP, it could have fielded a non-Congress candidate. The party would have lost the post but its camp could have won it.

179,Rajeev Khanna,"Former Prime Minister and   (BJP) stalwart is no more and, going with the times, most media outlets are leaving no stone unturned to to make a God of him. Undoubtedly, he was a leader of tall stature, the like of whom does not exist among the current lot. His contributions to the nation can be left to the history and the people to judge. But while writing his obituary it needs to be kept in mind how people and communities looked at him. This reporter will try to bring out this aspect from some of the areas he covered as he tried to gather insights into Vajpayee's personality. Let's start with hilly Himachal Pradesh, the state the deceased PM referred to as his “second home”. His annual sojourns at Prini village near Manali in Kullu district are fondly remembered by the people of the state. After all, he belonged to that rare breed of politicians who, while holding the top office, would agree to be a chief guest at the annual day of a primary school in a neighbouring village. The chief guests at such functions are normally Tehsildars and village Pradhans. Vajpayee had obliged those present at the function by reciting a couple of his poems: While humbly saying, “  (I am not a poet).” He had instead laid stress on regaling them with anecdotes from his past. “What stood out was the fact that the children and the common people present saw him more as a prominent tall personality than a man holding the powerful post of the prime minister,” said a senior journalist who covered three of Vajpayee's Prini sojourns. “The people felt at ease with him and even transgressed the lines to ask him personal questions. He would not disappoint them. Once someone asked him whether he would return as the Prime Minister after 2004 Lok Sabha elections and he had replied with humour that the question was as hypothetical as his getting married,” he narrated. He recalls how Vajpayee had used his trade mark style to confess that Gujarat riots had been a major cause for BJP's defeat in the 2004 polls. “We had asked him about the impact of Gujarat on results and he replied in his trademark style ' ' (The only impact was that we lost he polls),” he said. On one occasion Vajpayee gave a story to the Press by taking his family for a meal at an Italian restaurant at Manali specialising in pizzas. It was a time when most leaders of his party were ranting about the Italian origins of the then-Congress President  . People of Himachal and Uttarakhand will always remember Vajpayee for the special economic package that saw arrival of industry on a large scale thus providing them both with revenue as well as employment opportunities.  Uttarakhand was carved out as a new state, along with Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, under his regime. People remember him for helping them realise their dream of a hill state; although it is a different matter that successive governments and bureaucrats have made a complete mess of things there. Another unique gift that he gave to the hill state was restoration of the Naini Lake in Nainital that is the economic life line of the local community. The gift was unique in a way that it involved pumping of oxygen under water so that the aqua life could survive. It was only after the intervention of the Supreme Court that the Lake Development Authority (LDA) had started taking pro active measures to conserve the fragile ecology of the town. But there are communities that have their reservations about Vajpayee while not denying that he was a towering leader. In Punjab, organisations like Dal Khalsa have “bitter” memories of his attitude and role towards Sikhs. “The moment his name comes in our mind, it reminds us how he led BJP protesters on 3 May, 1984 in Delhi, pressing the then central government to send the Indian army to 'liberate the Golden Temple from anti-national people' as claimed and written by his closest colleague LK Advani in his book,” Dal Khalsa leader Kanwarpal Singh said. “Vajpayee’s name also reminds us that after the Army attack in June 1984, when he visited Amritsar that August, he justified the assault and rubbed salt on our wounds by saying 'this attack should have happened six months ago',” Singh added. According to him: “In 1999, during the tercentenary celebrations of Khalsa Panth, as Prime Minister, he released Rs 100 crore to the RSS to penetrate into Sikh rank and file under the pretext of the celebrations. With that huge amount at its disposal, the RSS unleashed cultural terrorism against Sikhs through various means and ways.” He was also critical of Vajpayee's role in the context of the anti-Muslim pogrom in Gujarat.  At the same time, few remember that Vajpayee reportedly made a last-ditch effort to save former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassin Kehar Singh from the gallows. Gujarat is another state where the Muslim community – the victim of the 2002 riots following the Godhra carnage – along with social activists and people believing in diversity and pluralism have their reservations about him. The sentiment among these communities is that despite the 'Raj Dharma' rebuke at the then CM Modi on the handling of situation after the Godhra train burning episode, Vajpayee did not ensure that the 'Raj Dharma' was demonstrated on the ground. A social media post that is being circulated about Vajpayee's role says, “He came, he saw, he concurred.” When Vajpayee inaugurated the Ahmedabad Vadodara Express Highway, the first stretch of the ambitious Golden Quadrilateral Project at Narol in January 2003, he had said the-then American President George Bush was not going in the right direction as America prepared for the Iraq invasion. The local Muslim population had smirked, saying that while he could not get his own party chief minister to prevent the killings in Gujarat, he was asking American President not to invade Iraq. This reporter recalls how on 13 January, 2004, Vajpayee in a late-evening address at the GMDC Grounds in Ahmedabd had again used his trade mark style to woo the Muslim community ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. Having talked of various things he suddenly came up with his trademark pause before saying what had happened was wrong and after another pause ' ' (They should forgive). In his ambiguous trademark style he had sought an apology from the victim community. He had then gone on to inaugurate a state-of-the-art hospital in Bhuj that was built with funds from his his office after the Bhuj earthquake of 2001. At this event in Bhuj, Modi had broken down while underlining how much Vajpayee had meant for him. ",2018-08-20,, Bittersweet PM: The memories of Vajpayee  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/pov/bittersweet-pm-the-memories-of-vajpayee-128771.html
180,Anurag Dey,"Speaking in the same vein, his colleague Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the decision was a punishment by the government for Justice Joseph: The Congress also took to twitter to express its anguish over the decision: However, there are others who have held the decision to administer oath last to Justice Joseph contending that the other two judges were senior to him as high court judges.  International Council of Jurists President Adish C Aggarwala said the government was justified in naming Justice Joseph as the third and last judge in the swearing in list. “Just because his name was recommended by the collegium earlier doesn’t means he becomes senior to other two judges. While Justice Banerjee was appointed a high court judge on 5 February, 2002 and Justice Saran on 14 February, 2002, Justice Joseph made it to the high court only on 14 October, 2004. The other two judges are fairly senior to him and administering oath to Justice Joseph first would have been a gross injustice to the other two,” Aggarwala told Catch. Former Delhi High Court judge Justice SN Dhingra too said it was appropriate that Justice Joseph was administered the oath in the last: “Seniority as a high court judge is what matters and in that respect both Justice Banerjee and Justice Saran are senior to Justice Jospeh. Just because you are a favourite of the collegiums or your name was recommended earlier doesn’t mean you can undermine that seniority. Administering oath to Justice Joseph in the last was the apt thing to do,” Justice Dhingra told  . With the elevation of the three new judges, the apex court judges strength has now gone up to 28 (against a sanctioned strength of 31). Also, for the first time the Supreme Court has three sitting women judges – Justices R Banumathi, Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee.Amid a raging debate over being “downgraded”, Justice KM Joseph Tuesday was sworn in as the junior-most judge in the Supreme Court. He arguably ruffled quite a few feathers within the  , in power at the Centre, when he quashed President's Rule in Uttarakhand iin 2016. Notwithstanding the anguish expressed by many, including several SC judges, Justice Joseph was administered the oath of office by Chief Justice Dipak Misra at a function in the apex court, following Justices Indira Banerjee and Vineet Saran. This order of seniority was the same as notified by the government in its Warrant of Appointment, which had prompted many to claim the   government was “undermining of his seniority”. it rejected the SC Collegium’s recommendation to elevate Justice Joseph as a judge of the apex court. Justice Joseph, the longest-serving chief justice of any high court was recommended by the Collegium in January. But the Centre after sitting over the recommendations for a considerable time, in July asked the collegium for reconsideration citing among other reasons his rank (45th) in the overall seniority list of high court judges. The Centre’s delayed response and sending the recommendation for reconsideration had irked the collegium members, including Justices J Chelameswar (since retired), Kurian Joseph and MB Lokur, who had expressed their anguish to Chief Justice Dipak Misra over the issue. Only after the collegium reiterated in July its recommendation to elevate Justice Joseph along with chief justice of Madras High Court Indira Banerjee and chief justice of Odisha High Court Vineet Saran as Supreme Court judges, that the Centre relented and accepted the recommendations. However, Centre put Justice Joseph’s name in third position after the other two judges in the order of appointment leading many to cry foul. Following the issue of the order of appointment several apex court judges went to CJI Misra seeking Justice Joseph be administered oath ahead of the other two judges as his name recommended much earlier than the other two judges. But on Tuesday there was no change in the order of the swearing in and Justice Jospeh took oath as the junior most judge of the apex court. The Centre has defended the decision insisting that both Justice Banerjee and Justice Saran were senior to Justice Joseph as high court judges. The order of the swearing-in prompted the Congress to smell “vindictiveness” by the BJP government.

181,Pradeep Narayanan,"One cannot live for 95 years, of which more than 70 years was in active partisan politics, and yet not be disliked by most people, if not everyone. Being in active politics, one would have taken innumerable political stands and with every new one, would have made new enemies. Further, for every political compromise one would have made for getting to power, there would be ten times those to sustain power. And then, his longevity would leave him struggling to list even one principle that he preached and did not violate at least once in his life. Yet, history could never be able to ignore him easily, simply because for most of the era when he had power, there were no better role models anyway. That is Karunanidhi!  With him ended the glorious era of Dravidian Troika - with Periyar and Annadurai. The three presided over probably the only successful social transformation, which owes to a socio-political movement, and resulted in even usurping of power by the then marginalised section through a political process acknowledged as democracy. Karunanidhi was way older than he was- at any point of his life. His intellectual grasp over social concepts and sarcastic retorts that are grounded in the realities made even his peers regard him as an old wise man. He was never young for any generation of youths. A generation of youth saw in him an experienced political and progressive artist; the next one called him a revolutionary leader; the subsequent one saw themselves as his benefactor; and some among the current youth saw in him a sentinel- to ward off any attempt to revive any brahmanical narrative that the troika always fought against. The Dravidian movement, the first time, successfully used people’s mobilisation to win electoral power for a marginalised community. It displaced a system that perpetuated one minuscule sections’ dominance over policy-making spaces so much that the knowledge system around that power structure created a narrative that such kind of knowledge-based caste hierarchy is legitimate. The concept of merit, pedigree, hygiene, non-violence, karma - were all instruments that legitimated the illegitimate dominance of the so-called top most ladder of caste system. The inequality was so ingrained in the culture and society, that it produced a polity of inequity very legitimately. And this polity controlled the culture and this culture controlled the polity - and together they perpetuated an unequal system, but in a very organic way. Knowledge was the power and also the instrument to legitimise the illegitimate power-at the same time. A hundred years ago, in 1919, out of 128 district munsifs, 93 were Brahmins: 609 out of 1007 gazettes posts were held by Brahmins; 9813 out of 17225 clerks were Brahmins; and not a single non-Brahmin was elected to the Legislative Council between 1887 and 1917. In 1914, of 650 registered graduates of Madras University, 464 were Hindus, and among them only 11 were non-Brahmin Hindus. This is the context to the Dravidian movement, which began as the Justice Party. The point was to bring justice - a section that has population of 3 to 4 percent cannot occupy most of the policy-making, implementing and influencing space. And while the reservation for non-Brahmins began as early as 1920s, the struggle was to use the political space to then influence socio-cultural and religious spaces, which continues even today. And Karunanidhi and his struggle needs to be located within that space of dissent and protest, where being in power does not matter. More than the persistence, the Dravidian movement demonstrated the tactical acumen of the troika. A general statement about Tamil Nadu - cinema influences its politics - hides the way the politics of Annadurai and Karunanidhi instrumentalised Tamil cinema. Culture was an important cockpit space, and in cinema, they saw the amalgam of popular culture and popular mobilisation. Annadurai’s Vellaikaari and Or Iravu and Karunanidhi’s Parasakthi, Mandhirikumari and Thangarathnam set the tone for the movement’s influence over Tamil cinema. Karunanidhi promoted rationalist ideas and encouraged viewers to question everything. In Naam, he writes, “there is not much difference between a sickle and a question mark”. MGR’s screen dialogue is penned by Karunanidhi! Cinema was instrumental in educating masses. It took the form of student movements, cultural movements, social movements, political struggles, mass movement. You think of anything - it had characteristics of everything that is considered as progressive. One can easily infer that the Dravidian movement underestimated the caste system. Democratisation of political space stopped with displacing Brahmins from certain political spaces. Brahminism was understood narrowly, ignoring that for thousands of years, Brahminism percolated at every level of caste relationships. That the relationship between Tamil Shudras (dravidas) and Adidravidas would also be brahmanical for the relationship is in the end a byproduct of the Brahmanical caste system - was not something unknown to the troika, but their inability to create sequential successive movements stopped at a new socio-political relationship, which may not be less brahmanical than what it displaced. It was not that the need for a continued struggle was never felt, but it just stopped! Where did it falter? Firstly, the dynamics of capturing political power and sustaining political power are different. The agitators, who together built the movement, post the conquest of political power, rewarded themselves with positions - and they rested. The struggle stopped. Secondly, progressive politics became a victim of its own instruments, which legitimised power not because of ideology but because of its strength as mobiliser. Cinema as a medium to mobilise people won over it being the instrument to promote ideology, for the people were not fully prepared to stand up for the ideology. People never understood that ideology demands overhaul of power structure, which would not necessarily be comfortable for them. That a Dravidian ideology could produce MGR or Jayalalitha as its leaders - is the victory of the instrument over the ideology. While it will be unfair to dismiss Karunanidhi because of his many wrong doings, it will also be unfair not to say that Karunanidhi, in the end, did fail the movement. He will probably never be forgiven for converting an ideology-based political party that he inherited from Annadurai, into a corrupt personal fiefdom. For that crime, an Annadurai and a Periyar would never give him a space alongside their cemeteries, but his life is definitely more than these. And then, Karunanidhi, the social reformer, should refuse to die!",2018-08-07,," Karunanidhi: Sun sets, but a reformer never dies | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/sun-sets-but-a-reformer-never-dies-126821.html
182,Saba Naqvi,"(Page 16-18) Was Vajpayee really opposed to the Ram temple movement? I believe at some level there was a genuine revulsion, perhaps even aesthetic, in the way things were panning out around the mandir–masjid. I remember following him to Surat in Gujarat during the campaign trail. One day, even as he stepped out of his car, a volunteer who appeared to be in a state of frenzy, began shouting, ‘Jai Shri Ram’ (Hail, Shri Ram). I vividly recall Vajpayee turning around and snapping rather poetically, ‘Bolte raho Jai Shri Ram; aur karo mat koi kaam!’ (Keep shouting Jai Shri Ram; do little else)! It was one of those Vajpayee moments I shall always remember. Around the same time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee granted me an interview, which was published in India Today magazine where I then worked, as part of one of the first cover stories I wrote on the BJP. We spoke about many things, but the major thrust of the interview was that he wished to separate the BJP from RSS. ‘It is ridiculous to say that the BJP would be remote controlled by the RSS. The RSS has views of its own. The BJP has views of its own. And the BJP is adjusting to a more real situation.’ Another memory from the 1998 campaign is of the time when a reporter asked the BJP’s prime minister-designate point-blank (which seems impossible to do these days) what if his party lost the elections. Unfazed, and with a twinkle in his eyes, Vajpayee had retorted, ‘Then it will be agli bari, Atal Bihari’ (The next time over, Atal Bihari Vajpayee; the campaign slogan in 1998 was, Abki bari Atal Bihari, this time around, it’s Atal Bihari). It was this self-deprecating humour in Hindi that made the man stand out among conventional politicians. On 4 December 1997, the then President of India, K. R. Narayanan dissolved the 11th Lok Sabha. There was a certain irony in the fact that it coincided with the BJP holding its first all-India Muslim Youth Conference at a stadium in Delhi. Vajpayee couldn’t resist cracking a joke even on that day—‘People may suggest that we have an understanding with the President to dissolve the Lok Sabha on the day we have our first Muslim conference.’ I remember being told by party cadre how they had instructions not to raise the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan. Naturally, I attended the event and was quite amused to see silence on Ram, but leader after leader going up on stage and reciting Urdu couplets, showering praises on Muslim heroes, many I hadn’t even ever heard of.   proceeded to give examples of India’s composite culture: he spoke of Hindus visiting Sufi shrines, and Meo Muslims.* K. R. Malkani, veteran Jana Sangh leader, who at that time headed the Deendayal Research Institute, came up with two gems which I dutifully noted in my reporter’s notebook—‘Ram–Rahim ek hain, Krishna–Kaaba ek hain,’ (Ram and Rahim, as Krishna and Kaaba are one and the same), he said in the spirit of oneness. But the very next line had prompted Atalji to stare at Malkani, who said, ‘No Muslim will oppose Atalji even if he stands from Islamabad.’ However, the news point for me that day was a significant statement by L. K. Advani who appealed to Muslims to give up their claim on the Babri masjid in Ayodhya, while assuring them that he would personally negotiate with the VHP to find a settlement to the Kashi and Mathura disputes. In 1998, Atal Bihari Vajpayee traversed the country making meaningful speeches about swasthya, shiksha and suraksha (health, education and security). He openly admitted to being irritated by questions about the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Uniform Civil Code, or the revival of the Hindu rashtra. Even occasional queries about Kashi and Mathura would irk him no end, and he would choose to keep silent. However, it was also true that the building of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya was a core issue that the BJP couldn’t afford to ignore, as it had contributed to its great electoral leap in 1991. Vajpayee therefore made a subtle change in tack and said that it was no longer necessary for a BJP government to enact a legislation to build a temple at Ayodhya. ‘We will resolve the issue through dialogue—the same way we resolved the Azadari dispute between the Shias and Sunnis of Lucknow. A law will not be needed.’  Lord Ram could never be jettisoned by the BJP. There were other voices like that of Kushabhau Thakre, who later became party president—‘Can anyone think about India without Ram?’ he once asked me, but added with utmost honesty that, ‘We can only implement our ideology if we have the strength to do so.  ’ (All this is on our agenda but we lack the strength to pursue it).’ That was a euphemism for saying that their ideology will not be jettisoned, but only deferred for some more time. This shall be said many times over in the book—Vajpayee was different from the run-of-the-mill RSS worker because he perceived politics as an art of the possible. It wasn’t as if he wasn’t close to the Sangh Parivar, it was rather well known that he enjoyed a great rapport with the then RSS sarsanghchalak (supreme leader or chief), Rajju Bhaiya. That said, Vajpayee also had some contempt for those in public life who did not have the ability to win elections. He was always more comfortable in the company of former Rajasthan chief minister, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Jaswant Singh and, later, Pramod Mahajan, all traditional politicians. One of his famous retorts to the ‘mukhauta’ controversy, hinted at his impatience towards back-room organisers such as Govind. ‘I must be enjoying the full confidence of the party or else I would never have been bestowed with the highest honour of being the prime ministerial candidate.’  Yet, among the hard-liners, Vajpayee did not come out tops. Sadhvi Rithambara, notorious for her venom-spewing remarks about Muslims during the Ram janmabhoomi movement, described him as, ‘half a Congressman’; while the then chief of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the late Ashok Singhal, was barely on talking terms with him. As far as the Advani–Vajpayee relationship was concerned, it had layers of complexities. On the one hand, there was mutual respect based on long-standing friendship and association. Advani, typically like several RSS functionaries was adept at handling the nitty-gritty of organisational matters—something Vajpayee had no patience for. But once Vajpayee settled into the prime ministership, the question about who was more powerful remained unanswered. Advani because he had greater party and RSS backing? Or Vajpayee because he had greater mass appeal? It was the clear-headed Advani who would describe what the BJP was going through as, ‘The transformation of an ideological movement to a mass-based party. That is why there are hiccups at every stage. Take the recent agonising over the party’s manifesto. While a manifesto may be so much waste paper for most political parties, every small nuance is pored over in the BJP.’ In sum, by the time of the swearing-in ceremony on 19 March 1998, the BJP had shown far greater flexibility than it was credited with having. The umbilical cord to the RSS had not been cut, yet the Vajpayee facade was instrumental in convincing several parties to go along with the BJP. Vajpayee himself said quite artfully, ‘Sometimes circumstances may have forced us to take a hard line. But the BJP has always been a moderate party.’ There’s no denying that putting the NDA together required deft work and it revealed the political intelligence of both Advani and Vajpayee. Ironically, it was during the 1998 campaign trail that Vajpayee would frequently attack the United Front (UF) coalition (that got outside support from the Congress party) for lack of ideological clarity with lines such as, ‘Kahin ka eent, kahin ka roda, Bhanumati ne kunba joda’ (A brick from here, a brick from there, that’s how Bhanumati got her flock together). The BJP had done pretty much the same, but the difference was that they would make it work. As for the Govindacharya issue, Vajpayee would eventually deal with it with a sense of humour. There was a point when he stopped referring to Govind by his name, and would privately tell members of his inner circle how ‘Rajneeshacharya’ (reference to a godman with a large following) did this or that. Apparently, once Vajpayee genuinely forgot his name and referred to him as ‘Dronacharya’!Shades of Saffron -- from Vajpayee to Modi",2018-08-17,," Mandir, mask and the man: Vajpayee in the reporter's eye | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/mandir-mask-and-the-man-vajpayee-in-the-reporter-s-eye-128341.html
183,Catch Team,"Politicians from across the spectrum paid their respect to the leader, who served as Tamil Nadu's five separate terms and never lost an election. Leading them was Prime Minister  . As a script writer he would have lived a life of obscurity in the shadows of film stars who enjoy cult status in Tamil Nadu. But sharp-tongued, quick-witted M Karunanidhi had other plans. He outshone many a celebrity, as he presided over the destiny of the Dravidian state along with his tinsel town co-travellers and arch rivals in politics -- MG Ramachandran and his protegee J   -- for decades.  That art and politics blended seamlessly in Karunanidhi was manifest from the sobriquets of 'Thalaivar' (The Leader) and 'Kalaignar' (The Artist) he earned from ardent followers. A masterful practitioner of modern-day politics, he wielded considerable influence beyond his own state, in the corridors of power in New Delhi, for a long time, sewing up alliances with both the Congress and the BJP, often drawing criticism from his rivals, who called him an opportunist. Muthuvel Karunanidhi, who became the chief minister five times, cut his teeth in politics as a 14-year-old when he participated in the anti-Hindi agitation in 1938 at his native Tiruvarur. Hugely influenced by the rationalist and egalitarian ideology of EV Ramasamy 'Periyar' and DMK founder and the state's first chief minister CN Annadurai, Karunanidhi became one of the most enduring mascots of the Dravidian Movement, which aimed at seeking equal rights for the depressed sections and women, and was against Brahminism. Elected to the Legislative Assembly 13 times, Karunanidhi, a political artiste, outmanoeuvred VR Nedunchezhian to become the chief minister for the first time following the death of Annadurai in February 1969. MG Ramachandran, his junior and one of the most charismatic actors of his time, supported Karunanidhi in his endeavour to edge past Nedunchezhian, who was the number two in the Annadurai cabinet. Years later, the two were to part ways, with MGR, as Ramachandran was popularly called, forming the  , the party which was to become a perennial thorn in Karunanidhi's side.  Karunanidhi was a legislator for six decades since 1957, when he won for the first time from Kulithalai constituency, till 2016, when he emerged victorious from Tiruvarur as a 92-year-old, barring the period between 1986 and 1989.  In 1984, he was elected to the Legislative Council, which was abolished by the MGR government in 1986. He had resigned as MLA in 1983 over the Srilankan Tamils issue.  After assuming the reins of the government, Karunanidhi became the DMK chief in July 1969, a post that he held till death.  He again became the chief minister in 1971, 1989, 1996 and 2006. When he lost power to friend-turned-foe MGR's protegee Jayalalithaa in 2011, he famously quipped ""people have given me some rest"".  Addressed as Mu Ka, Tamil abbreviation of his name, by his peers, Karunanidhi's letters to DMK cadres in party mouthpiece Murasoli and his autobiography-cum-commentary on contemporary politics Nenjukku Needhi, are the favourite reading material for his supporters.  Karunanidhi's famous line ""  (my dear brothers in party who are are above my life),"" in his unmistakable baritone, used to send DMK workers into raptures Alongside Annadurai, who also had film and theatre background, Karunanidhi used the medium for furthering his political ideology Incidentally, the screenplay and dialogue for MGR's debut movie as hero 'Rajakumari' was written by him. He also wrote the dialogues for 'Parasakthi', the debut film of another tinsel town icon Sivaji Ganesan. The movie propagated the socialist and rationalist ideals of the Dravidian Movement.  While MGR rose to become one of the most popular public figures in Tamil Nadu's history, Ganesan dabbled in politics but faded from the scene quickly.  Karunanidhi penned screenplays and dialogues for over 50 movies. He also wrote the stories of some of them like Marudanattu Ilavarasi (1950) Mandiri Kumari (1950), Tirumbipar (1953), Arasilangkumari (1961).  A big political jolt for Karunanidhi came when MGR rebelled against him in 1972, accusing him of corruption and demanding details of the party's finances. MGR was expelled from the party the same year, and he floated the AIADMK, an event that marked the advent of bipolar politics in Tamil Nadu.  MGR led AIADMK to victory in the party's debut Assembly polls in 1977, and in 1980 and 1985. He was the chief minister till his death in 1987, forcing Karunanidhi to cool his heels in the opposition as long as he helmed the state.  Karunanidhi was back in power in 1989, only to lose to J Jayalalithaa, MGR's protegee, in 1991. He led DMK to victory in 1996, but AIADMK under Jayalalithaa trumped his party once again in 2001.  The Thalaivar struck back, wresting power from her in 2006, but the DMK lost successive Assembly polls in 2011 and 2015 to the AIADMK under a charismatic Jayalalithaa.  Proving true the adage that there are no permanent friends or foes in politics, Karunanidhi, who denounced the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi in 1975, formed alliances with the Congress several times, and the UPA government had several ministers from the DMK. The DMK was also a constituent of the BJP-led NDA and had ministers in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Cabinet.  The DMK had walked out of the UPA 2 in 2013 over its ""soft stand"" on the atrocities on Sri Lankan Tamils in the United Nations.  The Dravidian party wanted a strongly worded resolution to be passed at the United Nations Human Rights Council, with inclusion of expressions like ""genocide"" and ""war crimes"", while seeking an international probe against Sri Lanka over persecution of Tamils in that country.  The UPA government, however, survived with the outside support of the   and  's  .  Karunanidhi suffered a personal jolt when his MP daughter Kanimozhi got embroiled in the 2G spectrum scam along with union minister and DMK leader A Raja.  In 1980, when he joined hands with the Congress, he exuded warmth for Indira Gandhi with his remark, ""  (welcome, the daughter of Nehru, give us good governance).""  The comment encapsulated the intrinsic resilience of the master political craftsman who saw opportunity in every adversity. - Muthuvel Karunanidhi died Tuesday evening, drawing to close an era in Indian politics. He was 94. Popularly known as 'Kalaignar' – the artist – Karunanidhi was one of the tallest leaders in Indian politics, one of the stewards of the Dravidian self-respect movement, and at the same time, an important contributor to Tamil popular culture.  Thousands hit the streets in Chennai after Kauvery Hospital, where the veteran leader was being treated, announced that he died at 6:10 pm.",2018-08-07,, End of an era: 'Kalaignar' Karunanidhi dies | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/end-of-an-era-kalaignar-karunanidhi-dies-126815.html
184,Sulagna Sengupta," president   intensified his attack on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on the issue of the National Register of Citizens.  Addressing a rally at Mayo Road in Kolkata, he accused Banerjee of playing vote-bank politics and having a hypocritical stand on illegal immigration.  “I want to ask Didi one question. Why do you want to keep illegal immigrants in Bengal? In 2005, when you were the sole Trinamool member in Parliament, you demanded a discussion in the House on infiltration of Bangladeshis in India. When the Speaker did not allow it, you threw the papers on the table and left the House in a huff. Now Banerjee is opposing NRC . She is trying to protect and shield Bangaldeshi immigrants for vote-bank politics.” He further added, ""The BJP cannot sacrifice the internal security of the country for the sake of vote-bank politics”. He claimed that the BJP will uproot the Trinamool Congress from Bengal and it is targeting 22 out of 42 next year's Lok Sabha elections”. According to Shah, the NRC list is the best way to identify and throw out illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. He further said that the NDA government is trying to bring a Citizenship Amendment Bill to provide citizenship to Hindu migrants from neighbouring countries.  “I am asking both AITC and Congress a question. Will they support the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016 that will be placed in the Parliament? Both political parties need to clear their stand before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress has already opposed the Citizenship Amendment Bill. If they oppose the Citizenship Amendment Bill, why are both the parties opposing the NRC?” Shah mentioned. The BJP president further accused the Trinamool Congress government of being run  by a ""family syndicate"". Trying to bring in the communal angle, Shah refered to the restrictions that the the West Bengal government had imposed on the idol immersion during Durga Puja last year.  “Once we come to power, people can celebrate Durga Puja without any worry and we will not indulge in appeasement politics,” he said.  Shah also claimed that all Bengali news channels have been blacked out by the state government to stop his voice from reaching the people. The Trinamool Congress has condemned the BJP's president's statements. The party said from its Twitter handle, ""BJP has just concluded another flop show in Bangla. They are saying that their meeting was blacked out. Blackouts and blackmailing is what BJP do. Don't insult the media . All (of them) showed (the rally).

185,Gowhar  Geelani,"  Since 1947 the Kashmir story has seen various political characters being replaced, but the script has, by and large, remained unchanged. From the arrest and unceremonious removal of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah as Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir on 9 August 1953 to the toppling of Dr. Farooq Abdullah-led government in 1984 and now to isolation of Mehbooba Mufti on 19 June 2018 after the BJP pulled out of the coalition government, Jammu and Kashmir’s history is replete with New Delhi’s machinations. The formation of PDP was a similar move by the Centre. The PDP was formed by late Mufti Mohammad Saeed a year before the National Conference passed its Autonomy Resolution in the J&K Legislative Assembly in June 2000. The NC's Autonomy Resolution had “shocked” the BJP, which was in power at the Centre at that time. Ironically, the NC was part of the BJP-led government. It is said that the Centre fostered the PDP as a counterweight to the NC in Kashmir. Strangely, the PDP is now unraveling at the Centre's behest. It remains to be seen if the BJP succeeds in splitting the party.    The People's Democratic Party (PDP) is unraveling and  's leadership of the party is in danger. Several MLAs have begun speaking against her leadership. The rebellion supposedly has the blessings of the  . After the break-up of the PDP and the BJP last month, the grapevine has it that either Sajad Lone, Altaf Bukhari, Muzaffar Beigh or Haseeb Drabu, could become Jammu & Kashmir’s next Chief Minister if the rebellion in the PDP is engineered beyond repair. What is going to happen in J&K if two-thirds of the PDP MLAs desert their party and join the ‘mutiny of sorts’ kick started by a former PDP minister Imran Reza Ansari following the break-up of the alliance? Imran Reza Ansari, MLA from north Kashmir’s Pattan constituency and a former minister in the now non-operational PDP-BJP coalition government, is widely seen as the ‘mastermind of rebellion’ within the PDP ranks. Ansari’s sentiments have been echoed by three more Members of the J&K Legislative Assembly all of whom belong to the PDP camp. “…Not just Abid Sahab (Zadibal MLA Abid Ansari) everybody is saying that many elements had intruded into our government (PDP-BJP coalition) which eventually led to its collapse. We had been repeatedly telling Mehbooba ji that she has black sheep in her party who will leave her embarrassed,” Ansari told media, adding that “the People’s Democratic Party has been transformed into a ‘Family Democratic Party’ and that is the reason people became distrustful.” Ironically, Imran Ansari himself is a beneficiary of the dynastic political background as he belongs to The Ansaris. Late Iftikhar Ansari, Imran’s father, was a politician who switched sides from the Congress to the National Conference to the PDP. “For some time now I have been telling Mehbooba ji that I am feeling choked in the party (PDP). (Hamara dum ghut raha hai iss party main). It is a party hijacked by a few individuals. And it is because of those individuals Mehbooba ji lost power,” Imran Ansari told media. Another PDP MLA from Srinagar’s Zadibal assembly constituency Abid Ansari has spoken openly against his party. Similarly, another MLA from north Kashmir’s Tangmarg assembly segment Abbas Wani has also lent his support to Imran Ansari-led revolt. The latest one to join the PDP’s rebel group is Member of Parliament Muzaffar Beigh’s nephew Javed Beigh, who is MLA from Baramulla in north Kashmir. “Those lawmakers who have shown resentment against the party leadership should not be blamed for their stand as they and several others were humiliated by the party leadership from time to time. I echo the same sentiment as shown by lawmakers like Imran Ansari,” he told the Srinagar-based English daily  . Imran, Abid, Abbas and Javed are the four PDP MLAs who have made public their displeasure against the PDP. Haseeb Drabu and Altaf Bukhari, two former PDP ministers and senior leaders, have not spoken publicly against the party but are believed to be discontented with the PDP’s top leadership. But are four-five MLAs enough to cobble up a new coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir? Will the existing anti-defection law allow that to happen? And, above all, is there a larger political design on the part of the BJP to invest in the third front formation come the next Assembly elections? Jammu and Kashmir’s former advocate general Jehangir Ganai is of the view that the anti-defection law in Jammu and Kashmir after its amendment during the previous Congress-PDP coalition government is “much tougher and stronger” than other states. To instigate irreparable division in the PDP the BJP would at least need support of 18 or more PDP MLAs. Also, it is said that if the PDP legislative party leader disqualifies the defecting MLAs, the Speaker (who belongs to the BJP) won't be able to reverse it. “There is nothing to be glad about over the manner in which some MLAs have spoken against the PDP. The party leadership will soon meet and take a view on this,” senior PDP leader Naeem Akhtar told Catch. It is no secret that the PDP is divided in multiple camps and that the fissures within the party are too deep. It seems that the BJP aims to retain its 25 seats in Hindu-dominated Jammu region by polarising the restive region on regional and religious lines. The magic number to form the government in the 87-member J&K Legislative Assembly is 44. Suppose the BJP retains its 25 seats from Jammu and wins some more in Ladakh region it would still need about 15 more from the Kashmir Valley. Can the BJP convince 15 or more MLAs from the PDP, NC and Congress to join the saffron march in the upcoming elections? Looks difficult, but politics is the art of impossible.  ",2018-07-07,, Can the BJP succeed in splitting PDP and forming a govt in J-K? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/can-the-bjp-succeed-in-splitting-pdp-and-forming-a-govt-in-j-k-121444.html
186,Anurag Dey,"Rohatgi argued that Victorian era law was irrelevant today. “Section 377 is based on the Victorian morals of 1860 as against the position in ancient India which is indicated by the existence of a character like Shikhandi in the Mahabharata and the depictions in the Khajuraho temples. “What is the order of nature in 1860 can't be the order of nature today. Whether a pre-constitutional law not framed by our Parliament and which does not recognise the needs of our people should remain in existence,” asked Rohatgi. He also questioned the judgment in the Suresh Kumar Kaushal vs Naz Foundation case in which the Supreme Court had upheld the constitutional validity of Section 377 after the Delhi High Court had decriminalised homosexuality. “The Kaushal case judgment affects the basic rights of a section of people and it has an impact on the society,” argued Rohatgi. The Delhi High Court, in July 2009 in “Naz Foundation vs Govt. of NCT of Delhi, had decriminalised consensual same-sex sexual relations between adults, holding that the provision “grossly violates homosexual individuals’ right to privacy and liberty embodied in Article 21”. It had ruled that Section 377 violated Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. While the Centre did not challenge the verdict, a host of petitions were filed in the apex court opposing the High Court judgment. Subsequently in December 2013, an Apex Court bench in the Kaushal case, reversed the High Court verdict and upheld the constitutional validity of Section 377. Later in June 2016 five LGBT community members-- Bharatnatyam exponent Navtej Singh Johar, journalist Sunil Mehra, chef, Ritu Dalmia, businesswoman Ayesha Kapur and hotelier Aman Nath filed a petition challenging section 377. They also contended that a larger constitution bench be formed to hear all petitions on the issue. In January this year a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra referred the petitions challenging the legality of Section 377 to the present Constitution Bench while observing that the apex court judgment, in the Kaushal v Naz Foundation case upholding the constitutionality of Section 377, required to be “reexamined”. The Constitution Bench that began hearing the clutch of six petitions on Tuesday, besides CJI Misra, comprises Justices AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud, RF Nariman and Indu Malhotra. The bench on Monday had rejected the Centre’s plea to defer the hearing. The Centre had sought more time to file its response. Appearing for the Centre, Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Tuesday pleaded that the petitioners should restrict their arguments only to constitutional validity of Section 377. He pleaded the court for more time to file the Centre’s reply if the arguments were beyond Section 377. The petitioners contend that their rights to sexuality, sexual autonomy, choice of sexual partner, life, privacy, dignity and equality, along with the other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, were infringed by Section 377. They have also argued that right to sexuality and the right to choice of a sexual partner are fundamental rights protected under Article 21 of the Constitution and have questioned whether section 377 is unconstitutional and violative of the Constitution and hence be struck down. As per the petitioners, the continuance of Section 377 ensures that the Constitutional guarantees of equality, fraternity, dignity, life and liberty, are not extended to them. “Section 377 criminalises a core part of a person’s identity solely on account of his or her sexuality. It denies LGBT persons, their right to full personhood, sexuality, sexual autonomy, and choice of sexual partner, which are implicit in the notion of life under Article 21 of the Constitution. Section 377 criminalises the very existence of LGBT persons by criminalising their sexuality, an attribute which is as inherent and intrinsic to a person as their race or gender. The law recognizes petitioners only as criminals and reduces their love to a crime,” states the petition. The petitioners have further stated they are unable to form professional associations with other similarly placed persons to voice their concerns about discrimination which they may face in places of employment, education, or otherwise. “The Petitioners cannot overcome a lurking fear that their consensual relationships, even within the privacy of their homes, may invite coercive state action at the hands of a busybody, rival, political party, or any other 3rd party who has no bona fide interest with the private lives of the Petitioners, and is motivated only by malice/prejudice,” stated the petition. The hearing will resume on Wednesday.The Supreme Court on Tuesday began hearing a clutch of petitions seeking scrapping of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which criminalises homosexuality in the country. The petitioners, also comprising members of LGBT community, contend that “right to sexuality” and “right to choice of a sexual partner” are fundamental rights protected under Article 21 of the Constitution. The five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra heard at length the petitioners’ counsels who argued that the ambit of hearing be not just restricted to decriminalisation of homosexuality, but should extend to declaring that rights of the LGBT community are covered under Article 21. Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi argued for scrapping of Section 377 which criminalises homosexuality and punishes “carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal”, with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term extending to ten years.",2018-07-10,, Section 377: Will SC scrap the criminalisation of homosexuality? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/section-377-will-sc-scrap-the-criminalisation-of-homosexuality-121962.html
187,Charu Kartikeya,"  The ration-delivery scheme and the fund for unauthorised colonies have similar potential for confrontation. Also to be noticed is the fact that the elected government’s strategy also appears to be to initiate a barrage of works in one go and then see which ones LG obstructs and which ones materialise. This means that the AAP sees these confrontations as a blessing in disguise, probably believing that the more they are able to tell their voters that the BJP is not letting them work through the LG, the higher the sympathy for AAP. BJP certainly believes in the opposite - the more it is able to hinder AAP, the lower its appeal goes down. Until specific spheres of control are clearly demarcated through more judicial pronouncements, no end to this tussle appears to be in sight. It looks like until that happens, all that the AAP-government can do unhindered is to hold mango festivals.  The euphoria that the Supreme Court ruling of 4 July triggered among the Aam Aadmi Party and its followers has proved to be short-lived. In less time than it may take to read the 535-page judgment, the Union government has amply demonstrated its commitment to obstructionism in Delhi, pretty much in violation of the spirit of the SC judgment. Immediately after the judgment, the elected government jumped to seize the opportunity by staking claim over the power to appoint and transfer officers. The attempt was promptly thwarted by the officers themselves with prompt and pronounced backing by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and the Union Home Ministry. MHA, in fact, has clearly indicated that this subject is still under litigation and the  -led Delhi government will either have to wait for the judgment in that case or go to the SC again. The Chief Minister and the council of ministers have rolled the dice on three other initiatives which have all the potential needed to snowball into confrontations with the LG. These include installation of CCTV cameras across the capital, doorstep delivery of PDS rations and releasing funds for development works in all temporary and unauthorised colonies. The CCTV project has already been threatened by the shadow of a committee set up by the LG to prepare SOPs for the initiative. The  -led government had already expressed its disapproval of the committee, calling it illegal. However, the committee went on its work and has now submitted its report, which appears to have prepared the ground for another tussle. The committee has reportedly   that all CCTVs will be under the control of Delhi Police, noting that the “appropriate authority” on installation, operation and monitoring of CCTVs will be the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Licensing). The Delhi Police does not report to the CM but to the MHA via the LG. This report was submitted last week, much before the SC judgment came, and if the LG wants to honour the SC’s nudge to desist from obstructionism he can very well ignore this recommendation to avoid confrontation with the elected government. However, if he accepts it and orders its implementation, that will amount to yet another clear act of locking horns with the CM.",2018-07-07,," By continuing obstructionism against AAP, LG is going against spirit of SC ruling | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/by-continuing-obstructionism-against-aap-lg-is-going-against-spirit-of-sc-ruling-121446.html
188,Rajeev Khanna,"Senior Congress leader and jail and co-operation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa hit out at the Akalis saying the SAD invited Khattar for the Malout rally and conveniently chose to forget that it was the same Haryana chief minister who had demanded Chandigarh just the previous day, a demand rejected by Amarinder. He questioned how could SAD leaders forget that Khattar has also been demanding completion of Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal which would rob Punjab of its precious water turning it into a barren land. The charges and counter charges are expected to continue. What would be of interest is whether the Akalis and the BJP can gain anything out of the MSP hike hype being generated by Modi in the coming polls.Prime Minister   got down to hard-selling the Minimum Support Price (MSP) sop offered to the farmers recently by his government at a rally in Malout in Punjab on Wednesday. One can infer from the contents of his speech and his tone and tenor that the event was the launch of his election campaign for the 2019 Lok Sabha and subsequent Haryana polls. The 'Thanksgiving' rally was organised by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and its ally in Punjab   (BJP) with the latter also bringing a sizable number of participants from neighbouring Haryana. Malout was chosen as a strategic venue as this cotton producing centre is located close to Haryana and Rajasthan borders. Modi and his colleagues are trying to reap maximum political mileage from the MSP announced for Kharif crops recently that involves 150 per cent of the input cost of the farmers. Many more such rallies are expected in the days to come, particularly in poll-bound states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh where elections are scheduled before the Lok Sabha polls. Punjab and Haryana being the key agricultural states were the ideal location for Wednesday's rally. Besides the Akali leaders including former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, his deputy Sukhbir Badal and union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar also attended the event. As expected Modi went on to launch an attack on the Congress and its dynastic politics holding the party responsible for the woes of the farmers over the last 70 years. “The farmer is the aatma and ann daata of the country. The Congress has always betrayed the farmers. It has tried to make them a vote bank instead of working for their empowerment,” he charged while saying that the previous Congress governments implemented non scientific schemes. Hitting out at the Gandhi family, he said that development and prosperity of one family has always governed the Congress agenda. He also accused the Congress of misleading the farmers and its leaders now getting sleepless nights over the pro farmer initiatives being introduced by his government. “We are the ones who are working for Samman and Swabhiman of the farmers. We fulfilled our promise on One Rank One Pension for the defence personnel and we have fulfilled the promise on MSP,” he claimed. Referring to the recent MSP hike, he said that in certain cases the hike announced amounts to almost 200 per cent of the farmers' input costs. Modi claimed that even the small contract farmer would benefit from the initiative. Besides attacking the Congress leadership, he also took pot shots at the Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Referring to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) coming up at Bathinda that is the nerve centre of the cancer belt in Punjab, he asked the audience to tell Amarinder to expedite the work on the project. Congratulating Khattar for Haryana emerging as the top destination n north India for ease of doing business according to fresh rankings of Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) under the commerce and industry ministry, Modi asked the people to ask Amarinder government why Punjab is lagging behind. “The down slide has continued where Parkash Singh Badal left the state,” he said. He marketed various schemes launched by his government over the last four years including the Jan Dhan and the Ujjwala Yojana. The Congress too has taken to the ground trying to tell people that what Modi government is trying to sell as a revolutionary intervention is nothing more than a routine increase in the MSP of Kharif crops. Party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala had told media persons a couple of days ago that the party will compel Modi to answer in the Parliament once he is through with gathering headlines after 'hoodwinking the people'. Surjewala said, “They were the ones who had talked of the non-feasibility of giving 50 per cent over and above the input costs. Did they take the increased costs of diesel and fertilizers while calculating the MSP that has been announced ?” He pointed that what has been given is far less than what the calculations actually come down to. He challenged Modi to answer whether the current regime is not the first one to tax the farmers by imposing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on inputs? He also asked Modi why his government is shirking from the issue of loan waiver to small farmers. The Congress has also been attacking the Modi regime for the fleecing of farmers through Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana that has led to private insurance companies making money while the farmers have been left high and dry. Both the Akali-BJP combine in Punjab and BJP in Haryana aimed at boosting their political fortunes through Modi's rally. They were quick to announce the thanksgiving rally and burnt midnight oil to ensure a good gathering for the rally. However, many farmers' organisations have rejected the olive branch extended in the form of enhanced MSP by the Modi government. On the political level, just after the rally the Punjab Congress attacked the Akali leadership for backstabbing Punjab instead of raising their voice for demanding the just rights of the state. Soon after Modi's rally, both Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh of the Congress and Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira of the Aam Aadmi Party slammed the Badals for compromising Punjab's interests by sharing a stage with Khattar.",2018-07-11,," Modi in Malout: PM hard-sells MSP increase, Akalis face flak because of Khattar | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/modi-in-malout-pm-hard-sells-msp-increase-akalis-face-flak-because-of-khattar-122133.html
189,Akash Bisht,"A day after   (SP) leader Ram Gopal Yadav backed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government's push for 'one nation, one election', sharp divisions have emerged within the party over his stand. Sources informed that the line taken by Yadav is not the party's official stand, and a change may be on the cards once party chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister   returns from his trip abroad Tuesday. Senior party leaders are expected to meet Akhilesh and convey their reservation about the party endorsing simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and state legislatures. The SP President earlier dared the   (BJP) to implement simultaneous polls in 2019 after a electoral reforms committee, formed by the UP government, suggested that Assemblies whose term expires before 2021 can go to polls in 2019. Meanwhile, the committee further suugested that Assemblies whose term expire after 2021 can have elections in 2024. Responding to these suggestions, Akhilesh said: “We have no problems with ‘one nation one election’. I ask them to implement ‘one nation one election’ from 2019 itself and hold Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls with the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.” “Politically, it makes sense to dare the BJP government to hold Assembly elections in UP along with the upcoming General Elections in 2019. Akhilesh's reaction was confined to the committee's suggestions and also on Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) government's rising unpopularity in the state. However, to back the idea at a meeting convened by the Law Commission, cannot be party's official stand. Let Akhilesh return from his overseas trip which could see party change its position,” said a senior party leader. Another senior leader of the party claimed that no one in the party was aware that Ram Gopal would support the   government on this idea. “By supporting this idea, it seems we are also supporting the idea of holding next UP Assembly elections in 2024. I don't think this is what the party wants. We should wait for Akhilesh to return to make the party's official stand clear,” he said. The Law Commission invited recognised political parties to present their views on simultaneous elections held Saturday and Sunday. Having prepared a draft paper on 'Simultaneous Elections – Constitutional and Legal Perspectives', the Commission sought opinions of stakeholders, including political parties, constitutional experts, bureaucrats and members of the academia. Once satisfied, the Commission will prepare a report and send it to the government. Most parties opposed the idea claiming that it would subvert the Constitution by eroding India's federal structure and undermining regional aspirations. During the course of two days, Dravida Munnetra Khazagam, the Telugu Desam Party, the Bodoland People's Front, the SP, Telangana Rashtra Samithi,   (Secular), the Aam Aadmi Party, Shiromani Akali Dal, All-India Dravida Munnetra Khazagam, Biju Janata Dal, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Trinamool Congress, Goa Forward Party and Forward Block, appeared before the Commission. While most parties opposed the idea, the SP, SAD, BJD, TRS and the BPF favoured the idea. Except SP, these parties were expected to back the government. Therefore, SP's decision to support 'one nation, one poll' idea surprised all, considering how it has been batting for a united Opposition to take on the government over its policies and programmes. “The Samajwadi Party is in favour of simultaneous elections, but they should begin from 2019. In case public representatives switch sides or indulge in horse trading, action should be taken against them by the LG with a week,” Ram Gopal was quoted saying by ANI. The SP remains the only party from the united opposition camp to have endorsed the idea.  Meanwhile, the  , Rashtriya Janata Dal, Bahujan Samaj Party and the BJP have not stated their position on the issue as yet and have demanded for more time before making their intent clear. As far as SP is concerned, all eyes are on Akhilesh's return to see whether the party has a change of heart.",2018-07-09,, Ram Gopal extended support to simultaneous polls.

190,Charu Kartikeya,"  BJP’s push for holding simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state Assemblies continues to struggle to find backers. Most parties with whom the Law Commission has held consultations have refused to endorse the proposal and those who have backed it have come up with faulty explanations. While Telugu Desam Party, Trinamool Congress, the Left parties, All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM), All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), Goa Forward Party and   reportedly opposed the proposal, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( ) and Telangana Rashtra Samiti have supported it. SAD’s Naresh Gujral is believed to have said that the proposal will save government’s expenditure (https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-skip-law-panel-meet-on-simultaneous-lok-sabha-state-assembly-elections/story-nTUQsazVQZBh0osnqMfI8O.html), reduce expenditure of   and shorten the period of model code of conduct. As far as saving government’s expenditure is concerned, many have already argued that this is a superfluous argument. The Lok Sabha elections of 2014 cost Rs 3,426 crores, which is a paltry figure if one considers that the Union government’s last total bill for all kinds of expenses (2017-18) was for nearly Rs 27 lakh crores. It is important to hold elections organically, in alignment with developments specific to national and state politics. It is a necessary cost and the process must not be tampered and to save a few hundred crores of the taxpayer’s money can not be the motivation to tinker with this process. Gujral’s argument that the move will help parties in reducing their expenditures is faulty because there is nothing that is stopping parties from bringing down their costs to fight polls in the present scheme of things. It is the parties themselves who have inflated their own expenditures. No one has mandated parties to spend big on hiring chartered aircraft and holding 3D campaigns. The corruption behind the electoral process is another story altogether. If parties can themselves desist from these, their budgets will automatically come down. The Constitution of India and its processes do not need to be assaulted to bring down the bills of political parties. Another argument that has already been exposed as lacking any substance is that the period under model code of conduct will come down and governance will not suffer. That the model code hampers governance is a fallacy propagated by several political parties for their individual benefit. The code is designed to essentially prevent ruling parties from trying to divert public money to woo the voter at the time of elections. No provision of the code ties the hands of governments from carrying on with development works. Even in terms of activities that are prohibited, governments are free to approach the Election Commission to seek permissions on a case to case basis. If at all the parties that are backing the proposal for simultaneous polls want it to be implemented, they will have to come up with more honest arguments.  ",2018-07-09,, Parties backing ‘simultaneous polls’ proposal are coming up with dishonest arguments | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/parties-backing-simultaneous-polls-proposal-are-coming-up-with-dishonest-arguments-121780.html
191,Rajeev Khanna,"Over the last few days, rumour mongering leading to lynching of the minorities and the marginalised sections of the society has become a norm. But it has assumed a new dimension in Himachal Pradesh on the issue of presumed employment of some Rohingya refugees in door to door collection in Shimla. The outcome has been spewing of venom by the Hindutva groups and organisations across the region much to the delight of the political forces keen on polarisation of the society ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It all started with a report in a vernacular daily known for its right wing stance that pointed at employment of some Rohingya refugees for garbage collection by a construction company to which the garbage collection work has been outsourced for five wards of the town namely Totu, Machyat, Boileuganj, Kacchighati and Tuti Kandi. The report was rife with the ongoing right wing slander against the Rohingya Muslims pointing at their being a threat to the country. It posed a question how they could manage to reach Shimla. This got the tongues wagging and all sorts of rumours started doing the rounds with one of them saying that someone had seen United Nations identity cards on some people. This brought a much sought opportunity for organisations like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) that were quick to lap it up. The VHP immediately issued a statement saying: “Rohingya Muslims will not be accepted in the state at any cost. There are already hundreds of Bangladeshis living illegally in Himachal and arrival of Rohingyas will be a big security threat to the state. Their being brought to Shimla as employees points to a big conspiracy.” The VHP threatened to launch an agitation if the Rohingyas were not sent back and action was not taken against the company that recruited them. The organisation demanded that the recruitment be done at the local level. The most serious aspect of the issue has been that not even a single person has come forward to say that he or she had met any Rohingyas. Things came to a pass that Shimla Mayor Kusum Sadret had to issue a statement saying that no Rohingyas had been deployed for door to door garbage collection. “We have not signed the letter of intent and the contractor has not even started the work,” she said. She said the contractor has been asked to recruit people only after police verification. “There are many questions. Who saw the Rohingyas? Who started the rumours? Did the police do any verification? The biggest issue is that is it not the job of the police to come out clarifying things?” asked former Mayor Sanjay Chauhan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He has also accused the   (BJP)-led Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC) first allowing a mess to be created on garbage collection and then going in for outsourcing the garbage collection in the name of the same mess thus paving the way for privatisation of the entire garbage collection mechanism. But more important is the bogey that is being created against the minorities in the hill state. Chauhan has aimed a shot at the ruling pointing, “Isn't it strange that the recruitment is being done by the RSS-BJP people sitting in the SMC and then these very same people are making a hue and cry about it. What does one make of it? Is it the preparation for 2019 ?” The kind of venom being spewed against the minorities puts to shame the people of this hill state that takes pride in calling itself a 'cultured, educated and developed' society. Those spewing venom include people from professions like teaching. It comes as a shock to read social media posts like the one saying. “  (Kill the *********. When you go for the assault please call me. My number is **********).”  This is surely not something that can be expected from people of Himachal and particularly those from Shimla. Over the last few years a hate campaign has been on in various districts of the state, particularly against the Muslims, by the right wing groups. In towns like Solan it is through sheer dint of hard work that the Muslim migrants have prospered as masons, plumbers along with other professionals required in the construction industry and also as those running the fruit and vegetable business. Most of them are from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.  The right-wing organisations have been running a whispered campaign against them often provoking the unemployed locals against them saying that these migrants have usurped what is rightfully theirs. This campaign is backed by the general campaign being carried out by the across the country by the Hindutva organizations on issues like cow vigilantism etc. Although there is hardly any Muslim population in the state, the agenda appears to keep a fear of minorities alive in the majority to achieve political goals. Barring the Left that has a presence in small pockets, no other political force has come forward to condemn these attempts at communal polarisation. While this cannot be expected from the BJP, the Congress by trying to peddle soft Hindutva too is failing the people on this count. This has left the minorities, particularly the Muslims including a large number of Kashmiris who work as labourers in the state, standing extremely vulnerable to the communal diatribe and insecurity that accompanies this campaign. Such vicious campaigns are only expected to increase as the country heads towards the Lok Sabha polls.",2018-07-10,, Himachal's shame: Rumour mongering against Rohingyas to achieve communal polarisation | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/himachal-s-shame-rumour-mongering-against-rohingyas-to-achieve-communal-polarisation-121956.html
192,CK Manoj,"The idea was to establish an emotional connect with the people and to an extent he succeeded in his mission. “At least he had sattu with us instead of eating at a hotel, and had water from a handpump instead of a Bisleri bottle,” is the refrain among many locals. “Sattu is the poor man’s food. Farmers, rickshaw-pullers, labourers and vendors who toil hard from sunrise to sunset, survive on sattu as they can’t afford good food. Now, I have joined their daily routine,” says Tej Pratap who served as the health minister in the previous Grand Alliance government. Although rivals reject it as a publicity stunt, the RJD believes the campaign has the ingredients to work wonders. The idea is to expand the RJD's vote-bank beyond the existing Muslim-Yadav (M-Y) combination which has kept the party in firm position since it came into being in 1997 after splitting the parent  . The RJD believes the entire political scene will undergo a complete change if even 10% of rural poor voters other castes shift towards the party. The M-Y combine accounts for some 30 percent of the total electorate in Bihar and if the extra votes get added with the RJD, it will indeed give a tough fight to the BJP which is now working hard to retain power.  In the last 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP-led NDA had emerged victorious on 31 seats out of Bihar’s total 40 seats. The RJD and Congress won six seats together, but that was despite a strong Modi wave sweeping across the country whereas JD-U led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was able to win only two seats. The JD-U was not a part of the NDA then. RJD's Sattu Party also shows that the party's poll strategy is currently being chalked out by Lalu Prasad's children as the RJD president himself is seriously sick and is out on bail for treatment of multiple diseases. Prasad suffers from as many 15 diseases and the party is also not sure whether he will recover before the next LS polls. Even if he recovers, it is uncertain if he will be granted regular bail to campaign for his party. Prasad has been sentenced to jail in as many as three separate fodder scam cases, dealing a blow to his political career, leaving him transfer powers to the hands of his children. He has appointed his suave and matured younger son   as his main political heir. It will be really interesting to see how far the “Sattu party” being hosted by the RJD is able to challenge Modi’s “Chai pe charcha”.As the BJP continues its much-hyped “Sampark for Samarthan” (contact for support) campaign to contact some one lakh people who are recognised names in their respective fields to inform voters about the   government’s achievements ahead of the next year’s general elections, the main Opposition RJD in Bihar headed by jailed Lalu Prasad has come out with an interesting strategy to offset the plan. The RJD which was relegated to the Opposition after its ally, Chief Minister   suddenly switched sides and returned to the BJP camp last year has launched “Sattu Party” to woo common voters in huge numbers. The party believes sattu (fried gram flour) is the common man’s food and its initiative will attract poorer voters from all caste groups. Earlier this week, the party launched its campaign from Mahua, a key Assembly segment in Bihar’s Vaishali district, considered to be World’s First Republic and the birthplace of democracy by historians. The selection of this Assembly segment for launch of this campaign assumes significance as it is represented by  , elder son of the jailed RJD president. During the day-long campaign, Tej Pratap not only drove a rickshaw carrying the original rickshaw puller and took bath at a public place but also ate “sattu” in the company of common villagers at an open public place, drawing a huge applause from common villagers. Here are some glimpses from Tej Pratap's outreach.   ",2018-07-12,," RJD launches 'Sattu Party' outreach in Bihar, Tej Pratap impresses voters  | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/rjd-launches-sattu-party-outreach-in-bihar-tej-pratap-impresses-voters-122291.html
193,Akash Bisht,"After having spent close to four years in political oblivion, former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy rejoined the Congress and was welcomed back into the party by party president  . Also known for being united Andhra's last chief minister, Reddy had resigned as CM and Congress member over differences with the party high command on the issue of bifurcation of the state. After meeting the Congress president, Reddy was formally welcomed into the party by the party's General Secretary in-charge for Andhra Pradesh Oommen Chandy in presence of APCC President Raghuveera Reddy and party leader Pallam Raju. Speaking to the media, Chandy said that Reddy had expressed his desire to join the party which was welcomed by Congress president. Welcoming his return to the party, Chandy said, “His presence will definitely strengthen the Congress party”. “I am very happy that I am coming back to the Congress family. Although I resigned as chief minister, I cannot be separated from the Congress party because my father and me were MLAs for eight terms. Whatever identity me and my family have, is because of the Congress party. All this was possible because of the Congress. In the present situation, I strongly feel that the Congress party should be strengthened and Rahulji hands should be strengthened,"" Reddy said. He went on to add that unless the Congress forms the government at the Center, justice will not be done to the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Raising the issue of non-implementation of the Reorganisation Act including Special Status and Special Incentive, he claimed that the central and state governments have failed and only the Congress has the will to implement it. A four time legislator, Reddy has in the past occupied key posts including that of chief whip, Assembly speaker and chief minister. However, the UPA government's decision of bifurcating Andhra had Reddy fuming and he decided to sever all ties with the party. Thereafter, he floated Jai Samaikyandhra Party before the 2014 General Elections. However, JSP fared poorly with most of its candidates losing their deposits. In fact, JSP polled lesser votes than NOTA which further pushed Reddy into oblivion. Since the 2014 debacle, reports suggest that Reddy had shifted base to Bengaluru. Thereafter, there were reports of Reddy joining the BJP which never materialised. Apparently, BJP was wary of TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu considering he never shared a great rapport with Reddy. Once BJP made its intent clear to the former CM, Reddy was linked to Jana Sena. However, that too never happened because Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan announced that he did not want anyone from other political parties, particularly the Congress. Since then, there have been rumours of Reddy returning to the Congress which finally materialised on Friday. Hoping to stage a revival in the state where it has ceded the political space to TDP and YSRCP, Congress has been reaching out to politicians who left the party since 2014 and Reddy was one of them. Sources claimed that what further worked in Reddy's favour was Sonia's recalling the former chief minister's last words while discussing how to stage Congress' revival in the state. Reddy had in 2014 claimed that bifurcation would spell disaster for the party. His words turned prophetic and since then Congress has become politically irrelevant in the southern state. Sources further claimed that Rahul had been consulting Reddy over the Congress' revival and the latter seem to have told him to train all guns at YSRCP instead of TDP. Sources revealed that Reddy suggested that it is Jaganmohan Reddy's party that had primarily eaten into the Congress' vote share and an attack on him could help in restoring the Congress' lost glory. Bereft of a popular face in Andhra Pradesh, the Congress is hoping that Reddy's induction could help it stage a revival in the state. The Congress hopes that Reddy's status as the last chief minister of united Andhra and his stand against bifurcation could help in beefing up his image. However, political observers are of the opinion that the Congress won't gain much by Reddy's entry. ""Reddy's inclusion will not help the party in any manner. The Congress is psychologically down in the state and feels that their stalwarts joining the party will help it regroup and stage a comeback. However, Reddy doesn't have any sort of political hold in the state. In fact, he didn't even contest the 2014 general election out of fear of losing. As far as rebuilding a political party is concerned, one does not expect Reddy to help in any manner,"" said Dr K Benjamin, Professor and Head of the Political Science department at Osmania University. He went to add that the Congress' voter base has gone to Jaganmohan Reddy. He has been consistently interacting with people at the grassroots, giving him an edge over the Grand Old Party. ""Instead of reaching out to these stalwarts, the Congress should reach out to Jagan for some sort of political understanding. The Congress' problem with Jagan started after the Gandhi family refused to give him family privileges that they themselves enjoy. Ironically, they sidelined Jagan saying that they do not encourage dynastic politics which is a sham in itself. If Congress is hoping to make any sort of impact, it should reach out to Jagan. Or else, it will continue to get further marginalised in the state,"" Benjamin added.",2018-07-13,, Kiran Kumar Reddy returns to Congress.

194,Rajeev Khanna,"The crossing over of former three-time   (BJP) MLA Kanubhai Kalsaria to the Congress in Gujarat is a big image booster for the latter. While the BJP has been gloating about the recent successful poaching of Koli leader Kunvarji Bavaliya to its camp, Kalsaria joining the Congress is being seen as an equally important move in the political chess-board in the state. Kalsaria is a leader with a clean image and mass acceptance in the all-important Saurashtra region of the state that sends 58 of the 182 MLAs to the state assembly. His joining the grand old party will address the credibility crisis that it has been facing over the years. Kalsaria was inducted into the Congress by the party president   in New Delhi on Wednesday after a brief meeting that was also attended by the All India Congress Committee's Gujarat in-charge Rajeev Satav. Kalsaria was the BJP MLA from Mahuva seat near Bhavnagar for three terms from 1998 onwards. He had quit the saffron camp ahead of the 2012 assembly polls to form a Sadbhavna Manch and had unsuccessfully contested the polls as an independent. More recently, he also had a small stint with the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) that failed to take off in Gujarat. Kalsaria has been known more as a social activist than a politician. He will be remembered for spearheading a farmers' agitation from 2008 onwards against the Gujarat government under the then Chief Minister   for allegedly allocating large tracts of wetland to Nirma Industries for setting up a cement plant in his constituency. The matter is still caught in legal wrangles but his efforts at that time ensured that the cement factory initiative did not take off. He had carried out the agitation successfully while being a MLA of the ruling party and that too at a time when Modi was the chief minister and nobody dared to speak against him. In 2011, Kalsaria had led a 330 km farmers' march on the issue from Dholiya village in Mahuva to Gandhinagar. It was in Dholiya village that a government created reservoir to check salinity ingress was falling prey to the proposed cement plant. This was one of the largest people's march that has been witnessed by the country after independence. The question posed by the agitators was that what was the necessity to build a cement plant on a wetland. The result was that the then Congress led UPA government at the Centre had withdrawn the environment clearance given to the company. The agitation was a big embarrassment for Modi and the BJP. “He is an epitome of simplicity and has done so much for the society. He is a general surgeon who has set up two hospitals in Mahuva and Kalsar village in the coastal interiors that are being run by the Sadbhavna Trust. These hospitals are a model in public health care where surgeries that cost up to Rs 1 lakh in other private hospitals are being performed for a mere Rs 5,000 which is mainly the administrative cost. The poor who cannot pay at that time are told to pay the fee whenever they have the money later. People have been paying the money in later months and years. Since coastal Saurashtra is rife with the problem of kidney stones, his hospitals have earned the nomenclature of 'Pathrini Hospital' (Hospital of Stones). More than one lakh people have availed the health care benefits at these hospitals for a nominal sum,” said a political observer who has penned a book in Gujarati on Kalsaria's contribution to the society. “Kalsaria had contested the 1998 polls as a greenhorn against the former chief minister Chhabildas Mehta and had emerged as a giant-killer by defeating the latter. Though he won twice again from the Mahuva seat, he has remained people's servant than their ruler. He lives a life of 'voluntary poverty' wherein he has been taking a minimal remuneration from the hospital and has been residing in a small two room accommodation in the hospital compound in Wadli village. Despite coming from the OBC community of Ahirs, he never availed reservation benefits for any of his three daughters one of whom is a bright surgeon.” He disclosed that his contemporaries in the medical profession, most of whom are strong RSS and BJP workers prevented him from joining the Congress before. He also believes that Kalsaria's small stint with AAP was also a waste of his energies. Talking to Catch, Kalsaria said, “Having spent more than 15 years in the BJP I studied the party well from inside. Even while being their MLA I fought them on people's issues. I also tried AAP but it has no future in Gujarat. All the present political parties are more or less the same. In the BJP there is a lot of show but people are not able to express themselves while in the Congress there is democracy inside.” He said that while Modi has the gift of being a good orator who can publicise things and make a show of things, the fact is that the BJP is empty inside. “The voice of the villages is never heard in the urban areas. The image of all good is presented outside in the cities through media which is not true,” he added. Kalsaria said that good people should join Congress and build up a clean image of the party. “I am asked why I did not try to cleanse the BJP while remaining inside that party. I want to say that no one can attempt to cleanse it till the time Modi is there. When people like Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Keshubhai Patel were conveniently sidelined people like me never stood anywhere,” he added. Congress spokesperson in Gujarat, Manish Doshi said that Kalsaria's arrival in the party is a big boost to the party's image. “He is a man who is sensitive to the people and the issues concerning them. He is a man connected to the ground. The Congress will go a long distance with his arrival and if more people like him join the party fold,” he said. It remains to be seen how Congress utilises Kalsaria's positive image for making electoral inroads ahead of the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.",2018-07-12,, Activist and 3-time BJP MLA Kanu Kalsaria joins Congress.

195,Akash Bisht,"Showing signs of greater unity, the Opposition will bring a no-confidence motion against the NDA government over special status category to Andhra Pradesh. In the previously held Budget session, the differences within the Opposition led to three parties – Congress, TDP and YSRCP – giving separate notice for no-confidence motion. However, better sense seems to have prevailed over the opposition after Congress and 11 other parties have decided to support TDP's decision to move the motion. In fact, TDP MP Srinivas Kesineni gave notice to Lok Sabha General Secretary to include no-confidence motion in the council of ministers, in the list of business for Wednesday. In his letter, the MP wrote, “Under rule 198 (1) of Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha, I hereby give notice to move the following motion of No-Confidence in the Council of Ministers. Kindly include the same in the Revised List of Business for 18-07-2018 – This House expresses its want of confidence in the Council of Ministers.” Supporting TDP's decision, the Congress' leader of the opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the party will support the motion against the   government. “If the government does its job, it must face the motion of no-confidence. The rule says that if 54 MPs give a motion of no confidence then the chair has to admit it. There is no escape. We have witnessed in the past that even if 100 people stand in support, the motion is not accepted,” he said. The Monsoon Session beginning Wednesday will yet again see the Opposition sparring with the government over a host of issues including that of special status to Andhra Pradesh. Laying out the blueprint for the upcoming session, the Congress' Mallikarjun Kharge said that during the all party meet, a consensus was reached to raise issues that are important and in the public interest. He went on to add that during the all party meet it was decided that we will support the government to ensure a smooth functioning of the Parliament. Accusing the Prime Minister and his ministers for misleading the people over non-functioning of Parliament, Kharge said, “Whenever we raise important issues for discussion, they seek new ways to avoid it. That is why the discussion doesn't happen. Thereafter, the PM and BJP leaders blame the opposition for stalling Parliament.” Slamming the NDA for failing on all fronts, the Congress said that the Opposition would seek a debate with the government on the BJP's manifesto that it came out with in 2014. Congress claimed that the Opposition will also seek a debate on the increasing incidents of lynchings on the pretext of cow protection. The party went on to add that lynching cases have seen a spurt ever since BJP came to power in 2014. In fact, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Parliament to bring a special law to establishing lynching as separate offence with a harsh punishment. Kharge went on to add that a united opposition will raise other issues including rising unemployment; safety of women; misrule in J&K; restoration the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act; attempts by the government to end reservation in autonomous institutions; farmers' issues; price rise; foreign policy failures; black money; among others. Kharge added that the opposition will also try to seek answers from the government on the Ahmedabad District Cooperation Bank. According to him, Rs 750 crore were deposited in the bank five days before demonetisation was announced by the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, Azad said that the Congress will also raise the issue of alleged EVM tampering in Assembly polls and demand going back to the ballot paper system for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Both the leaders exhorted that if the no confidence motion is taken, it will lead to all these issues being discussed threadbare by the opposition. Adding to this, Azad mentioned that the Opposition has collectively identified these issues. In another development, the suspense over the members of the Congress Working Committee was finally over after the party announced names of individuals who are part of the newly constituted CWC. The party has nominated 18 CWC members along with 18 permanent invitees and 10 special invitees.",2018-07-17,," Monsoon Session: Opposition unites, likely to bring No Confidence Motion against Modi | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/monsoon-session-opposition-unites-likely-to-bring-no-confidence-motion-against-modi-123150.html
196,Rajeev Khanna,"Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh, who represents Gurugram in Lok Sabha, made headlines recently when he targetted Haryana Chief Minister Manohal Lal Khattar over caste-based discriminations. It was not the first time – In May, he gave a piece of his mind when Khattar failed to reach an event to mark four years of the   government. These instances have exposed cracks in the ruling   (BJP) in a state where Assembly elections will be due soon after next year's Lok Sabha polls. They can be embarassing for the party. All the same, there are political observers who feel otherwise: Such contrarian stands resemble the time-tested strategy of the   (RSS) of speaking in different voices to gauge the public mood and settle down at a point of convenience. Whatever be the case, Inderjit's reported outburst at a workers' meet left the Khattar regime red-faced. “... The state has seen cracks along castes in his (Khattar's) regime. No one can rule in this situation as it has taken the shape of a three-legged chair, on which no one can sit,” he said. A 'leader' should be appointed chief minister, instead of a CM learning to be a leader, Inderjit said, taking a jibe at Khatta without naming him. He also hit out at Khattar regrding the non-completion of the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal despite the Supreme Court ruling in favour of Haryana. The Indian National Lok Dal has been playing the issue up: “Once, the CM discussed the SYL issue with me and planned to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with other Haryana leaders to seek the delegation of a central agency for ensuring the execution of the Supreme Court verdict. “I do not know whether he has met the Prime Minister or not,” he reportedly said, adding that he, along with other Parliamentarians from the state would call on Modi in the forthcoming monsoon session of the Lok Sabha to demand execution of the project. Inderjit refuted speculation over his departure from the BJP. But his attack on Khattar points to a simmering caste cauldron in Haryana. The manner in which the Khattar government dealt with the 2016 Jat agitation over reservation of seats in educational institutions and jobs deepened caste-divide. Jats stood isolated from the remaining 35 biradaris (communities) and the BJP was accused by the opposition of polarising the society for political benefits, a political analyst said. The Khattar regime was held responsible for paralysing the state administration on the ground at the peak of the violence and not reining in Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini from spewing venom against community. Some observers think Inderjit's outburst can be a ploy to consolidate his position in the state's Yadav-dominated Ahirwal region. “By praising Modi and attacking Khattar from the same platform, he has got nothing to loose,” pointed out a senior political observer Balwant Takshak. Inderjit, they said, was looking at at least one more term in the Lok Sabha MP and wants his daughter to enter the state Assembly. Such muscle flexing can help him achieve both goals.  Others think his outburst was part of the Sangh Parivar strategy of speaking in different voices. “The BJP has taken no action until date against Saini for his continuing venomous diatribe against the Jats. Inderjit talking against Khattar from a different platform is an additional voice coming from a different corner of the state. It can be a part of the strategy to get electoral returns by taking different stands and later come back together to join hands,” Takshak said. Whatever the case, by his repeated outbursts Inderjit has emerged as a leader to keep a watch on.",2018-07-17,, Is Rao Inderjit's outburst against Khattar genuine discontent or BJP's electoral ploy | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/is-rao-inderjit-s-outburst-against-khattar-genuine-discontent-or-bjp-s-electoral-ploy-123133.html
197,Rajeev Khanna,"Dr Dharamvir Gandhi's tenure as a member of Parliament may be in limmbo, but the Aam Aadmi Party leader continues to be relevant due to stands he take on social issues in Punjab. Gandhi, who represents Patiala in Lok Sabha, again raised ripples by asking External Affairs Minister   to talk to her Pakistani counterpart on allowing Partition victims visit their birthplaces.  “The people of Punjab on both sides of the border suffered huge loss in terms of human lives during the partition of 1947 … and are still suffering from simmering wounds of partition and memories attached with it. “This is more true in case of the older generation on both sides of the border and thousands, if not lakhs in their late 70s or 80s have a strong yearning to visit their native birth places on both sides of the border,” Gandhi wrote to Swaraj. Such a move could be one of the best confidence-building measures among India and Pakistan and improve bilateral relations, Gandhi told Catch News. Whenever Indians visit Pakistani Punjab, particularly Nankana Sahib, people on the other side gather to see if someone from their native village in India or a neighbouring village is a part of the visiting contingent, he said.  Even otherwise, relations between the people in both Punjabs have been cordial and warm. At every opportunity to host each other, they have made sure their guests return with warm memories, he pointed out.  This is only one of such issues taken up by Gandhi that strikes a chord with the people. Even on Punjab's burning problem of drugs, he has suggested radical solutionslike legalising and regulating the supply of traditional intoxicants such as opium and marijuana (cannabis).  He also sought an amendment to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, suggesting that non-synthetic drugs can be used to wean away addicts from the fatal synthetic drugs. He has urged the state government to allow plantation of marijuana and poppy husk in kitchen gardens on a trial basis on the lines of United States, Canada, Netherlands and Brazil. Gandhi has also been vociferous in seeking rights for Dalits, both inside and outside Parliament, holding the Brahminical order and capitalism responsible for their plight. He has been persistently attacking the principles laid in 'Manusmriti' while underlining that higher education for Dalits is the only way to their empowerment. In Punjab he has been running a campaign against establishment of separate cremation grounds for the Dalits. “In my constituency I have been able to convince more than 150 panchayats to do away with the practice of having separate cremation grounds for the Dalits,” he said. Gandhi has also been one of those rare politicians who have been speaking out against the Deras in Punjab whose heads have been exploiting the poor people by usurping their land and through other means. “It is my duty to speak for the people who are being suppressed by the Dera mafia. Why only Ram Rahim should be behind bars while others continue to cheat and exploit people,” he said. No politician in Punjab dares to utter a single word against the Deras being run by god men in the state for the simple reason of losing out on a vote bank. Gandhi has also been fighting for affordable health care to the masses. He has been seeking regulation of the private healthcare industry including the diagnostic laboratories. He has taken up these issues along with the need to bring medical devices under price control with Prime Minister  .  This is a considerable achievement for an MP who remains suspended by his parent party. Gandhi has refused to quit as an MP saying that he was elected by the people an no one else and he must take up their aspirations in his capacity as their elected representative. He is all set to part ways with   before the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls. He has floated a Punjab Manch hat is expected to evolve into a political party in due course in time. At present AAP in Punjab continue to be in turmoil and there are voices being raised to bring back Gandhi into the party fold along with another suspended MP Harinder Singh Khalsa. It remains to be seen how things unfold as polls approach but Gandhi has surely made a mark in his solo stint.",2018-07-18,, Why this suspended AAP MP continues to make waves | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-this-suspended-aap-mp-continues-to-make-waves-123321.html
198,Sulagna Sengupta,"While addressing a Krishak Sabha (farmers' rally) in West Midnapore on Monday, Prime Minister   said that the situation in West Bengal is worse than what is was during the Left regime. “In the state, everything is controlled through Trinamool Congress run syndicates. If you want to construct a school or college, you will have to purchase stone, bricks and sand from shops run by Trinamool functionaries. This chit fund business is also run by Trinmool syndicates,” Modi alleged, further adding “Everything is decided by Trinamool Congress cadres and they are encouraged by a government run in the name of Ma Mati Manush”. “Even Dalits are being tortured in Bengal and the Trinamool Congress unleashed unbridled terror during the Panchayat election,” he further said. Modi urged the people to “gather the courage and fight the syndicates”. Responding to Modi's comments, West Bengal Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee said, “BJP is a party that runs a syndicate that peddles religious extremism. The party is a syndicate for fanatics and for corruption. Modi’s speech showed that BJP does not have any development agenda”. According to Modi, the new support prices for rain-fed kharif crops will be 50% above the cost of production. The Centre has also approved higher fair and remunerative prices (FRP) for sugarcane and jute farmers. Taking a jibe at the posters of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee along either side of the road near the venue of his rally, Modi said “I am grateful to Mamata Banerjee for greeting me with folded hand in the posters at Midnapore and it has been done by chief minister to congratulate me for the work I have done for farmers.” Responding to this, Chatterjee said that the posters were put up for Trinamool Congress's “martyr's day rally on 21 July and BJP workers had in fact defaced many of these posters”. Meanwhile during Modi's speech, a portion of the pandal that was erected for the rally gave way, injuring at least 44 people. Seven are said to be critical. Some of them were admitted to the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital and Modi visited them after the rally. Modi said, “I am overwhelmed to see the crowd in West Midnapore, despite an accident. I have never seen such a disciplined crowd in Gujarat too. Despite an accident, people remained disciplined and sat to hear my speech. I will remember this forever.” Mamata Banerjee tweeted after the rally, “We pray for the speedy recovery of all those injured at the Midnapore rally. The government is providing all help for medical treatment.” The Trinamool Congress mentioned that BJP has to take the responsibility for the accident victims. Trinamool Congress also countered the BJP's claims on farmers. “The BJP has promised to double farmers' income in their manifesto. But they haven't delivered. In Bengal, farmers' income has gone up 2.25 times in seven years. In 2011, it was Rs 91,000 and last year it went up to Rs 2,90,000,” Chatterjee said. He further cited how hundreds of farmers in BJP-ruled states were committing suicide, whereas in Bengal there were no such instances.  Meanwhile a scuffle broke out at Mohanpur near Khragpur in West Midnapore between BJP supporters and the police, after the former claimed that the cops did not let them enter Modi's rally. Sources in the district administration said that around 14 police officers were injured in attacks by BJP workers and they have been admitted to nearby hospitals.",2018-07-16,, Modi's rally in Midnapore sparks BJP vs Trinamool war of words | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/modi-s-rally-in-midnapore-sparks-bjp-vs-trinamool-war-of-words-122963.html
199,Charu Kartikeya,"With its neglect in the last four years as a running theme, Parliament is all set to convene once again with a heavy legislative agenda. The Monsoon Session of Parliament will start Wednesday (18 July) and will carry on until 10 August, with a total of 18 sittings. An all-party meeting chaired, strangely, by Prime Minister   was held Tuesday morning where all parties reportedly aired the respective concerns that they would like to raise during the session. After the meeting, the PM and his team tried to create an impression that this session could witness greater understanding and co-operation between the treasury as well as Opposition benches. However, that seems unlikely as the political relationship between the two sides is as hostile right now as it was during the Budget Session. Indeed, at least one of the opposition leaders minced no words in saying that Parliament will not function if their demands are not met. ’s Ramgopal Yadav asserted unequivocally that the Opposition will not allow the House to function till an assurance was given by the government on reservation to SCs and STs in higher education.” This exchange will continue at the all-party meeting called by Speaker   later today, but it is unlikely that a compromise formula will emerge.

200,Rajeev Khanna,"Uttarakhand's only regional force –-Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) has just concluded a public outreach campaign under its 'Gaon Basao Rajya Bachao' programme. The party may or may not benefit electorally from this drive as it stands on the margins of the state polity at present but this programme has been successful in underlining the political crisis in Uttarakhand in context of the continuing emigration and people abandoning their homelands. Village after village continues to be abandoned by its residents in search of employment and livelihood. There are several villages here one can only come across the elderly. There has been a collective failure of the respective governments that have come to power in this hill state since its inception to curb this phenomenon. There are serious security implications too of this continuing trend as the villages along the border see massive emigration. The UKD carried out its programme in all the 13 districts of its three main geographical regions of the Terai, Garhwal and Kumaon through a Rath Yatra.. Party leader Trivendra Panwar pointed that the inability of the people to get proper education, health and other basic facilities like transport along with poor road connectivity is responsible for the people abandoning their villages. Another major reason is the large scale unemployment. Uttarakhand is one of those states in the country where a major chunk of the population continues to survive on money order economy run on the contributions of the youth enrolling in defence and para military services. Demonetisation and shoddy implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) by the   led government at the centre has further added to the unemployment in the state. “More than 3000 schools have shut down in the last 18 years since the state came into existence and the condition in government hospitals is such that there neither do they have doctors nor the medicines,” Panwar said. Party spokesperson Sunil Dhyani said, “We are organizing a two day meet at Gairsain on July 24 and 25 to discuss our findings during the drive. We have got a positive response from the people and we will chalk out our future course of action after this meet.” UKD's programme needs to be seen in the light of the interim report of the Rural Development and Migration Commission that was released a couple of months back by the Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat that itself paints a worrisome picture of the state. The vice president of the Commission SS.Negi said that a survey of 7950 gram panchayats was conducted in January and February 2018 wherein the commission team members toured all the districts of the state and consulted the people and talked about various aspects of rural development and migration. The survey said that the main occupation of the people at gram panchayat level is agriculture and labour with their figure standing at 43 per cent and 33 per cent respectively. The report pointed that in the last 10 years, 3,83,726 people from 6338 gram panchayats have migrated temporarily. They visit their home but live outside the state for employment. During the same period, a total of 1,18,981 people of 3946 gram panchayats have migrated permanently. The report further says that 50 per cent people of gram panchayats have migrated due to problem of livelihood and employment, while 15 per cent for education and eight per cent for lack of medical services. Also, 42 per cent youth in the age group of 26 to 35 have migrated from gram panchayats, whereas the figure for age group above 35 years and below 25 years stands at 29 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively. Negi disclosed that 70 per cent people from the villages migrated to various places within the state, while 29 per cent went outside Uttarakhand and around one per cent have gone abroad. The report says that after 2011 census, 734 revenue villages or hamlets of the state have no population. Out of these, 14 are located within five kilometres of aerial distance from international border. There are 565 revenue villages or hamlets that witnessed 50 per cent decrease in population after 2011. Out of them, six are located within five kilometres of aerial distance from international border. While releasing the report Trivendra Rawat said that providing new opportunities of employment in villages, quality education and best health facilities, is the main target of his government. Through all this, migration can be stopped in an effective manner. He went on to list the initiatives that his government has taken. He claimed that NCERT syllabus has been introduced in the schools and emphasis is on recruiting more doctors. He also underlined how tele medicine is helping improve the health facilities and intensive care units are being established in hospitals in far flung areas. But such claims have been made by his predecessors too. It is time all the political forces in the state start thinking seriously on how to mitigate this problem of large scale emigration. Many observers are of the opinion that what is required in central intervention in the form of a separate policy for the Himalayan states which is implemented with sincerity. Till that is done the number of ghost villages in Uttarakhand at least are set to increase bringing more concern and embarrassment to the government.",2018-07-21,, UKD's campaign to save village habitat exposes how Uttarakhand has gone wrong | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/ukd-s-campaign-to-save-village-habitat-exposes-how-uttarakhand-has-gone-wrong-123826.html
201,Sulagna Sengupta,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee launched her campaign for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with a massive Martyrs' Day rally in Kolkata's on Saturday. Addressing the rally Banerjee said “I am inviting all anti-BJP parties to come together and work out a formula on how to defeat the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections”. She said that a large anti-BJP rally will be held at the Brigade Parade ground on 19 January, 2019, in which several Opposition leaders would be invited. Sources said this would also include former Congress president  . She also claimed that the All India Trinamool Congress will win all the 42 Lok Sabha seats from West Bengal. On the other hand, the West Bengal BJP has decided to organise a counter rally on 23 January next year at the same venue, where Prime Minister   will address the people of Bengal. Rahul Sinha , BJP national secretary, said “We are not afraid of the Trinamool Congress rally. We will organise a counter rally on 23 January”. Banerjee even mocked at Modi’s speech in Parliament in which the Prime Minister said that he will remain in power till 2024. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is dreaming of staying in power till 2024. BJP somehow managed to get 325 seats in Parliament (during the No Confidence Motion) but they are outnumbered outside Parliament. At most, BJP will win 150 seats. You can trust my calculations. Had   been alive,   would never have voted for NDA and they will have to pay the price for their folly in the 2019 elections. In Tamil Nadu, Stalin will get 39 seats”. “Although   has an alliance with BJP, they abstained from voting during the No Confidence Motion. In Uttar Pradesh, if   and   fight together, BJP will not even get half of the 73 seats that it got last time. It will win 25 at most. In Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat too they will cut a sorry figure,” she added. Banerjee also said that the Trinamool Congress plans to hold a series of events in the near future such as a rally on 28 July at the same venue where Modi recently held a public meeting and the tent collapsed, as well as a “BJP Bhagao” campaign from 1 to 15 August. “They cannot even put up a tent properly. How can they run the country?” Banerjee quipped. Banerjee also pulled off an important coup over the BJP on Saturday by inducting Pioneer editor and former BJP Rajya Sabha MP Chandan Mitra into the party. Mitra had resigned from the BJP earlier this week. His move to the AITC is significant as he is one of the earliest journalists to join toe saffron party, that too at a time when it was considered a political pariah by many. Along with Mitra, five Congress MLAs from the party bastions of Malda and Murshidabad also joined the AITC as did rebel CPI(M) MP Ritabrata Banerjee and former CPI(M) MP Moinul Hasan. The Congress MLAs who joined AITC on Saturday include Akrujjaman, Sabina Yasmin, Abu Taher, Samar Mukherjee and Apurva Sarkar. Attacking the AITC, West Bengal Pradesh Congress chief Adhir Chowdhury said “ Trinamool Congress is threatening our leaders to join their party saying that they will be killed if they don't join. Banerjee is trying to establish autocracy in Bengal. She is responsible for the increase of the BJP’s vote share in Bengal.” During her speech on Saturday, Mamata Banerjee accused the BJP of creating hatred in society. “They (BJP) are saffronising all institutions and trying to divide society. All RSS and BJP leaders are not bad. Some old leaders who followed a spartan way of life were good.” Banerjee also said that the incidents of mob-lynching were been engineered by BJP leaders, who wanted to create instability in the country. “On Friday Prime Minister Narendra Modi instructed the state governments to take action against those who are involved in lynching. But their own party men are involved in lynching. I ask the Prime Minister, 'Has the BJP taken any steps to punish their own men involved in lynching?'” Banerjee said. She didn't spare the Congress either. “Congress leaders should think whether they want to align with the AITC at the national level to oust the BJP. I don’t need an alliance with the Congress in Bengal. We are capable of fighting alone. In Bengal, the CPI(M), Congress and BJP have teamed up to fight the Trinamool Congress. But still the Congress wants the AITC's help at the Centre.

202,Akash Bisht,"After being approached by the government to discuss the appointment of the Lokpal, senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has for the third time decided to boycott the selection committee meeting citing the “special invitee” tag. In his letter dated 18 July, Kharge wrote to Prime Minister   claiming that he won't be able to attend the meeting until the leader of the single largest Opposition party is conferred the status of a full-fledged member as envisioned in the Lokpal Act, 2013. The selection committee for selecting the ombudsman comprises the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India, the Lok Sabha Speaker, the leader of the largest Opposition party, and an eminent jurist. However, in the past, the government, in its response to the Supreme Court, had cited the lack of opposition leader as the reason for delay in anti-corruption ombudsman’s appointment. The veteran leader had earlier boycotted two meetings – 1 March and 10 April – citing similar reasons for his absence. The twin meetings were convened to decide on the appointment of an eminent jurist who would be a part of the selection committee. Back then Kharge, in his letters to the Prime Minister, had claimed that his attendance as special invitee does not entitle him to participate, voice his opinion and even vote during the course of the meeting. In his recent letter, Kharge made similar claims and went on to add how the invitation is only to mislead the nation and the people rather then sincerely seeking the participation and opinion of the Opposition. The veteran Congress leader in his letter to the Prime Minister said, “The government insists on continuing to invite me as special invitee to the Selection Committee despite being aware of the fact that there is no such provision under Section 4 of Lokpal Act. It has been four years since your government came to power and if the government was indeed sincere about including the voice of the opposition in this process, it would have brought the necessary amendments to ensure the same.” He goes on to add, “I am sure you are aware that the Select Committee has approved the Amendment to the Lokpal Act to include the Leader of the Single Largest Opposition Party as a member of the Selection Committee. The fact that this amendment has never been brought before the house by the government clearly indicates that the government is keen to keep the opposition outside the process of appointing the Lokpal.” Despite the Act being passed in 2013,the government had not yet shown any sincerity in appointing a Lokpal leading to Supreme Court reprimanding it for the same. Under serious pressure from the Supreme Court over the delay in Lokpal's appointment, the government intensified its efforts and reached out to Kharge to ensure his presence in the meeting. However, Kharge accused the government of deliberately delaying the appointment process while diluting the RTI Act and Whistleblower’s Protection Act. These actions according to him are further weakening laws to fight corruption and empowering common man. “Since no amendments in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 have been carried out, an invitation as a Special Invitee without rights of participation, recording of opinion and voting in procedure, is only to mislead the nation and the people, rather than sincerely seeking the participation and opinion of the Opposition,” Kharge said. He went on to add that till the time the leader of single largest Opposition party is conferred the status of a full-fledged member as envisioned in the Lok Pal Act, 2013. Meanwhile, earlier in February, the apex court had pointed that a Lokpal can be appointed in absence of a Leader of the Opposition. The court had said that the vacancy in selection committee should not be the reason for the delay in the appointment of the ombudsman. According to the law, Leader of the Opposition should be a member of the selection committee and though Congress is the largest party in the Lok Sabha, it doesn't have enough members to claim the post. At present, Congress has 48 legislators as opposed to 55 needed to claim the post. Though, the court has given a go-ahead to appoint Lokpal without the Leader of the Opposition, the central government under pressure decided to bring an amendment to change the rule. However, the amendment to the definition of Leader of Opposition in the Lokpal Act is still pending with the Parliament and the government's delay in getting it passed has created this friction between Congress and the former. Meanwhile, earlier on Tuesday, the Supreme Court, while hearing a petition filed by NGO Common Cause against the delay in the appointment of the ombudsman, directed the Center to shortlist names for appointment as Lokpal. The bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi, R Banumathi and Navin Sinha will resume hearing on 24 July after the government files a report on 23 July. The government has to file a reply after the selection committee holds its meeting on 19 July.",2018-07-19,," Kharge refuses to attend Lokpal meet as 'Special Invitee', says he has no rights | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/kharge-refuses-to-attend-lokpal-meet-as-special-invitee-says-he-has-no-rights-123522.html
203,Charu Kartikeya,"  The   government’s victory in the trust vote in Lok Sabha was not the day’s surprise. The curveball was actually Congress President  ’s speech and its theatrical culmination which has grabbed everybody’s eyeballs and imagination. While Modi’s reply to the debate did not carry any departure from his previous speeches, Gandhi’s address had spunk in more copious volume than ever before. The Amethi MP didn’t refer to any notes, was both sharp and emphatic and stood his ground resolutely even in the face of continuous attempts by ministers and BJP MPs to bully him. In fact, he took Modi head on and baited him into a duel, saying the latter refuses to look him in the eye and is fearful. He also directly attacked BJP President   as well as his son, for good measure, and used their reference to buttress his allegation of BJP’s crony-capitalism. Rahul Gandhi deployed a triad of boldness, confidence and skill to slay his political adversary, like never before. Modi, on the other hand, was predictable, at best and, at worst, rattled. The smugness on his face vanished during the moments Gandhi mentioned him directly, and the hug, which will be remembered for a long time to come, totally stumped him. Gandhi walked across the aisle after finishing his speech, reached over to Modi’s seat, gestured him to rise and upon receiving refusal, just went ahead and gave a seated Modi a full-fledged embrace. Modi was left stupefied and looking much more uncomfortable than many unsuspecting foreign leaders who have been caught unawares by his own habit of giving awkward hugs. Stunned, he gestured a retreating Gandhi to come back, whispered something into his ear, shared an uneasy laughter with him and patted him on his back even as the latter left for his own seat. This was a rare moment in the public life of the prime minister. A meticulous planner and a gifted performer, Modi has seldom been seen in a vulnerable position inside the country, certainly never in the Parliament. To be bettered by his principal adversary at a juncture when the country is hurtling towards the polls has a special significance for both sides. Observers were expecting a bombastic come back later in the day, when it was to be Modi’s turn to take the floor. However, he failed to roll up any new tricks up his sleeve and his imminent defeat in the day’s one-on-one kept getting increasingly evident as the evening progressed. Quite unlike his usual self, Modi was caught regularly consulting notes and getting distracted by TDP MPs’ relentless sloganeering. The trademark witty comebacks were also missing. Refusing to answer most points of criticism directly, he didn’t say a word on the unfulfilled promise of Rs 15 lakh in every bank account, the continuous assault on Dalits, tribals, minorities and women, the perils brought by demonetisation and failures of his foreign policy. He mentioned, instead, the shutdown of 2.5 lakh shell companies, rise in digital transactions and fall in prices of LED bulbs, apart from serving his usual fare of electricity connections, jan dhan accounts, Swachh Bharat toilets, MUDRA loans, LPG cylinders etc. Modi did appear to be in his elements for a while, when he told the Congress that the BJP created three new states in one go – Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand - and everything happened smoothly. The Congress created only one – Telangana – and look how contentious the situation continues to be, Modi jabbed. He also tried to expose TDP by saying that their leader and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu had agreed to a special package for the state in place of special status and made a U-turn later to hide his own failure in governance. However, Modi failed to come up with any explanation for his own U-turn over the special status promise. He slipped while defending his foreign policy too. Gandhi had alleged that the government messed-up the Doklam stand-off with China and also surrendered to Chinese agenda. Modi’s reply was that even as the government was trying to settle things at Doklam, Gandhi clandestinely met the Chinese ambassador. Neither did he address the allegations of buying Rafael jets at higher rates than those clinched under the UPA. Predictably, he played the patriotism card, emotionally slamming Gandhi for questioning the surgical strikes and consequently, the country’s soldiers. He also tried to drive a wedge in the opposition ranks, by saying Congress had a history of betraying a series of non-Congress leaders it initially promised to support – from Charan Singh to Chandrashekhar to Deve Gowda and IK Gujral. The biggest evidence of Modi’s failure, however, was in the manner he chose to address the criticism over his government’s failure to generate jobs. Faced against Gandhi’s statement that this was borne out by the government’s own data, Modi went on to do the unthinkable. He unleashed a barrage of assumptions from other sectors and correlated them to claim a much higher number of jobs generated than shown by the labour bureau’s statistics. Believe it or not, these included adding up the figures of probable car, truck and auto drivers and helpers base on car/truck/auto sales. If there was any more evidence required to prove Modi’s failure, it was this whataboutery. His government did succeed in winning the trust vote with a thumping margin, but the exercise didn’t really turn out to be an opportunity for the government to launch its campaign. It actually strengthened the Opposition by exposing the government’s failures and hollow promises, by displaying unity among opposition parties and by presenting Rahul Gandhi in an entirely new avatar.

204,Charu Kartikeya,"On 3 June, around 9000 applicants appeared for the examination for 160 posts at centres across the country. On 5 June, the Association wrote in letters to the Director as well as Nadda that at least 89 questions of the said exam were leaked. A copy of the leaked document was also attached with the letter.   The Association alleged that some candidates might have been favoured for selection and the leaked questions might have been provided to them. The letter appealed to the minister to cancel the 3 June exam and appoint a new Registrar at the institute.   The Director did act upon that letter but set up an internal inquiry committee to look into the allegations. The Association once again wrote to the Director on 7 July slamming the committee, saying that since the members of the committee were all from the institute’s administration, they can not be expected to conduct an impartial probe. Additionally, the committee lacked any representatives from police or CBI, technical expert and even a legal expert, the Association noted. It also alleged that digital video recorder of surveillance cameras in the room of the chief of examinations were suscpiciously removed.     Frustrated, the association wrote directly to the PM on 16 July, stating categorically that NIMHANS administration was trying to cover up the entire case. According to the association, the question paper was set by a retired employee and conducted by a private company, Sify Technologies Pvt Ltd. Interestingly, Sify grabbed the headlines in May when the CBI registered an FIR against 10 of its employees, in connection with another question paper leak. This leak pertained to the Combined Graduate Level Exam 2017 Tier II  by the Staff Selection Commission.     Sify had conducted this examination too and the CBI believes these employees of the company, in cahoots with government officials, were running a racket of leaking papers of examinations that various government departments had outsourced to the company. In its letter to the PM, the NIMHANS staff association also referred to the SSC CGL case and Sify’s allegedly dubious role in it. It has expressed apprehensions about a Rajasthan connection, stating that a large number of candidates selected after this examination appear to hail from Rajasthan, which is where the SSC CGL scam also allegedly originated. The association appealed to the PM to bring the matter to the notice of the CVC and CAG and order a CBI probe. Neither the health minister nor the prime minister have responded to the association’s letters, even as NIMHANS has rubbished the allegations. In fact, the institute has even gone ahead and published the results of the examination and conducted skill test/counselling of the shortlisted candidates on 23 July. This indicates that NIMHANS is in no mood to pay any heed to the association’s complaint and the PM’s silence is encouraging the institute.In a case of alleged irregularities in appointment at one of the country’s premier health institutes, reports have surfaced that questions of the examination for hiring of staff nurses at National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) were leaked on WhatsApp. What is more shocking is that from the institute’s administration to the highest offices in the country are in the know of the case but appear to be have turned a blind eye. The examination was conducted on 3 June and ever since, the NIMHANS Employees Association, a registered body, has red-flagged the leak through letters sent to the institute’s Director, Union Health Minister JP Nadda and right up to Prime Minister  . However, the institute has rubbished the allegations while the Prime Minister and the Health Minister have conveniently ignored the letters.  ",2018-07-24,, PM Modi sitting on complaint of appointment scam at NIMHANS | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/pm-modi-sitting-on-complaint-of-appointment-scam-at-nimhans-124360.html
205,Akash Bisht,"“Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid of the truth,” a combative   told the rattled treasury benches after they created ruckus over his allegations on Prime Minister   leading to adjournment of the Lok Sabha debating the no-confidence motion against the NDA government. Having earlier dared the prime minister for a 15-minute debate in the Parliament, which Rahul claimed the former would not be able to withstand, the Congress President did manage to make Modi and BJP jittery with his scathing attack over their policies. However, what took everyone by surprise was Rahul walking down the treasury benches to embrace the PM after his speech, which is easily the defining moment of the day. Not having found an opportunity to take on Modi over his policies and decisions in previous Parliament sessions, Rahul launched one of the sharpest attacks on the prime minister, cheered by Congress MPs who thumped their desks in joy. It been a while since a Congress leader spoke with such aggression while taking on Modi and BJP. Rahul began with a reference to a 21st century political weapon which he called a jumla strike. He first began with Modi's 2014 poll promise of depositing Rs 15 lakh in everyone's accounts which he called jumla no. 1. Yet again raising the report of exponential rise in the income of a firm owned by BJP President  's son, Rahul said, “The prime minister had said that I am nation's chowkidar and will protect it. However, when the son of a friend of the prime minister registers 16,000 times growth, the prime minister did not say a word.” Thereafter, the Congress president accused the prime minister of colluding with top industrialists and working for them while ignoring the farmers and the poor of the nation. “Prime Minister's photo appears in Jio's advertisement which suggests that he helps these forces,” he added. Rahul went on to attack the prime minister over the secrecy maintained by the Union defence minister over the details of the Rafale deal. Accusing the defence minister of speaking untruth over the price of Rafale jets, the 48-year-old leader claimed that the French president during a meeting informed him that there was no such secrecy clause. “He told me that there is no such clause and I should tell it to the entire nation.” He then claimed that the defence minister under pressure from the prime minister had lied to the nation. “The prime minister and defence minister should clarify to the nation over who they are supporting?” he asked. His allegations led to the defence minister protesting to Lok Sabha speaker   who promised to give her time after Rahul's speech. Further taking digs at the prime minister's “close relationship” with big business houses, the Congress president said how one such businessman benefited to the tune of Rs 45,000 crore in Rafale deal after the contract was taken away from HAL and given to his firm. “A businessmen who has not built a single airplane in his life and has a debt of ₹35000Cr was given the Rafale deal because of his relationship with PM. I have told the truth about the Prime Minister, and now he can't even meet my eye. He is not a 'Chowkidar', he is a 'Bhagidar',” he said. Continuing the barrage of attacks, Rahul then raised questions over prime minister's foreign policy and his government's decision to waive off loans rich businessmen and not that of poor farmers. Raising the issue of women safety in wake of reports of rapes from across the country, Gandhi said that for the first time in history, India's reputation is the worst in the world and blamed the prime minister for failing to protect India's women. Gandhi further added how Modi and Shah belong to a different category of politicians who can't afford to lose power. “If they do, other processes will begin. This fear is making them angry,” he said while adding how BJP lawmakers had congratulated him during the break when the house was adjourned. In the end, Rahul thanked Modi, BJP and RSS for teaching him the real meaning of being an Indian and a Hindu. Rahul's speech is certainly one of his best in the Lok Sabha which could further help in cementing his position as the leader of a united opposition in the run up to 2019 polls. His damning attack should inspire the opposition that was further stumped when the Amethi MP hugged the prime minister who got a taste of his own medicine considering his habit of hugging world leaders. The first round of the no-confidence debate belonged to Rahul but the Prime Minister, who is expected to use this opportunity to launch his 2019 campaign, is yet to speak. It remains to be be seen whether he can win the perception battle which, for now, seems to be in favour of the Congress president.",2018-07-20,, 'Bhagidar not chowkidar': Rahul attacks and then hugs Modi during No Confidence Motion | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bhagidar-not-chowkidar-rahul-attacks-and-then-hugs-modi-during-no-confidence-motion-123655.html
206,Rajeev Khanna,"After the extended Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Sunday, the media put up a question to the Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on a possible alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party ( ). Amarinder came out saying that the alliances will have to happen at the national level. “This is a decision to be taken at the national level. The alliances will be dependent on where the central leadership takes us. And wherever it takes us, we will go,” he reportedly said. Although it is a long way for the possibility such an alliance to come into existence but Amarinder and for that matter the Congress have nothing to lose as far as Punjab and to some extent Haryana are concerned. The Congress is likely to benefit if this alliance becomes a reality. These are the two states in the north where AAP has a presence apart from Delhi. One can start from taking stock of the political scenario in Punjab. AAP had come up with a surprising performance in the face of 'Modi wave' of 2014 by romping home on four of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in the offing in the state. It went on to emerge as a political force that was once threatening to form the government in this state in the Assembly polls held in 2017. But it was reduced to a distant second place by the resurgent Congress led by Amarinder. It is well known that the 2017 Congress victory in Punjab was out and out an Amarinder show with the central leadership having very little to do with it. But AAP's problems had started simultaneously along with its ascent. Of the four Lok Sabha MPs, Dr Dharamvira Gandhi, Harinder Singh Khalsa, Bhagwant Mann and Sadhu Singh, the first two were suspended by the party after the party witnessed a split when leaders like Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav moved out. Both these leaders continue to be the members of the lower house of the parliament as AAP's suspended members. They is no chance of AAP fielding them again in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Of the remaining two Sadhu Singh has remained in political oblivion. Bhagwant Mann had emerged as the key player for the party in the assembly polls drawing maximum crowds but his popularity also saw a down slide after the polls, particularly with allegations of high alcohol consumption against him being played up regularly by his political opponents. He had quit his post as AAP's Punjab chief when Delhi Chief Minister and AAP's national convener   apologised to Bikram Majithia. The party has been quiet over the acceptance of his resignation. There have been speculations about his continuing in AAP. But at the same time he continues to be the party's voice in the parliament and his speeches going viral. One also needs to look at AAP in the post 2017 Assembly poll scenario. The party has continued to go down the hill. Looking at its present scene one cannot believe that this was a party that was making waves ahead of the Assembly polls threatening to walk away with the victory crown with both the traditional power houses –Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Congress being cornered. Continuous squabbling among its over-ambitious leaders continue to present an embarrassing face of the party before the public. No one has been able to fill the party's top slot for long and there is a clear lack of co-ordination between the national and state leaderships of the party. Electorally speaking, the dismal state of affairs in AAP saw a total shift of its voter base towards the Congress in both the Gurdaspur parliamentary by-poll and the recent Shahkot Assembly by-poll. This clearly shows that the people who saw AAP as an alternative to the Congress in the fight against the SAD-  (BJP) combine are moving back to the Congress. AAP will have to come up with an elaborate blueprint if this is to be stopped. Meanwhile AAP's embarrassments continue. A couple of days back a fresh feud reportedly erupted in the party ranks, this time between its co-president Dr Balbir Singh and the Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly Sukhpal Singh Khaira. Monday morning saw two of its MLAs making headlines for being detained and deported from Canada. In such a scenario, an alliance between Congress and AAP would simply mean the former having an upper hand and the grand old party would not mind leaving two to three seats for AAP to contest in the Lok Sabha polls. The Congress prospects at this point of time remain bolstered, despite all the shortcomings, by the fact that the public anger against the Akali-BJP regime is yet to die down completely. Meanwhile in neighbouring Haryana, AAP is yet to make effective inroads in the heartland. The party can have some impact in the areas of the National Capital Region (NCR) around Delhi where its workers are trying to hard sell the Delhi model of governance and may capitalize on some seats. Here too AAP will have to play the second fiddle to the Congress. Although AAP has started strengthening its organization at the grass roots but it will take a lot of time for the party to get a firm footing on the turf of this politically high volatile state. According to AAP's Haryana in-charge Navin Jaihind the party has decided to open its offices in every state assembly constituency. The party is also engaged in a 'Hath Jodo' outreach campaign in the state.",2018-07-23,, Why Congress has nothing to lose in an alliance with AAP in north India | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-congress-has-nothing-to-lose-in-an-alliance-with-aap-in-north-india-124181.html

These questions were - Owaisi ended his sharp but fiery speech with the accusation that this regime has created an environment of fear in the country and has erected walls of hatred. You will win the motion today, but your government will fall in the next elections, he warned.Speaking in the Parliament is an art rarely practiced by Parliamentarians in India. What else can be concluded after listening to hundreds of MPs who waste the time that they get to speak in pointless bluster. The debate on the no-confidence motion against the   government also saw many such speakers who really did not make any meaningful contribution to the debate. Many MPs do not have a point to make. They became political leaders by chance and are not exposed to the full force of what it means to be the voice of 1.5 million people, the average size of a Lok Sabha constituency. Very little can be done about this variety. However, those MPs who do have a thing or two to say but do not know the best way to put it out there, can turn to their colleague  . The lone representative in the Parliament of the party that he heads - the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, Owaisi got all of 4 minutes to speak at the fag end of the debate during the No Confidence Motion on Friday. However, he didn’t allow time to become a constraint and made the most of whatever he had at his disposal. He told the Speaker is she could maintain the mood in the House as it was when the debate began in the morning, he had all of seven questions for the government. Pretty harmless, you would think. The BJP had been alloted a princely 3 and a half hours to defend its government’s performance. What difference could a single-member party in the Opposition make to the debate with all of 7 questions in 4 minutes. Thats where Owaisi’s skill comes in. As a three-time MP and a barrister-at-law, the 49-year old has mastered the art of speaking effectively in the Parliament, a craft very different from delivering speeches at public rallies. In Parliament, MPs do not have the luxury of time and get time to speak only in proportion to their party’s numerical strength. For three terms now, Owaisi has successfully shown how MPs from small parties can overcome this handicap by speaking in a concise and yet effective manner. He deploys a lethal combination of knowledge, command over the language and an uncanny ability to know just how much to say for maximum effect. His deftness was on display in all its glory during the no-trust vote debate too.    ",2018-07-21,," No Confidence Motion: Owaisi shows if you know where to hit, even 4 mins are enough | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/no-confidence-motion-owaisi-shows-if-you-know-where-to-hit-even-4-mins-are-enough-123837.html
208,Charu Kartikeya,"  Even as 65-year-old Samiuddin struggles to recover from his multiple wounds, new evidence has come to light that further accentuates the particularly sinister nature of the attack on him. The attack in which the elderly resident of Madapur village in Uttar Pradesh's Hapur district was grievously wounded also claimed the life of 45-year-old Qasim. Qasim was lynched by a mob on 18 June in Hapur's Bajhera Khurd village allegedly over suspicions that he was slaughtering cows. Samiuddin had reportedly rushed to the crime scene to mediate but he too was roughed up by the mob and, apparently, left for dead. The FIR lodged in the case in the name of Samiuddin's brother mentions the incident as a case of road-rage but videos of the incident that have gone viral on social media have firmly established the real reason behind the attack. In a fresh revelation that uncannily harks back to the lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Noida's Bisahra village in September 2015, Samiuddin's brother has now reportedly said that the size of the mob that attacked him and Qasim swelled after people were asked to assemble using the nearby temple's loudspeaker. Mohammad Yaseen, Samiuddin's 40-year old brother, told representatives of the National Alliance for People's Movement that his brother had gone to fetch fodder on the fateful day. Yaseen received word later that an altercation had broken out and his brother had been seriously wounded. He later learnt that the mob comprised 10-12 people initially but swelled following inciting announcements from the local temple's loudspeaker. Yaseen also said that at the hospital where his injured brother lay, there was hardly any security for them. This is surprising given the fact that Samiuddin, being a victim himself, is the only witness of Qasim's lynching. Yaseen also told NAPM that hospital staff was trying their best to keep journalists away from Samiuddin. According to NAPM, Samiuddin's relatives are bearing the expenses of his treatment themselves but they have not been handed over any document detailing the injuries and the treatment. Qasim's brother Nadeem told NAPM that when police handed over Qasim's dead body to them after the post-mortem, they said that since an FIR had already been filed from Samiuddin's side, no other FIR will be filed. Qasim was the sole bread-winner of his family which is presently surviving on food regularly brought by relatives. The NAPM team also met the officer in-charge of Pilkhuwa police station, Laxman Verma and asked him what progress had the police made in arresting the large number of young boys, seen in one of the viral videos, abusing Samiuddin and egging on his assailants. To their utter shock, Verma told the team that he had just returned after counseling the mothers of those boys for two and a half hours. When the activists reminded him that they were all party to the crime and should be arrested and produced in juvenile courts forthwith, Verma said he will look into it. NAPM's fact-finding mission has clearly revealed two things – that the lynching was more sinister than previously believed and that the administration is not serious in apprehending all the accused, protecting the only witness and ensuring the welfare of the victim's dependent family members. The lynching quite clearly appears to be another criminal outcome of the sinister cow-protection campaign that radical Hindutva outfits are running across the country. It is well-known that the BJP is sympathetic of this movement, if not party to it, but the governments run by the party are duty-bound to ensure the safety of citizens. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister   is free to keep and serve cows in his pastime but as the holder of a high Constitutional office, his foremost duty is to ensure that people are not killed under his watch. If this case flounders like the Akhlaq-lynching case, Adityanath will be massively failing in his duty, once again.  ",2018-06-27,, Hapur lynching: Victim's brother says mob swelled after calls from temple loudspeaker | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/hapur-lynching-victim-s-brother-says-mob-swelled-after-calls-from-temple-loudspeaker-119865.html
209,Rajeev Khanna,"Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has played a political masterstroke on the issue of compensation to the Jodhpur detainees who have been fighting a legal battle for getting compensation for their arrest from the Golden Temple complex during Operation Bluestar. Amarinder on Monday announced his government’s decision to pay the full compensation amount of Rs. 4.5 crore to these detainees if the Centre fails to come out with its share. This has helped him score some quick brownie points against both the   (BJP) led central government and its ally the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had booked the 375 detainees under Explosives Act and Arms Act. All of them were released in three phases between 1989 and 1991 and out of these 224 appealed for compensation alleging 'wrongful detention and torture'. But the CBI had contested his demand and had won the case in the lower court in 2011. While several of these detainees died and many refused to pursue the matter further, there were 40 people who appealed against the order before the Amritsar sessions court and were awarded Rs 4 lakh each as compensation with six per cent interest in a judgment last year. While Punjab was willing to pay its share of the compensation, the Centre had approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the order of the sessions court. The compensation amounts to a paltry sum of Rs 4.5 crore. Amarinder made his intention clear after a telephonic conversation with Union home secretary Rajiv Gauba whom he had called up to urge for early resolution of the matter in view of the prolonged suffering of the detainees. Expressing hope that the Centre would be forthcoming with its 50 per cent share of the compensation, Amarinder said that if, for any reason, the Union government fails to pay its share then the state government would take over the entire liability and ensure that the detainees get thee much-delayed justice. Amarinder had taken up the matter with Gauba since the Union home minister is abroad. Pointing that these detainees have been suffering for the past several years for no fault of theirs, he called for a standardized policy to deal with such cases. He sought that the Centre immediately withdraw its appeal in the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the compensation ordered. Amarinder had last week written to Rajnath pointing out that the central government’s appeal against the compensation, which the court had held to be jointly payable by the union and state governments, had evoked a strong reaction among the Sikh community. He had warned that it was further likely to lead to an avoidable sense of alienation and perceived injustice among the community. Amarinder had been approached by a delegation of the detainees on Saturday. The issue of compensation had gained centrestage in Punjab politics over the last few days. In a bid to score points, the Akalis had last week sent a delegation to Rajnath who had given them an assurance from that the Jodhpur detainees would get their just dues. The Akalis had also asked the home minister to expedite release of all Sikh prisoners who are still languishing in jails after completion of their jail term. The Akali delegation led by union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had also urged Rajnath to declassify all papers related with Operation Bluestar so that the role of the Congress party as well as that of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi could be brought before the people. The delegation had told Rajnath that now when an opportunity has arisen to give partial closure to the sufferings, the CBI has moved an application in the Punjab and Haryana high court appealing against the judgment of the session’s court. The delegation said this move had hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community worldwide because the CBI had followed the UPA government stand on this issue. It said this stand needed to change under the NDA government led by  . With his move Amarinder has put the ball in the Centre's court and has cornered the Akalis who have been attacking the Congress for all that happened during the dark days of militancy. Observers feel that the move by Amarinder would once again draw the radical Sikh elements opposed to the Akalis to support him. “Amarinder always had a following among a section of the radical Sikhs who have respected him for speaking out against the injustice to the community. His resignation from the Lok Sabha after Operation Bluestar despite being on very good terms with the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had earned him respect. He had also quit the state government led by Surjit Singh Barnala for playing to the tune of Rajiv Gandhi government at the Centre and allowing the searches in the Golden Temple complex by the security forces. But in the run up to the last assembly polls, radical Sikhs had shown support for the rookie Aam Aadmi Party ( ). To balance this Amarinder had made overtures to the Hindu community, mainly small traders, who had been traditional BJP voters. This support base had voted for the Congress, punishing the Akali-BJP combine for the misrule and demonetisation brought about by Modi. They were also wary of AAP coming to power with the support of Sikh hardliners,” pointed a political observer. He further pointed that when it comes to Panthic politics also, it is Amarinder who has been taking on the Akalis. The Congress has tried to counter the NDA narrative on injustice to Sikhs by pointing that while its leadership had apologised in Parliament for both the Operation Bluestar and 1984 anti-Sikh pogronm would Modi do the same for the Gujarat pogrom against Muslims? The move by Amarinder would surely take out some sting from the Akali attack as the parties warm up for the Lok Sabha battle of 2019 where the Congress would try to perform better than the last time.",2018-06-26,, Amarinder corners BJP and Akalis on compensation to Jodhpur detainees | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/amarinder-corners-bjp-and-akalis-on-compensation-to-jodhpur-detainees-119708.html
210,Charu Kartikeya,"It is perhaps quite predictable for the BJP to be creating diversions upon diversions at this juncture. Along with this year's heavy electoral calendar – the Lok Sabha elections are less than a year away and the BJP is attracting intense scrutiny over its performance in power at the Centre. The party has failed to keep many of the promises it made in the run up to the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. To avoid uncomfortable questions over this failure, it appears to have adopted a single-track approach of only attacking the Congress and other Opposition parties and that too, over non-issues. In comes the campaign to hold press conferences across the country focused on recalling the excesses of the Emergency era. What, pray, do Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi's actions from four decades ago have to do with the   government's performance? In the same league is BJP chief  's speech delivered in Kolkata yesterday, delivering the first Bankim Chandra Chattapadhyay memorial lecture. Shah said in his speech that the Congress party's act of censoring Chattapadhyay's 'Vande Mataram' song led to India's partition in 1947. ""Had the Congress not made the mistake of censoring the national song Vande Mataram to just stanzas instead of the whole song, we could have stopped India from getting divided,"" Shah said. ""Historians blame the Khilafat movement or the Muslim League's two-nation theory for India's partition. But I am sure that the appeasement politics that Congress introduced by censoring Vande Mataram as a national anthem led to the country's partition in the long run,"" he added. Chattopadhyaya wrote 'Vande Mataram' in 1870s and included it in his 1881 novel Anandamath. The song became a popular instrument for rousing nationalistic sentiment during the freedom struggle years later. Leading the struggle, the   adopted two stanzas from it as the ""national song"" in 1937. A committee consisting of Maulana Azad, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Bose, Acharya Deva and Rabrindanath Tagore is believed to have recommended the adoption. The remaining part of the poem was carefully avoided as it contained worship references to Hindu gods and goddesses, which might be problematic for people from other communities. This was as secular a gesture as any and it is only to the credit of BJP's propaganda machinery that it has been able to find appeasement in this. For a national song, it is important to inspire a collective sense of nationalism among those singing it, which explains the selection of Vande Mataram and the simultaneous omission of the controversial stanzas. In fact, many have argued that the context behind the song, Anandmath's plot, had communal   and if the song was adopted in full, that would have certainly indicated widespread endorsement of the said communal  . However, the real question that Shah and his colleagues are trying to run away from is not whether Anandmath had a communal agenda or not. That question is – what has Anandmath, just like the Emergency, got to do with the Modi-government's performance? Shah's focus on the Vande Mataram conspiracy is akin to the messages circulated by RSS sympathisers on social media platforms like WhatsApp. When will he and his party bid-goodbye to this WhatsApp-level discourse and address the real questions at hand?",2018-06-28,, From Emergency to Vande Mataram: When will BJP quit using WhatsApp-level diversionary tactics? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/from-emergency-to-vande-mataram-when-will-bjp-quit-using-whatsapp-level-diversionary-tactics-120028.html
211,Rajeev Khanna,"The grand old party is in the pits once again in Gujarat. Having put up an exceptional performance in the recent assembly polls, the Congressmen are back to their old ways of squabbling and gunning for each other. It comes as a surprise that a party that has out of power for more than two decades still witnesses these games and tussle of one-upmanship. The state of affairs can be gauged from a joke cracked by one of the Congress leaders to this reporter when he said, “We were told by our president   to fight against the   and   led   (BJP). In our zeal we have all forgotten about Modi, Shah and the BJP and instead have taken to fighting with each other.” This time the eye of the storm has been triggered from the all important Saurashtra region that sends almost one third of the MLAs to the state assembly. A few days back, former Congress MLA and a high profile leader from Rajkot, Indranil Rajyaguru, announced his departure from the party, Rajyaguru had unsuccessfully contested the last polls against the Chief Minister Vijay Rupani from the Rajkot (West) seat that is a traditional bastion of the BJP. Reports say that he was not happy with the functioning of the state unit of the party. He has proceeded on a visit abroad even as his resignation stands unaccepted as of now. His resignation was followed by 17 municipal corporators in Rajkot extending support to him and threatening to quit the party on Tuesday unless he was brought back into the party fold and his demands were met. In a parallel development another Congress leader Nirav Bakshi reportedly quit the party along with his 200 supporters when he did not get the expected presidentship of the party’s city unit. His supporters created mayhem at the state headquarters of the party in Paldi area of Ahmedabad as they stormed a media briefing of the state president Amit Chavda who was attempting to send out the message that all was well in the party. Bakshi is a former city head of the Youth Congress and son of former city chief Surendra Bakshi. In Rajkot, Rajyaguru's resignation was preceded by his arch rival in the party and Jasdan MLA Kunwarji Bavaliya calling on Rahul Gandhi in Delhi. It is learnt that Rahul has offered him a greater role in the organisational set up at the central level. But even Bavaliya is not said to be happy and the message that he sent out after a meeting with his supporters at Jasdan was that his supporters wanted him to 'think differently'. Apart from Bavaliya, Rajyaguru and Bakshi, there have been other voices of discontent also that have been raised over the last few weeks. Leaders like Jivabhai Patel, Vikram Madam, Javed Hussain Pirzada have reportedly expressed their dissatisfaction at the state of affairs. A point to be noted here is that the top shots of the party who were once seen as chief minister probables ahead of the assembly polls and had lost are nowhere to be seen. These include leaders like Arjun Modhwadia, Siddharth Patel and Bharatsinh Solanki. Party's Gujarat in-charge Rajiv Satav was scheduled to meet the state leadership at Gandhinagar on Thursday evening to find a solution to the crisis. The question remains why this has happened. Senior political analyst from Rajkot Suresh Samani says,” There are many reasons for this. One, the infighting is in the DNA of the Congress and Gujarat is not exception. Two, there is no mass leader having a pan Gujarat image in the party. The last such leaders that the party had were Chimanbhai Patel and Shankersinh Vaghela. The fact is that nobody knows Amit Chavda in Saurashtra and nobody knew Bakshi till the time reported on him.” He further pointed out, “The impact of horse trading trickling down to even the local bodies is now being felt. At many places the Congress has maximum number in these bodies but at the same time the local leaders are ambitious and want posts and designation. When they do not these, they are willing to defect to the other party for the lure of money. The game is that if there is no power coming your way why not get some money. The Congress' problem gets further complicated because it is facing both a leadership and economic crisis to manage such elements.” There is already a buzz that the BJP has started making its moves ahead of the Lok Sabha polls and would encourage defections of influential Congress leaders. Sources said that it should not come as a surprise if the BJP offers to field Bavaliya from Surendranagar Lok Sabha seats. It is a major challenge for the Congress to keep its flock together. Another perception on the present crisis plaguing the party is that the youth leadership coming to prominence after the Gujarat polls has not gone down well with the old guard. Gujarat now has a young state president in Amit Chavda an a young Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader in Paresh Dhanani. “Ours is a party where people are not ready to give up their posts even after attaining the age of 80 years. They do not want to hand over the baton even to their own grandsons,” said a party insider. Party spokesperson Manish Doshi claims, “The recent developments are just a fall out of the transition that is going in the party. The young leadership is settling down. The party has a youthful team holding the position of state president, CLP leader and even the All India Congress Committee in-charge for the state. The party will resolve the issues by taking the senior leaders into confidence. Their experience will be utilised for taking the party further.” The party will have to act quick to meet the challenge of holding its flock together if it wants to put up a formidable challenge against the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls. The party had fares dismally in the last parliamentary elections failing to win even a single of the 26 seats. Spruced by a good performance in the assembly polls, the party's top leadership is looking for a much better performance in 2019. But this will only happen if it does away with what is known as the 'Congress culture of infighting' and puts its house in order.",2018-06-28,, Revival proves short-lived: Gujarat Congress back to its old habit of infighting  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/revival-proves-short-lived-gujarat-congress-back-to-its-old-habit-of-infighting-120026.html
212,Riyaz Wani,"Post break-up, the BJP and PDP are at war. And ironically both of them are accusing each other of not living up to the Agenda of Alliance (AoA). During his grand rally in Jammu to mark ""historic martyrdom anniversary"" of Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee, BJP leader   said that the  -led government did not implement any of the programmes framed by the central government. He also accused the PDP of discriminating against Jammu and Ladakh. In response, Mehbooba said the discrimination against Jammu and Ladakh had no basis in reality as the BJP was an equal partner in the coalition government and its ministers “largely represented Jammu region"". Mehbooba said her party’s commitment to the ‘Agenda of the Alliance’, the pact reached between the two sides in 2015, never wavered. Mehbooba also said that it was sad to see the saffron party disown its own initiative and label it as a ""soft approach"". So what is the truth? Which party is lying and which is telling the truth? Let us do the reality-check. Truth is that the Agenda of Alliance has largely been implemented in breach. Let us check the coalition’s performance on some of the key points in the agenda. AoA promise: The coalition government will seek to support and strengthen the approach and initiatives taken by the government to create a reconciliatory environment and build stakes for all in the peace and development within the sub-continent. Reality: Indo-Pak relations have plunged to their lowest lows in the past four years. New redlines marked by the Centre for dialogue with the neighbour which includes bar on Islamabad talking to Hurriyat and the intermittent high-profile terror attacks from across the border have ensured that the dialogue between the countries hasn’t got off the ground. AoA promise: The present position will be maintained on all the constitutional provisions pertaining to J&K including the special status in the Constitution of India. Reality: Though at a political level the BJP has chosen to largely lie low about its longstanding position on the sensitive issue, J&K’s special constitutional position has faced increasing legal challenge in recent years. Several petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court, one of them by the RSS allied Kashmir Study Group, against Article 35A, the constitutional provision extended to the state by the president of India in 1954 which enables the state government to define the state subject and forbid outsiders from settling in the state to preserve the existing demographic composition of the state. AoA promise: Examine the need for de-notifying disturbed areas enabling Union government to take a final view on the continuation of AFSPA. Reality: The BJP went back on the commitment soon after forming the coalition government. However, the progressive deterioration in the security situation and the resurgence of militancy – contributed no less by the muscular policy of the Centre – dented the PDP’s argument for AFSPA's revocation. AoA promise: Will strengthen cross-LOC trade, encourage civil society exchange, open new routes. Reality: Once dubbed as the biggest Confidence Building Measure between India and Pakistan, the cross-LoC trade now struggles and has become less and less profitable. For one, the trade has not moved beyond barter system and the Union government has not taken any step towards opening new routes, increasing trade commodities from current 21 and start telephone services between the two sides. AoA on internal dialogue: The coalition government will facilitate and help initiate a sustained and meaningful dialogue with all internal stakeholders to build a broad based consensus on resolution of all outstanding issues of J&K. Reality: From the day one of this coalition, the Centre has refused to engage with the separatists. In fact in April 2017, the Centre told the Supreme Court it was ready to talk to only recognised political parties in Jammu and Kashmir to resolve the crisis but not to the separatists. It also opened investigations against the separatists over their alleged role in funding militancy in the state and has since put seven of them including the top separatist Shabir Shah behind bars. Though, following the announcement of the Ramadan ceasefire, Centre did make noises to the effect of being open to talks with the separatists, but it has never made a formal offer to the Hurriyat, expecting them to present themselves for talks. The situation is now back to square one AoA on power projects: Explore modalities for transfer of Dulhasti and Uri hydro power projects to J&K as suggested by the Rangarajan Committee Report and the Round Table reports. Revise all royalty agreements. Reality: There has virtually been no progress on this. In fact, the then Union Power Minister   made it clear in the first few months of the coalition government that no power project was going to be transferred to J&K government. The minister also ruled out revision of royalty agreements between the state and NHPC on the latter’s owned projects in the state. AoA on flood relief: Rehabilitation and Relief for the Flood Affected victims and their families: The Government of India (GoI) must fully fund the rehabilitation and reconstruction plan. Rs 44,000 crores demand made by previous government. Reality: It took the Centre, fourteen months to release the flood relief package to the state. The amount released was a meagre Rs 7,854 crore against Rs 44,000 crore sought by the state government. A part of this money had also to be spent on the river Tawi flood reconstruction project in Jammu. Yes, both Jammu and Srinagar got the smart city status in line with the agreements in Agenda of Alliance. Also an AIIMS like hospital has been sanctioned each for Jammu and Srinagar, again a commitment made in the AoA. So the state government has hardly been a success. On the contrary, the coalition has always been hobbled by the recurrent political and ideological confrontation between the partners which in turn has affected the governance. Besides, more often than not the BJP’s ideological overreach has brought the state to the edge of political chaos. J&K at the end of the four year PDP-BJP rule is worse than it ever was since the early nineties. Militancy has staged a return with a vengeance. More local youth are taking up arms undeterred by the Operation All-Out and the Valley is once again rife with the separatist sentiment.",2018-06-28,, PDP-BJP war of words: How both parties failed to fulfill their promises | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/pdp-bjp-war-of-words-how-both-parties-failed-to-fulfilli-their-promises-119707.html
213,Sulagna Sengupta,"Former President of India  's visit to the   headquarters in Nagpur appears to have helped the saffron outfit win more followers in West Bengal. RSS functionaries in the state say that their membership has increased substantially after Mukherjee's visit. Biplab Roy, RSS publicity secretary for South Bengal, said “Before Pranab Mukherjee's visit, the number of applicants as registered in the RSS website from all over India was about 378 everyday. On 7 June, it was 1779. And out of that figure, 40% are from Bengal. And it is increasing with each passing day. This shows how people have responded to his visit” According to Roy, normally in a day the RSS receives around 300-400 applications on its website . Now it has increased to 1100-1200 applications per day on an average. Roy said “Although RSS membership is increasing because of the good work the organisation has undertaken in the past few years, Mukherjee's visit definitely given a boost. We hope that it increases further in the coming days.” On 7 June, Mukherjee visited the RSS headquarters in Nagpur, inviting criticism from his own Congress party. The RSS made most of the controversy and began cashing in on Mukherjee's visit especially in his home state West Bengal where the outfit is engaged in a pitched battle with the ruling All India Trinamool Congress. “We are rapidly expanding in Bengal. In South Bengal last year we had 850 shakhas and this year it has increased to more than 1200. In North Bengal it has increased from 300 to 400,'' disclosed RSS general secretary for Eastern India Jishnu Bose. The Congress and CPI(M) both admit that Mukherjee's visit made RSS more acceptable, especially in West Bengal. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury West Bengal Pradesh Congress chief said “By paying a visit to an RSS programme at Nagpur, Pranab babu proved his relevance while the RSS gained acceptability.” According to Mohammad Salim of the CPI(M), “What we feared is now happening.

214,Anurag Dey,"Describing the arrests as “political vendetta”, Sussan Abraham, the counsel for the five activists said the entire Maoist conspiracy and the slapping of UAPA was done to shield Bhide, Ekbote and the Hindutva brigade which was behind the 1 January violence. “This is nothing but political vendetta. None of the five were named in the initial FIR. Only in March the case was converted into criminal conspiracy and in April, Gadling was first named. All the five have been working for Dalits and adivasis for years and are renowned for raising their voices against human rights violations,” Abraham told Catch. Talking about the draconian UAPA, Abraham said the law with its sweeping definition of terrorist and unlawful activities, can get anyone and everyone booked. “Unlike the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, (TADA) and the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (POTA), the UAPA doesn’t have any ‘sunset clause’ ie, a provision of periodic review of the law. (Under sunset clause, a law shall cease to have effect after a specific date, unless further legislative action is taken to extend it). “In that sense it is far worse than TADA and POTA. Moreover, with successive amendments it has only become more dangerous and has been rendered only as a tool of political vendetta, a tool to settle scores and stifle dissent,” said Abraham. “In sharp contrast, we have seen how Hindu right-wingers accused in cases like Malegaon, Ajmer Dargah, Samjhauta Express, Mecca Masjid etc have been getting bailed or acquitted,” she added. The highly abused POTA that was repealed in 2004 by the United Progressive Alliance, appears to exist in the form of UAPA, as all its controversial provisions have been included in the latest anti-terror law. The BJP is not alone in abusing the UAPA. The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress administration in West Bengal has used the anti-terror law against a host of protestors who have been opposing a Power Grid Corp of India Ltd (PGCIL) project at Bhangar in South 24 Parganas district. Excessive powers to arrest, detain: Under the sweeping powers offered by the Act, an accused can be detained without a charge-sheet for up to 180 days and in police custody up to 30 days. Under any offence under the Indian Penal Code, the period of such detention is up to 90 days where the investigation relates to an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years and 60 days where the investigation relates to any other offence. Moreover, the UAPA also creates a strong presumption against bail and assumption of guilt for terrorism offences merely based on the evidence allegedly seized. Onus of proof on the accused: India follows an adversarial justice system under which an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The onus of proving the guilt is on the prosecution. In sharp contrast, under the UAPA, the onus of proof is on the accused to prove his innocence. Criminalises ideology: The UAPA through its sweeping definitions empowers declaring any organisation ‘unlawful’ or ‘terrorist’ and banning it, which in effect criminalises the ideology followed by the organisation members. As such, mere possession of any literature supporting that ideology can be taken as an offence under the Act. Not just that membership or association with such an organisation also becomes punishable. This provision has often been used by the authorities to silence activists fighting for tribal or Dalit rights. A classic example in this regard is public health specialist and celebrated activist Binayak Sen who was given a life term for aiding and associating with Maoist leader Narayan Sanyal. In the case of the arrests of the five accused, the police have claimed to have seized “incriminating documents” indicating their links with “Maoist outfits”. Speaking on the issue activist and People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) Secretary Kavita Srivastava said the mere association or even a piece of paper can get one convicted under the UAPA. “UAPA in the hands of the government is a hammer with which it is crushing voices that speak for the voiceless. From Binayak Sen to professor GN Saibaba and now these five activists we have seen how the UAPA has been used as a political tool. “UAPA is draconian because it criminalises association, it criminalises ideology and criminalises even intent. A mere paper in your possession can get you convicted for life,” Srivastava told Catch. Both Abraham and Srivastava cited the Gadchiroli Maoists case to point out the ugly face of UAPA. In 2017, a court in Gadchiroli sentenced wheelchair-bound Delhi University professor Saibaba and four others to life imprisonment. Suffering from 90% disability, Saibaba along with Hem Mishra, Prashant Rahi, Mahesh Tirki and Pandu Narote were sentenced under UAPA for aiding and abetting Naxal activities. Among the incriminating articles seized by the police from Saibaba included CDs—with titles like “Video on Sri Lankan War Crimes,” “A Few Myths & Facts About Salwa Judum Concentration Camps,” etc. On the other hand, Tirki was condemned for life on the basis of documents recovered from his possession that included a pamphlet that opposed the Surjagarh mining project in Gadchiroli, the 2006 Khairlanji massacre and Operation Green Hunt Incidentally Gadling was the lawyer defending Saibaba and others in the Gadchiroli Naxal case. Among others to fall prey to the UAPA are Bastar-based journalists Santosh Yadav and Somaru Nag, who were arrested by Chhattisgarh Police for “links with Naxals and of involvement in operations against the security forces”. Both were later released after months of incarceration. “UAPA has been used mostly to targets tribals and Dalits who have dared to raise their voices in protest. Thousands of them are behind bars across the country, facing charges under UAPA. Pending trial, they are rotting in jails for years. “One can go on and on talking about how draconian UAPA is and how it has destroyed lives of people across the country especially tribals and Dalits. While governments across the country have been using to suppress resistance, the BJP regime appears to have perfected the art. The only way to prevent further damage is to immediately repeal it ,” said Srivastava. Condemning the arrests of Dhawale, Gadling, Raut, Sen and Wilson, rights activists Shabnam Hashmi said the slapping of UAPA was the culmination of the BJP’s witch-hunt against Dalit and tribal rights activists. “Ever since the Narendra Modi government came to power, it has been targeting activists and organisations working for tribals, Dalits and the marginalised sections of the society. From unleashing probe agencies, to canceling licenses to arresting activists the saffron brigade has gone all out in its bid to stifle the voices that rise against it. The imposition of UAPA on activists at the drop of a hat is the culmination of that,” Hashmi told Catch. Hashmi founded the Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD) a NGO in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots. The Union Home Ministry in 2016 had cancelled foreign funding registration of ANHAD citing ""undesirable activities against public interest"".The   (BJP) had cited fundamental rights, including right to life and free speech of the people of Jammu & Kashmir being in danger, as one of its reasons for pulling the plug off the alliance with the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP). But when it comes to infringing the fundamental rights and personal liberty of individuals, the saffron regime has been tenacious in using the draconian UAPA or the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The Raj-era legacy of using ruthless laws to stifle dissent has been carried forward with aplomb by successive governments in independent India and BJP regimes have been no different, using the UAPA as a tool to settle political scores or to crush voices rising against it. Coming into force in 1967, UAPA since then has been amended thrice in 2004, 2008 and 2012 to become increasingly repressive, regressive and draconian. The latest victims of one of the most controversial laws are five activists -- all working for the society’s most marginalised sections -- arrested in connection with the violence surrounding the annual celebrations at Bhima Koregoan memorial. The Pune police on 6 June arrested and slapped UAPA charges on writer and Dalit rights activist Sudhir Dhawale, advocate Surendra Gadling, activist on displacement issues Mahesh Raut, university professor Shoma Sen and social activist Rona Wilson. It has been over three weeks since the five were condemned behind bars but the zealot police continue to explore ways to intensify their culpability. From holding them liable for the violence at Bhima Koregaon to supporting and aiding Maoists to finally indicting them of conspiring to assassinate Prime Minister   in a ""Rajiv Gandhi-type"" incident, the police have changed their versions in order to justify the imposition of the stringent UAPA provisions. Having worked all their life for the most marginalised sections of the society including Dalits and tribals, the five now face charges that include “intent to strike terror in the people of India”, “intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security, economic security, or sovereignty of India” and “raising funds knowing that such funds are likely to be used by a terrorist organisation to commit a terrorist act”. Claiming the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) to be behind the entire conspiracy, the police have now entirely taken away the focus from Hindutva leaders Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote, the duo booked for orchestrating the violence in Bhima Koregaon on 1 January.",2018-06-28,, How the Modi govt is using UAPA as a weapon to suppress dissent | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/how-the-modi-govt-is-using-uapa-as-a-weapon-to-suppress-dissent-120030.html

216,Sulagna Sengupta,"  A day after BJP president  's visit to two Dalit families at Lagda village in West Bengal's Purulia, the two families joined the All India Trinamool Congress on Friday. Four family members of the two families – Sanjoy Rajwar, his mother Sishubala Rajwar , Fuchun Rajwar and Ashtami Rajwar – joined AITC in the presence of the party leaders Madan Mitra and Dr Shantanu Sen. Shah had visited the families on Thursday. Recalling Shah's visit, 23-year-old Fuchun Rajwar said, “As a part of the Jan Sampark Karyakram, Shah handed over some leaflets to us. But we know only Mamata Di. We joined Trinamool Congress on Friday as we support Didi. Shah told us to join BJP. But we did not want to join their party. We are committed to AITC.” According to the members of the family, the state government has provided enough benefits for BPL card-holders such as the move to provide Rs 2 per kilo rice to all BPL card holders. Fuchun's mother Ashtami Rajwar said “When Shah visited our house, we offered him a chair and he told us to join their party. We voted for Didi as she has brought development in our village. There were no good schools in our locality. But after Didi came to power, she has set up three new schools in our locality. Now our children do not have to go to another village for their education.” “Didi often visits Purulia. Earlier we didn't have proper roads. But they were built after Didi came to power. There are some other issues that need to be addressed and we hope the government would do that,” she adds. According to Fuchun's wife Himani Rajwar,“ When Shah came to meet our family, he offered us a leaflet containing the achievements of the   government and urged us to vote for the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. He was accompanied by state president Dilip Ghosh and other senior BJP state leaders.” AITC leader Madan Mitra accused the BJP of making people join the party by force. “BJP leaders threatened the families and told them to join their party. It’s a matter of great concern. However the families support AITC and they came on Friday morning to our party office and expressed their desire to join the party. We immediately took up the matter our party chief Mamata Banerjee and the families have been inducted into our party.” According to Mitra, BJP leaders who are siting in Delhi often come to Bengal just to create disturbance. “They need to work more to strengthen their party base in Bengal. In other states they can get votes by splurging money, but not in Bengal”. This is not the first time that AITC has pulled of such a coup on Amit Shah. On May 3, 2017 Shah went to Naxalbari and ate lunch in the house of a tribal family. But a week after later, the families joined AITC. While BJP leaders allege that the tribal couple was kidnapped and forced to join Trinamool Congress, AITC leaders claimed that they were supporters of the party and joined on their own volition. Responding to the the act of the tribal families in Purulia, BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said “Amit Shah went to meet the families as a part of the Jan Sampark Karyakram. Trinamool Congress leaders are threatened by Shah's presence so they kidnapped and forced the families to join their party. We have received information that after Shah left, the state police came to the homes of these families at Lagda village and took them to the AITC office in Kolkata. This is not the way to stop the growth of BJP in West Bengal. We will continue our Jan Sampark Karyakram, despite the AITC 's threat .""  ",2018-06-30,," 'We know only Mamata di': Purulia tribal families visited by Amit Shah, join Trinamool | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/we-know-only-mamata-di-purulia-tribal-families-visited-by-amit-shah-join-trinamool-120338.html

According to her, the resignation letter stated how she loved working here and thanked the team for giving her the opportunity. She went on to add that the party's complaint committee does not have any complaint written/verbal/official/unofficial from the ex-worker. Former Congress member Shehzad Poonawala alleged that the party is pressurising the victim to retract her complaint by forming some “eyewash committee”. He further alleged that the victim has even written to Congress President   about the harassment but the latter chose to ignore it.     Meanwhile, sensing an opportunity to score political gains over the Congress on women's safety, BJP is expected to launch a full blown attack on the Congress. This controversy is unlike to die down anytime soon.  A woman, who was formerly employed with the Congress' social media team, led by Divya Spandana, has accused a senior colleague in the same department of sexual misconduct. The woman on Tuesday filed a formal complaint with Delhi Police and accused one Chirag Patnaik of making her uncomfortable with “frequent violation of her personal space” and “immoral behaviour”. Based on the complaint, the Delhi Police filed an FIR against Patnaik under Section 354-A and 509 at North Avenue police station. The Delhi Police swung into action after BJP held a press conference and requested them to initiate action to ensure safety of the woman. In her complaint, the woman further alleged that she had informed Spandana about Patnaik's misconduct who didn't pay any heed to it. Further, she alleged that Spandana, who heads Congress' social media team, refused to listen to her complaint and diverted the topic to her work performance related issues. In her complaint, she claimed that initially she tolerated Patnaik's behaviour out of the fear of losing her job. “ However, towards the end of my tenure, even on 22nd of May 2018; I made several verbal and non-verbal communications of a strong disapproval of his misbehaviour,” she has claimed. The woman accused Spandana of humiliating her with insulting work related messages on the office group. “This frequent misbehaviour of Mr Patnaik, coupled with Miss Divya Spandana's arrogant attitude had rendered the working place intolerable. As a result, I resigned on 17th of May citing psychological disturbance,” she alleged. Meanwhile, Spandana and her team came out in support of Patnaik and claimed that there was no reason to believe that Patnaik had misbehaved with the complainant. “The team has also come out in support of the current worker based on their interactions and experience of working with him. The team has also recalled some of their conversations with the ex-worker and has no reason to believe that the current worker could have misbehaved with the ex-worker,” read Spandana's statement.  ",2018-07-03,, Congress IT cell rocked by sexual misconduct allegation by former employee | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/congress-it-cell-rocked-by-sexual-misconduct-allegation-by-former-employee-120778.html
218,Rajeev Khanna,"With the video of Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat snapping at a school teacher in his 'Janata Darbar', ordering her detention and suspension going viral, it is yet another moment of embarrassment for the government in Uttarakhand as it continues to draw flak from all corners. Uttara Bahuguna, a 57-year-old school principal wanted to be transferred to Dehradun after having spent more than two decades in the remote Uttarkashi district. Her loud exchange of words with Rawat was caught on camera with the latter ordering action against her. Ironically, Rawat's own wife Sunita Rawat who is also a teacher was reportedly transferred out of a difficult station within four years of service and has been working in Dehradun ever since. The wives of several other politicians from various parties and also of officers have been enjoying plum postings at places of their choice. But all this should not come as a surprise because this is not the first instance of the people of this hill state being failed by the government. In almost two decades of its existence the honest, sincere and hard-working people of this small hill state have been let down repeatedly by both its political and administrative class. The state of affairs makes one ponder why carving out a small state which was meant for providing ideal governance to the underdeveloped parts of erstwhile Uttar Pradesh has proved to be a failed experiment where the issues that were meant to be addressed remain the same as a sense of dejection and disillusionment has set in the common folk. How would one explain the conduct of the political class in this state that has seen nine changes to the top post of chief minister in just 18 years of its existence? One also needs to recount what have these nine folk been famous or infamous for. It was on November 9, 2000 that the state had come into existence with Nityanand Swami being the first chief minister. A RSS man, Swami was never allowed to settle by his fellow   (BJP) leaders. His cabinet colleagues Bhagat Singh Koshiyari and Ramesh Pokhariyal Nishank had initially refused to take oath. His short stint was marked by setting the house in order and all this while Koshiyari, Nishank and others kept up the pressure to get him replaced on the grounds that he was a 'non Pahari'. Just before the 2002 polls, Koshiyari managed to replace him. He had nothing to show during his short tenure that lasted just four months. The BJP was in for a massive shock in the first Assembly polls of 2002 that saw the people voting for the Congress. It was the son of the soil Narayan Datt Tiwari who became the chief minister. Ironically, here was a man who had once reportedly said that Uttarakhand would come into existence over his dead body. But still, he is seen as a leader who did make efforts for the betterment of this hill state despite the fact that corruption spiraled. During his tenure it was none other than his own party man Harish Rawat who acted as the main opposition. Yet Tiwari remains the only leader till now to have completed a full five year term as the state's chief minister. Power once again went back to the BJP in the 2007 polls and this time it was Major General (Retired) BC Khanduri who was made the chief minister. Khanduri had a successful term as the surface transport minister in the Atal Behari Vajpayee led NDA government in the Centre. He tried his bit to bring around some improvements. He was the man who brought about a transfer law in the state which is yet to be implemented properly. But his trying to run the state government like a 'Military Brigade' and being misled by his bureaucrats proved to be his bane. Besides his tenure was marked by frequent imposition of electoral model code of conduct. With the BJP getting whitewashed in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, he was replaced by Nishank. This time again it was the Koshiyari-Nishank duo at work. Nishank's tenure was disastrous as more effort was made to spruce up his image than on governance. Come to think of it, here was a man who set up a committee at a cost of several crores to search the mythological 'Sanjeevni Booti' in a scenario when many of the hospitals and dispensaries in the state were unable to provide even life saving drugs to the people. The search for the mythological plant continues in the successive tenures. Sycophants ruled the roost. His tenure was marked by withdrawals of controversial decisions. Owing to his disastrous performance, the BJP faced the choice of being 'booted out' or 'voted out' in 2012 polls. Showing wisdom it chose the latter and brought back Khanduri who came up with a fighting performance. In his second tenure he displayed political will and commitment as he went around executing several road projects. He also introduced the Lokayukta Bill. But he lost his own seat in the polls, thanks to the sabotage from within the party. In came Vijay Bahuguna as the next Congress chief minister. His tenure was lacklustre till the time the Kedarnath disaster struck. He started holding brief assembly sessions in Gairsain to fizzle out the agitation for having a permanent capital there. Observers say the tradition continues but at the same time shows the hypocrisy of the ruling governments as after four or five days everyone is back to Dehradun and the plains. “When the government itself does not want to go to the hills, how can it expect the people to remain there ? This reflects in villages being abandoned and employees not willing to work in 'difficult' areas,” points out a political observer based in Dehradun. Bahuguna was replaced by Harish Rawat who went on to contest the next polls banking on the rehabilitation work done after the tragedy. His tenure again was marked by empty announcements and this resulted in his electoral loss from two seats, one in the hills and one in the plains. After a landslide victory in 2017 polls, RSS grooming and closeness to Prime Minister   and BJP's national president   saw the elevation of Trivendra Singh Rawat to the chief ministerial post. Observers say that his tenure also has nothing to project as a major achievement. He has been trying to emulate Modi in his mannerism and actions only to be smirked upon by his detractors. “The perception is that he has become all the more arrogant after the recent win of the party in the Tharali by-poll and bringing Modi to Dehradun for the International Yoga Day event. Besides Shah was also in Dehradun a few days back. Many people refer to him as Chhota Shah,” pointed the political observer. When such is the scenario of the political class, what can one expect from the administrative officials? Observers say that at the time of creation of the state some of the most incompetent an dishonest bureaucrats in erstwhile Uttar Pradesh opted for the Uttarakhand cadre and they have been calling the shots. “The politicians are just bothered about getting their own petty works done and are inefficient at handling the officials. This has given an open field to the bureaucrats who keep them busy entangled in file work,” points out veteran political observer Jai Singh Rawat at Dehradun. The successive governments have completely failed on the development front. There are no roads, proper education, health facilities and employment avenues. Majority of the villagers in the hill districts are surviving on the money order economy with their children getting enrolled in the defence forces. The migration from the villages continues unabated. This is expected when in certain villages people have to walk no less than 20 km to 27 km for even their basic requirements. In such a scenario, a chief minister snapping at a woman employee is nothing short of insensitivity. “By showing sensitivity, he could have turned the episode to his advantage.

219,Anurag Dey,"The key question in the matter was surrounding whether Delhi is a Union Territory, with the LG being its sole administrator, or is it a special state, with the LG bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers? During the hearings, the Delhi government represented by P Chidambaram, Gopal Subhramanium and Indira Jaising, among others, argued that the LG as a titular head has superseding powers only in limited matters and cannot paralyse governance by delaying decision making. It also had contended that the LG was required to step in only in the case of an emergency. On the other hand, the Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh, argued that the Union has the supremacy so far as Delhi Legislative Assembly is concerned. He further argued that Delhi, being a Union territory, cannot be in the list of states under the Constitution and it would be undemocratic if the Legislative Assembly of Delhi has the same power as the Union of India. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has been engaged in a bitter turf battle with Baijal and his predecessor Najeeb Jung, hailed the court verdict saying it was a big victory for democracy. Among the first to congratulate Kejriwal on the court verdict was former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha, who said the judgment was a victory for the people of Delhi, for democracy and for the Constitution. The judgment can be read here:  In a massive victory for Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party ( ) over its power tussle with the Centre, the Supreme Court Wednesday unanimously held that the Lieutenant-Governor (LG) is an administrative head in limited sense; the real powers of governance of the National Capital Territory (NCT) lies with the elected representatives. In a verdict entailing huge political significance, a Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra stated that LG Anil Baijal cannot interfere in each and every decision of the  -led government. In three separate but concurring judgements, the Bench comprising Justices AK Sikri, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan, held that the LG was bound by the “aid and advice” of the Council of Minister in all areas except land, police as well as law and order. “LG is an administrative head in the limited sense, and is not a Governor. He is bound by the aid and advise of the NCT Government in areas other than those exempted”, CJI Misra said, reading out the judgment.  The apex court verdict reversed the 2016 Delhi High Court judgment, which had held that the LG was the “administrative head” of Delhi and was “not bound by the aid and advise of the Delhi Council of Ministers”. Deliberating on the significance of ‘aid and advice', the bench said “if a well-deliberated legitimate decision of the Council of Ministers is not given effect to due to an attitude to differ on the part of the LG, then the concept of collective responsibility would stand negated”. “The difference of opinion between the LG and the Council of Ministers should have a sound rationale and there should not be exposition of the phenomenon of an obstructionist,” read the judgment. Observing that the LG must work harmoniously with the government, the court stressed that he cannot mechanically refer all matters to President without application of mind. It said though, all decisions of the Government have to be communicated to the LG, there is no need to obtain his concurrence in all matters. This does not mean that the Council of Ministers is bound by the LG. There is no space for anarchy and absolutism in our Constitution, the Bench said. “The Union and the State Governments must embrace a collaborative federal architecture by displaying harmonious co-existence and interdependence so as to avoid any possible constitutional discord,” the judgment said. “A conjoint reading of clauses (3) (a) and (4) of Article 239 AA divulges that the executive power of the Government of NCT of Delhi is co-extensive with the legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly and, accordingly, the executive power of the Council of Ministers of Delhi spans over all subjects in the Concurrent List and all, but three excluded subjects, in the State List. “However, if the Parliament makes law in respect of certain subjects falling in the State List or the Concurrent List, the executive action of the State must conform to the law made by the Parliament,” the court elaborated. The CJI also specified that the NCT of Delhi does not have the status of a 'state'. The status of NCT of Delhi is sui generis, a class apart, and the status of the LG of Delhi is not that of a governor of a State, rather he remains an Administrator, in a limited sense, working with the designation of Lieutenant Governor, the court said. In his separate but concurring judgment, Justice Chandrachud held that the authority to take decisions lies with the elected government and said that a balance between the Delhi and the Central Governments was essential in view of the special status of Delhi. Justice Ashok Bhushan, in his separate but concurring judgment, said opinion of the elected government must be respected and concurrence of LG must be obtained in all matters.",2018-07-04,, Lt Guv isn't the boss.

220,Rajeev Khanna,"  Politics in Haryana is heating up for both the Lok Sabha and subsequent state assembly polls as the key players have started launching pubic outreach programmes. The opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) is presently carrying out a 'Jail Bharo Andolan' in the districts on the emotive issue of completion of Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal and water woes of the state. The party is all set to follow this programme with a campaign on another emotive issue of employment. “The 'Rozgar Mera Adhikar' movement will start once we are through with the Jail Bharo Andolan. We will be going to the youth of the state and tell them how they have been duped on employment by the state government under   (BJP) led by Manohar Lal Khattar. We will be telling the people that we do not want just registrations in the name of employment. The people should get the employment that was promised by the BJP before coming into power at both the Centre and in the state,” said INLD MP Dushyant Chautala. He has also questioned the much hyped online registration process initiated by the Haryana government saying that the process is so tedious that many people, particularly those in the rural heartland with limited knowledge of computers, find it very difficult to register themselves. “How do you expect these leaders to upload documents ?” he questioned. Armed with details gathered under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, he attacked the government for its hollow claims on employment saying that in 12 districts of the state there are 2,62,768 registered unemployed. Of these only 290 have been provided jobs by the government, which is barely 0.1 per cent of the total registered unemployed. “We had sought details from all the 22 districts but have till now managed to get details only on 12 of them. The same RTI also informs that under the much touted scheme to provide employment of 100 hours to the unemployed youth only 9948 have been provided employment for 100 hours which is only three per cent of the registered youth under the scheme,” he said. But a much more serious charge leveled by Chautala is about the Khattar government preparing ground for the complete privatisation of education in the state. Again armed with an official letter, he told media persons on Sunday that the government is bypassing constitution bodies like the employment exchanges and the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) and employing people in the schools against the 'C' and 'D' category employees through private recruitment agencies on the basis of commission per head. He claimed that all the schools, from primary to Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas will be covered under this new recruitment policy. He said the this policy has already been endorsed by the chief minister. “The companies selected for the job of recruiting will be handed over a contract for seven years and will get a commission of 2.01 per cent while the teachers will be paid a lump sum amount. My contention is that in spite of having a complete infrastructure in the form of employment exchanges and SSC, they are unable to fill the vacant posts and are instead going out for hiring to benefit a few private companies. Ironically, a large number of the private companies enlisted for carrying out this recruitment are from the home state of the Prime Minister  ,” he charged. He further said that this anti-people and anti-education policy of the government will adversely impact the right of equality of opportunity of the people to seek employment since the teachers will be recruited on the will of the recruitment agency and the authority that has the power to select it. It will also ignore the legal provisions that have made reservation a law to bring about social justice to the backward and the downtrodden. “By adopting this 'Gujarat model' of outsourcing, the government will also render the Haryana Staff Selection Commission and Employment Exchanges redundant. When you have a system in place, why do you need to hire through private players? Obviously the purpose is to give some financial benefit to some chosen private agencies,” he said while pointing that a large number of the enlisted companies are security agencies that will be enlisting 'multipurpose workers' in schools who would do everything from teaching to other petty jobs. He said that five of the empaneled companies are from Surat alone. The INLD has demanded that the government withdraw this scheme failing which it will approach the courts. “We have sent a legal notice to the concerned departments demanding that this process be scrapped failing which we will file a public interest litigation in the High Court,” Chautala said. There has been no response from the government as yet in the form of concrete facts and figures on these serious allegations leveled by the INLD. But BJP leaders have reportedly come out saying that in outsourcing of jobs in Haryana is not a new practice and was there even before the Khattar government came into power. They have also been sarcastically pointing that it is the Chautala family patriarch Om Prakash Chautala who is undergoing a prison sentence in a case pertaining to illegal recruitment of teachers. Allegations and counter allegations are all set to fly as the politicking picks up in the days to come.  ",2018-07-03,, How INLD has put Khattar govt on the mat by focusing on unemployment | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/how-inld-has-put-khattar-govt-on-the-mat-by-focusing-on-unemployment-120777.html
221,Anurag Dey,"Sushma hit back at trolls with a Twitter poll, asking users whether they ""approve such tweets”.   She also 'liked' several of the hateful tweets seeking twitterati’s response about them. Many of the trolls, some of whom followed by BJP leadership, have targeted Sushma’s personal life including her health and kidney operation she had a year ago.   Her poll got over 1,24,000 votes with a majority of them (57%) saying “No” but as much as 43 % or over 53,000 users did approve the vicious attack and abuse which itself reveals their mindset. After the poll, Sushma said she was open to criticism but not in foul language.   This is not the first time that either Modi or Shah have kept mum on an issue of significance. In fact it has been their wont to not speak on burning issues- be it the lynchings of Muslims and Dalits or the trolls celebrating the dastardly murder of Gauri Lankesh. Despite severe backlash from national and in international media Modi refused to unfollow any of the trolls who had openly expressed happiness over Lankesh’s death. With attacks on women both in the virtual and real world rising, Modi and his BJP’s stoic silence will only embolden the attackers. Expressing outrage over the vicious trolling, former Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister   asked “If our own Minister of External Affairs is not spared, what hope is there for any other woman”.  In a country where politicians are known for wielding enormous power, we have a Union minister of the stature of   who has not just fallen prey to serial online abuse and trolling by BJP supporters but has been rendered helpless by her own cabinet and party colleagues who have preferred to keep mum. It seems the BJP has left the External Affairs Minister to fend for herself. Even Swaraj's political opponents have come out in support against the vicious trolling by right-wingers, her party colleagues have maintained an eerie silence over the sexist and violent online hatred faced by Sushma. Even veterans like LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi have failed to speak up. Otherwise prolific on Twitter, Prime Minister   is yet to speak a thing on the matter while his party chief   has not found the issue big enough to merit a response. Catch News’ contacted several BJP spokespersons but failed to get a response from anyone. A senior BJP functionary claimed “ignorance” about the whole issue. BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya too refused to comment. The fact that none of the Modi government ministers deemed it prudent to come to the defence of the BJP’s senior-most woman leader, reveals a lot about the mindset of the party which takes pride in its slogan of “Beti Bachao beti Padhao”. The only comment came from Union Home Minister  , who gave a feeble reaction to a journalist saying that what happened to Swaraj was “unfortunate”. Sushma was subjected to online abuse and accused of Muslim appeasement by right wing trolls after her ministry transferred Vikas Mishra a passport official for allegedly humiliating an interfaith couple. From mocking her as “Visa Mata” to asking her husband Swaraj Kaushal to “beat her up” to “teach her not to do Muslim appeasement”, the trolls, mostly BJP supporters, poured venom on social media against Sushma for helping the interfaith couple. The constant trolling evoked an emotional response from Swaraj Kaushal who posted screenshot of a hateful tweet and said “your words have given us unbearable pain”.",2018-07-02,, BJP leaves Sushma Swaraj to fend for herself against vicious trolls | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bjp-leaves-sushma-swaraj-to-fend-for-herself-against-vicious-trolls-120607.html
222,Catch Team,"Most Kashmiris believe that the manner in which the BJP masterminded the fall of the Mehbooba Mufti-led coalition government had little to do with the situation in the Valley.  They also tend to think that the PDP was taken by surprise by the timing of the development -- Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti was holding meetings in the State Secretariat, including one with the Centre’s Interlocutor Dineshwar Sharma on 19 June morning when her fate was being decided in Delhi. Had she known what was coming, they felt, she herself would have withdrawn support to pre-empt the BJP and gained political mileage.  The local perception is that the withdrawal of support was a part of a grand strategy of the BJP with an eye on the 2019 general election. The BJP perhaps felt that by going along with the PDP, an impression was gaining ground that the party favoured secessionists and her policies were more focused on the Kashmir Valley to the detriment of Jammu and Ladakh.  The common perception was that the   government had nothing much to show case in terms of its achievements for the 2019 general election, there were no new fault lines emerging in Indian polity which could be exploited electorally – hence the fall-back option of using Kashmir to communally polarise the electorate in the state as well as the rest of India.  The Kashmiris think that the harder the slap on their face, the better the electoral fallout in the rest of India. Most are reconciled, however, to the fact that they have been reduced to a pawn in the larger politics of the BJP. The perception of the opinion makers in Kashmir to the fall of the PDP-BJP alliance government invariably brought out the following common points: 1. There was a sense of relief in the people that the BJP-PDP alliance government had come to an end. Most believed that the alliance was doomed from the beginning as the two parties had diametrically opposite ideological and political perspectives. 2. The withdrawal of support had more to do with the BJP’s calculation of how it might be able to come back to power in Delhi in the next general election in 2019 and less with the developments in Kashmir. It was linked only marginally to J&K in as much as the BJP also needed to shore up its eroding voter base in Jammu. The party feared losing both the Parliamentary seats from the region in 2019. 3. The Jammu Hindus might not be swayed by blaming all the ills of the state on the PDP and its leader Mehbooba Mufti. In the last state assembly election even those Hindu voters who normally did not vote for the BJP, voted for it because they were upset with the corruption of the Congress ministers. Having voted for the BJP, however, they find that the performance of the BJP’s ministerial team was even worse. Whether fanning communal sentiment alone can turn them in favour of the BJP remains to be seen. 4. The performance of the BJP MLAs and ministers in the government was believed by many to be below par compared to their PDP counterparts. They seem to have had little guidance from senior BJP leaders and resentment against them was growing in Jammu. It suited the party to cover their lack of performance under a communal umbrella. 5. The security situation in the Valley was the same as it was three years ago – there was violence from both sides, there was no dialogue and the Agenda of Alliance agreed upon by the PDP and BJP had become meaningless. There was also no change in the intensity and extent of the anti-insurgency operations of the security forces. The Mehbooba Mufti government never came in the way of these operations. 6. There were no drastic developments on the ground which necessitated pulling the plug on the elected government. There were better opportunities for doing so using an increase in violence and militancy as an excuse in 2016 and 2017. Some believed that had the BJP-PDP government fallen in July 2016 protests after the death of a militant leader, Burhan Wani, then the level of radicalisation in South Kashmir might have been contained. 7. The claim that the situation in Kashmir was getting out of hand should have been an admission of failure of the both partners in the. However, the BJP converted that into an excuse for imposing Governor’s Rule in the state. It dubbed the PDP as a party that favours separatists and held it solely `responsible for the deteriorating security situation in the state. 8. To make use of the Kashmir developments in the rest of India, the BJP with the help of some mainstream television media had stereotyped all Kashmiris as “Islamic” militants/terrorists or terrorist supporters. This would not only allow the party to harden its position on internal security but also polarise the voters on communal lines. It was expected that this would be done not only in Jammu but also in the rest of the country. 9. The threat of Islamic militancy/terror in J&K was also likely to be used to rationalise a harder position on Pakistan. This might result in increased heating of the Line of Control and the International Border in the state as well as some other military adventures. 10. Both the threat of terrorism in the Valley and Pakistan’s hand in promoting it would be used in the BJP’s campaign for the general election of 2019. 11. The Union government led by the BJP would now take a more belligerent position on the validity of Article 35 A of the Indian Constitution which was currently being adjudicated by the Supreme Court and scheduled for a hearing in August. The BJP government in Delhi might also give up on the ambiguity it had to maintain on Article 370 because of the compulsions of its alliance with the PDP in J&K. The Ramzan cease-fire or suspension of counter-insurgency operations announced by the Central government was unilateral, sudden and without any discussion with either the militants, separatist leaders or Pakistan. Being unilateral, only one stakeholder i.e. the security forces was brought on board (albeit reluctantly). The cease-fire was announced without any preparation, had no roadmap and its objective was unclear except to convey that the security forces would not fire unless fired upon. The operations against militants continued during the month of Ramzan. In fact, more militants (24) were killed during 30-days of unilateral cease-fire than the previous one month. Apparently, the security grid in the state was unhappy with the unilateral cease-fire declaration by the Centre but had no choice but to go along with it. Most Kashmiris that the CCG met felt that there were two positive outcomes of the cease-fire – civilian killings and incidents of stone-pelting by protestors came down drastically as there were no offensive operations. And as a result youngsters did not get in retaliatory action by the security forces. The security forces did not move out unless they had specific information about the presence of militants. This created a positive feeling among the common people. Most people in the state expected the cease-fire to be extended at least till the end of the Amarnath Yatra in end-August. No one seemed to know what prompted the government to suddenly revoke the cease-fire. The speculation was that it might have been the constant stream of bad news from Kashmir as the unilateral cease-fire had no impact on the militants. Not only did militancy continue, the recruitment to the ranks of militants increased, an army man going on leave to join his family for Eid was kidnapped and murdered and a prominent journalist assassinated in broad daylight. Local opinion speculated that under these circumstances, the extension of the cease-fire might have come at a very high cost for the BJP in the rest of the country. Besides, it was thought that the sudden unilateral announcement of the cease-fire and its abrupt revocation gave the Centre a chance to claim that it gave the militants an opportunity for moving towards peace but they failed to grasp it. This would then provide justification for continuing its hard military strategy in the state. Governor’s Rule has been imposed in the state under Article 92 of the J&K Constitution. J&K is the only state of India in which Governor’s Rule can be imposed. In all other states President’s Rule is imposed under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution. The provision in the J&K Constitution is for only six months of Governor’s Rule after which either the state legislative Assembly needs to be revived or fresh elections held. However, Governor’s Rule can be followed by the Centre imposing President’s Rule which unlike in other parts of India, does not have to be ratified within six months by Parliament. In principle, President’s Rule in J&K can be extended indefinitely without parliamentary approval. The people of Kashmir did not seem to have high expectations from the new dispensation under Governor’s Rule. They thought that the Governor could now directly follow directions from Delhi without the mediation of an elected government. They also believed that the previous placatory language of need for a dialogue with all stakeholders would now be dropped and anti-militancy operations would continue in full swing. There were some who thought that the upside of Governor’s Rule was that the state administration would be free from political influence and the governance in the state would improve. The downside, however, was that without political representation disconnect would be created between the people and the administration and their access to it would decrease.  A major challenge for the new dispensation in Srinagar would be to ensure the safety of the Amarnath Yatra or pilgrimage, which began on 28 June and will last till August 26, Rakshabandhan. Security experts claimed that the threat perception for the Amarnath Yatra was more this year than the previous years. There was some local hope and belief that Kashmiri militants would not attack the pilgrims; that they had not done so in the past either and the real threat was from Pakistan-trained terrorists. Besides, an attack on the Amarnath Yatra would require the kind of planning of which the local militants were not capable.  However, a contrary view was that given the sense of alienation and disempowerment among the local youth who have taken up arms that they might do something desperate. In view of the security threats, the state government had designated a new route for the Amarnath Yatra bypassing those inhabited areas where there could have been a possibility of attack or stone-throwing. In the last three years there were only 18 incidents of stone-pelting at the Amarnath pilgrims. However, observers pointed out that given the sense of alienation and disempowerment among local youth and their changed mind-set, spontaneous and stray stoning of the pilgrims could not be ruled out. While organised stone-pelting could in-principle be controlled, it might not be easy to deal with spontaneous action. The next big challenge under Governor’s Rule would be to ensure that civilian casualties were minimised. People expect that the offensive of the security forces would intensify now, leading to more incidents of stone-pelting which could provoke retaliation and therefore more civilian damage. Many political observers suggested that the ‘right’ optics for BJP’s Mission 2019 might actually require that not only the militants but their ‘over ground supporters’ were also seen to be dealt with severely. The new Operation All Out was not being seen as a threat to the local militants but to the Pakistani terrorists. The local militants, it was pointed out, had little training hardly any weapons and no capability to initiate any dramatic attack. The state assembly has not been dissolved but put under suspended animation. This might give the Governor an opportunity to revive the political process when the circumstances permitted such a development. The life the J&K Assembly is up to December 2020. If the assembly is neither dissolved before that date then this would allow the various political parties in the legislative assembly to attempt to form a new government before the term of the assembly got over. This could happen through new alliances being formed -- with or without breaking the existing parties. Political observers in the state believed that the Governor might test the waters for elections by first trying to hold the Panchayat elections this October and only then make up his mind whether the state was ready for fresh assembly elections. The Panchayat elections were put off in February this year because of the prevailing security situation, as was the by-election for the Aanatnag Lok Sabha seat in April, 2017. Although there has been widespread condemnation of the daylight murder of Shujaat Bukhari, the unforeseen event has sent shivers down the spine of Kashmiri intellectuals and social activists. It is widely believed that the forces behind the murder did not want a resolution of the Kashmir issue through dialogue which left out certain stakeholders or which did not take their interests into account. The group elicited the views of people across a broad cross-section of Kashmiri society and came to the conclusion that the assassination had sent multiple messages to various constituencies in Kashmir: 1. It was a signal to civil society groups and social activists that their efforts towards reconciliation and peace would not be tolerated beyond a point; that they should not aspire to become a determining influence on the resolution of the Kashmir issue. 2. It was a message to all those who questioned not only violence by the state but also by the non-state actors -- militants and terrorist infiltrators form across the border -- that they needed to choose a side. 3. It was meant to frighten the media into not crossing the red lines drawn by the separatists and their backers. This might have a chilling effect not only on the local media but also on the representatives of the jingoistic and propagandist national media in the Valley. 4. The murder was also message to the Hurriyat leaders to keep to the straight and narrow – especially to those who had begun saying that they were willing to examine the offer of a dialogue by the Centre. It seemed that the civil society was in retreat in the Kashmir Valley after the murder as people feared the silencing of non-partisan voices. Even journalists seemed apprehensive of talking of peace. The only silver lining of this visit was the communal harmony the group witnessed at the Kheer Bhawani Mela with Kashmiri Pundits, Hindus from outside the state, Sikhs and even Muslims jostling with each other in the temple complex. Kashmiri Pundits who had come in 60 buses organised by the state government claimed that no one had thrown (s)tones at them or impeded their movement. They by and large talked of fraternal and friendly treatment along the way as well as once they reached Srinagar and Ganderbal. However, the overall political and security situation in the Kashmir Valley did not show any indication of improving. While the general public was shedding no tears after the collapse of the BJP-PDP alliance, it was also not enthused by the imposition of Governor’s Rule.  There was a sense of dejection and expectation of worse to come as the discourse on Kashmir seemed to be becoming more aggressive by the day. No one expected the Modi government to take a peace initiative. People were already looking beyond the next general election due in April-May 2019 and hoping for a change in Delhi’s policies after that. Until then the people believed that harsh security measures or “danda-raj” as they called it, was likely to continue as the dominant doctrine, irrespective of who implemented it. The change of guard in Srinagar would make no difference. The political space in the Valley has shrunk and along with it the prospect of a dialogue for peace has also become distant. The most disturbing aspect of the present situation was that the Kashmiri youth was under nobody’s control. Such was the sense of disempowerment and helplessness among the youngsters that not even parental control seemed to work on those intent on joining the ranks of militants. There was glamorisation of violence among them. The youth read about the lynching of members of the minority community in the rest of India and this probably further fuelled their antipathy towards the Indian state. The overall message that seemed to have gone around was that Delhi either did not recognise the Kashmir issue as political or that even if it did, it did not want to do anything about it. This perception might become very difficult for Indian democracy to deal with, even if there were a change of guard in Delhi in May 2019.The Concerned Citizens’ Group (CCG) undertook its fifth visit to Jammu and Kashmir from 19-23 June. During this visit, the group visited the Kashmir Valley. The aim was to assess the change in the ground situation, especially peoples’ sentiments, in the wake of revocation of the unilateral cease-fire (suspension of counter-insurgency operations) by the government during the holy month of Ramzan. However, two unforeseen developments circumscribed the visit – the assassination of a prominent journalist Shujaat Bukhari, editor-in-chief of the Rising Kashmir newspaper, and the fall of the alliance government of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) and the   (BJP) when the latter withdrew its support. In fact, when the CCG members boarded their flight to Srinagar from Delhi, Chief Minister   seemed fairly well-ensconced. By the time they alighted, she had been forced to tender her resignation. The group travelled to Late Shujaat Bukhari’s village Kreeri in Baramulla district to express condolences to his family members. The visit also coincided with the Kheer Bhawani festival celebrated by Kashmiri Pundits. The group also visited the Kheer Bhawani temple at Tulmul village in Ganderbal district to meet the Hindu minority of the state, especially Kashmiri Pundits, as well as devotees from other parts of India who visit the shrine during Jyeshtha Shukla Ashtami of the Hindu calendar. The Kheer Bhawani Mela took place on 20 June this year. The CCG held interactions in Srinagar with civil society representatives, journalists and political leaders, including the outgoing chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, National Conference President Omar Abdullah, Hurriyat leaders Mirwaiz Omar Farooq and Abdul Ghani Bhat. A meeting was also held with public intellectuals and social activists from Sopore, Handwara, Kupwara, Ganderbal and Kulgam who travelled to Srinagar to meet the group. However, the entire exercise was overshadowed by the political developments leading up to the imposition of Governor’s Rule in the state and the fear instilled in civil society in the wake of Shujaat Bukhari’s brutal murder. The CCG members included Yashwant Sinha (Former Finance and External Affairs Minister), Wajahat Habibullah (First Information Commissioner of India and former Chairman of National Commission for Minorities), Air Vice-Marshal (retired) Kapil Kak, Bharat Bhushan (journalist) and Sushobha Barve (executive director, Centre for Dialogue and Reconciliation).",2018-07-02,, Whoever wins 2019 polls will have a tough job in Jammu and Kashmir | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/whoever-wins-2019-polls-will-have-a-tough-job-in-jammu-and-kashmir-120591.html
223,CK Manoj,"Bihar chief minister   has got caught in a self-woven web. An over-ambitious Kumar, who also heads the  -United (JD-U), had broken away from the erstwhile ruling Grand Alliance (GA) last year to return to the NDA in a bid to control the levers of power both in Bihar and the Centre. But his game is over. The reason behind this trouble is Kumar himself. The way he has gone about dumping alliances midway, has destroyed his credibility. No one trusts him any longer. The result is that his own allies look at him with suspicion and are hesitant to spare a “fair” number of seats to the JD-U. In the past five years, Kumar has switched sides three times, making him the most “unpredictable” politician of Indian politics. It all started in 2010 when he won the Assembly elections with the BJP's support but three years later he broke alliance with the saffron camp to form government with the Opposition. In 2014, he resigned as Chief Minister and appointed Jitan Ram Manjhi as his replacement. But less than a year later, he removed Manjhi to come back as chief minister. In 2015, he joined the three-party Grand Alliance and returned to power with the help of the RJD and the Congress but barely two years later—in July 2017—he dumped the GA to return to the BJP camp. As of now, the political scene is again agog with the news that Kumar is keen to return to the GA again. So why this eagerness for GA now? The inside story is that the BJP has refused to spare too many seats for the JD-U given its current political stature and past track record. The JD-U is demanding a lion’s share of LS seats for Bihar and also insisting on finalising the seat-sharing deal on the basis of the 2015 Assembly polls when it had won 71 seats in the 243-member Bihar Assembly against the BJP which was able to win only 53 seats. But the BJP says the basis of the seat-sharing should be the 2014 LS polls when Kumar had gone it alone, wining only two seats out of Bihar’s total 40. The NDA, on the other hand, had emerged victorious on 31 seats—the BJP alone had bagged 22 seats while Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) had won six and three seats respectively. In the last LS polls, the BJP had contested 30 seats while seven and three seats had been given to the LJP of Ram Vilas Paswan and RLSP of Upendra Kushwaha respectively. Both Paswan and Kushwaha have refused to spare their allotted seats for the JD-U though the BJP has showed its willingness to leave five of the 30 it had contested last time for Kumar’s party. Given this situation, the JD-U could get a maximum of five seats to contest under the seat-sharing arrangement. It’s this apprehension of getting less number of seats which has caused panic in the JD-U camp, prompting it to use various pressure tactics to make a hard bargain. Another reason being widely stated is that the BJP too is suspicious of Kumar’s activities and doesn’t trust him anymore. “The issue is not about sparing seats for Nitish Kumar. The real issue is that no one is sure how long he will stay with the NDA. In that case, the seats allotted to JD-U will turn useless,” said a BJP leader seeking anonymity. Apparently, it was under in this context that the chief minister called up ailing RJD chief Lalu Prasad last week. Prasad is now recuperating in a Mumbai hospital. The idea, as such, was to put pressure on the BJP in a bid to gain maximum number of LS seats for Bihar but the RJD sought to spoil this plan by displaying a “No Entry” board for Kumar in the GA. The RJD which enjoys the massive support Muslims and Yadavs, faces the risk of losing its own votes in the event of the chief minister returning to the GA again. In the last one year since Kumar ditched the GA, the RJD has launched an intense agitation against Kumar across the state, charging the latter with “misusing the people’s mandate”. Its impact was tremendous. Bihar Opposition leader  , Lalu’s “political heir”, was greeted with a huge crowd wherever he led the protest. So if the RJD welcomes Kumar into GA, it is likely to boomerang. Given that it has no option, the JD-U would be compelled to stay in the NDA. By making frequent somersaults, Kumar has spoiled his own case. As his last attempt, Kumar has announced that the JD-U will be contesting the upcoming elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on its own. But this is unlikely to change the BJP’s stand. The BJP is aware of the fact that the JD-U doesn’t have a presence anywhere except Bihar. Recently, the JD-U had contested elections in Gujarat and Karnataka but most of its candidates forfeited their security deposits. Even in Bihar, Kumar's popularity has suffered and he has survived mainly with the support of his allies. Past records indicate that Kumar has suffered serious setbacks whenever he chose to go it alone. This was proven first in the 1995 Assembly polls when the Kumar-led Samata Party was able to win only seven seats in the 324-member assembly in undivided Bihar. Again in 2014 LS polls, Kumar decided to go it alone but ended up winning only two out of 40 seats his party had contested. Kumar is, thus, short of options.",2018-07-05,, How Nitish Kumar has been caught in a web of his own making | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/how-nitish-kumar-has-been-caught-in-a-web-of-his-own-making-121118.html
225,Atul Chandra,"The Uttar Pradesh Law Commission has submitted a draft bill on prevention of cow slaughter to the state government. It has several key recommendations such as: *No arrests should be made on mere suspicion that a person is in possession of beef or has slaughtered a cow or its progeny until lab tests prove the seized meat to be beef. *Starving a cow and its progeny after it ceases to be of use, would come under the definition of slaughter. *Consumption of imported beef in sealed containers is allowed. The need for a new legislation was felt because in the view of Law Commission Chairman, Justice AN Mittal, a few amendments in the present Act won’t serve the purpose. “There are too many grey areas in the present Act which make the protection of cow and its progeny difficult. Therefore, I have proposed that it should be repealed,” Justice Mittal said. An important recommendation made in the draft proposal was with regard to arrests made on mere suspicion of the presence of beef in any seizure. “It has been realised that in the absence of sufficient laboratories for differentiation of beef from that of the meat of other species of animals also causes bonafide difficulties to the meat sellers,” he said. In the proposed legislation a provision was being made that whenever any meat or suspected body part is recovered then it should be sent to public laboratories and any action against the person from whom a seizure is made should be taken only after a lab “authenticates that the meat or body part recovered belongs to cow or its progeny.” It is doubtful if lynch mobs would wait for a lab report before killing a person as had happened in the case of Akhlaq in Dadri in 2015. To address the confusion over use of the term ‘beef’ even for buffalo meat, Justice Mittal felt the definition required change. In the existing Act, the words ‘beef’, ‘cow’, ‘goshala’, ‘institution’, ‘slaughter’ have been defined. In the definition of cow, heifer, or calf, bull, bullock, disabled, diseased and barren cow were being included to make it more exhaustive. As per the present definition of beef there are restrictions only on sale or transport of beef. The proposed legislation has now brought “possession, store, purchase and transport of beef and its body parts” under the ambit of law. In the opinion of law panel the body parts of a cow and its progeny ---like hide, bones and horns--- are also traded and must constitute an illegal act. An important exception has been made for keeping imported beef in sealed containers. It is the wider definition of ‘slaughter’ which is significant in the draft legislation. Justice Mittal has proposed that it should include not only “maiming and inflicting of physical injury to cause death of the cow and its progeny” but also forced starvation of the animal by its owners, irrespective of the community to which they belong. Citing a common practice among cattle owners in this regard, the draft legislation states that whenever any cow becomes barren or calves become “unuseful after attaining 2-3 years of age” the owners tie their mouths and set them free. Besides being barren, these animals may be diseased or disabled. Because their mouths are tightened with a string or a net, such cows and calves cannot graze and eventually starve to death. “Therefore, the words ‘doing any act with the intention of causing unnatural death’ should also be included in the definition of slaughter,” Justice Mittal proposed. Allowing a cow, along with its heifer, to roam the streets blocking traffic and eating garbage and plastic material which are potentially life threatening has also been made a cognisable offence. The proposed punishment for “causing trauma, pain or suffering” is three years in jail and a fine. Taking note of attacks on those in the business of disposing the carcass of a cow dying a natural death the proposed Bill recommends adequate safeguards “to maintain communal harmony and peace.” While under the present Act it is an offence to skin a cow dying of natural causes, the proposed bill has recommended that the “work shall be performed by the authorised contractor and such contractor shall obtain authorisation from the competent authority”. As per the proposed law, a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) will be the competent authority for such cases and also for those dealing with transportation of cow and its progeny, which is another “grey area” in the present Act. “The present Act,” Justice Mittal said, “does not contain any provision on preventing the transportation of cow and its progeny for the purpose of slaughter from one district to another within the state and the only offence is for transportation to any place outside the state.” The law panel proposal says that “in the name of cattle fair and other purposes, the cow and its progeny are being transported from different parts of Uttar Pradesh” to districts bordering other states facilitating export to neighbouring states. It also notes that the slaughter of cows is much more in areas adjacent to Nepal, Bihar and Haryana than in other districts. This deduction is based on pending cases of cow slaughter in the state. To plug the loophole the proposed law provides that if any transporter wants to ferry cow and its progeny to a cattle fair, for agricultural purposes or dairy farming within or outside the state, “such persons shall be required to take transit permit from the divisional commissioner for inter-state transportation and an SDM for within the state movement.” If refused, “the applicant may prefer appeal to the divisional commissioner or may also submit revision before the Sessions Court”. The proposed legislation prohibits export of cows to states and areas where cow slaughter is permitted. Due to lacunae in the present Act smugglers and transporters of cattle have managed escape the law which now proposes punishment for the confiscation of the vehicle, the owner of the vehicle and also the clerk booking the consignment. The seizure of vehicle “will be subject to the discretion of the competent authority”. At present no punishment is prescribed for these persons. The law panel has provided numbers to prove that the existing Act has failed to prevent cow slaughter. At present there are 32,542 pending cases of cow slaughter in the state in which 52,159 persons are involved, it says in a separate chapter. During the last five years verdicts in 1125 cases have resulted in the conviction of 2022 accused. Highest pendency of 33,000 cases was in districts like Gorakhpur, Bahraich, Lakhimpur, Shahjahanpur, Chandauli, Rampur, Bareilly, Meerut and Badaun. Enhancing the punishment for cow slaughter, the new bill has proposed a maximum sentence of 10 years and a minimum of two years’ imprisonment along with a minimum fine of Rs 20,000 which may go up to Rs 1 lakh.  ",2018-07-05,, UP Law Commission wants to remove grey areas on cow slaughter.

226,Charu Kartikeya,"  There is a critical irony in the Supreme Court’s judgment in the case over the power struggle between the elected government of Delhi and the Lieutenant Governor. While the judgment is focused on a pragmatic interpretation of Constitutional provisions that govern Delhi’s administration, it, ironically, deals with the dispute only at theoretical levels. While the ruling will settle many issues in the power struggle between the two constitutional authorities, the dust in the capital is not likely to entirely settle down, as of now. There are many contentious issues that the judgment has not touched upon. Delhi’s LG’s, of late, must have started thinking of themselves as some kind of imperial lords of the capital, as reflected in the conduct of the incumbent, Anil Baijal, and his predecessor, Najeeb Jung. They would lock horns with the elected government over decision after decision and proposal after proposal. The significance of the ruling by the five-judge bench lies in the fact that it has unambiguously highlighted that the Delhi LG must never think of himself as some kind of an overlord of the territory. The LG must abide by the spirit of the Constitution, which entails him to “respect” the elected government and not adopt an obstructionist attitude towards it. Look at the court’s pronouncements to understand this - Significantly, the judgment has also ensured that the elected government must not misuse these assertions to completely bypass the office of the LG. The bench said unambiguously, that - The elected representatives must display constitutional objectivity as a standard of representative governance which neither tolerates ideological fragmentation nor encourages any utopian fantasy, rather it lays stress on constitutional ideologies. The Lieutenant Governor, being the Administrative head, shall be kept informed with respect to all the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers. Under the Transaction of Business Rules, the Lieutenant Governor must be kept duly apprised on all matters pertaining to the administration of the affairs of the NCT. The Rules indicate the duty of the Council of Ministers to inform the Lieutenant Governor right from the stage of a proposal before it. However, what has remained a grey area even after the ruling is with respect to which areas is the elected government free to take its decisions and merely keep the LG in the loop. Is the chief minister, for example, free to decide on postings of top bureaucrats in the capital, requiring to merely inform the LG? Or, is the health minister free to open as many poly-clinics as the council of ministers approves of and merely let the LG know? Or, is the home minister free to purchase CCTVs and get them installed all over the capital without seeking the concurrence of the union government through the LG? Or, is the CM free to implement home delivery of key government certificates and services without seeking the LG’s nod? These and many more similar questions remain unanswered even after today’s ruling. Even the ruling admitted this shortcoming when it said that “it may not be possible to make an exhaustive catalogue of those differences which may be referred to the President by the Lieutenant Governor”. Having said that, it must be added that these grey areas must not be allowed to overshadow the gravity of the landmark ruling. Political parties are prone to misuse the office of the LG when they are in power at the Centre. What this ruling has done is to say it out clearly that even while the Centre, through the LG, does have powers over the capital’s administration, there is a line of decorum that must never be crossed. The problem is that in adversarial politics, no lines except those clearly drawn are recognised.  ",2018-07-04,, Delhi LG vs CM case: SC ruling’s biggest irony lies in its stress over pragmatism | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/delhi-lg-vs-cm-case-sc-ruling-s-biggest-irony-lies-in-its-stress-over-pragmatism-120970.html
227,Rajeev Khanna,"   (BJP) has got down to the exercise of regaining its lost political ground in the all important state of Gujarat and the successful 'poaching' of senior Congress leader Kunwarji Bavaliya is the first important achievement in this direction. Bavaliya dumping the Congress to join the BJP is a strategic move by the latter in terms of region and caste politics in the state ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls which is the home turf of both the Prime Minister   and BJP's national president  . The development was predictable following the series of events that had been taking place over the last few months. It was swift political action on Tuesday over a few hours that saw Bavaliya resigning from the Congress and as Jasdan MLA, driving to the BJP office for being inducted into the saffron party and thereafter being administered oath as a member of Chief Minister' Vijay Rupani's team of ministers. Through his poaching the BJP would be looking at three major things. The first is to have a credible leader in the all important Saurashtra region. The second to make inroads into the Other Backward Castes (OBC) voter support base while balancing caste equations within the party and third making up for losses in the rural areas. These factors need to be analyzed one by one. The BJP had witnessed a major rout in the Saurashtra region in the 2017 Assembly polls. This region sends 58 of the 182 members of the state assembly. The BJP's tally had come down considerably from 35 to 23 in the recent polls and the party had been routed in the rural areas on issues due to farmers' unrest and the voters' caste combination that voted against the party. “Bavaliya is one of the most experienced political faces from Saurashtra. A four time MLA and one time MP, he comes from the all important Koli community among the OBCs. The OBCs account for more than 45 per cent of the total electorate. The Kolis that are referred to Thakors in other parts of Gujarat account for roughly half the total OBC population. This surely makes him a prize catch,” said a political observer. He further pointed that the Koli community lacks in education and is known to vote for candidates on their community irrespective of the party he is representing. “Bavaliya's reputation is also good among the people. A teacher who is polite and easily accessible with total connect with the ground realities makes him popular in the rural areas,” he said. Another interesting fact is that by inducting Bavaliya, the BJP leadership can now deal more effectively with its other Koli strongman Parshottam Solanki along with his brother Hira Solanki. Parshottam has been throwing tantrums seeking elevation from a minister of state to cabinet rank. Despite being assured that his concerns would be addressed he is known to remain absent from important meetings. Hira had recently lost the assembly poll from Rajula seat but his representing the powerful Koli community ensured that he was inducted in the poll management committee of the BJP for the Lok Sabha elections.. With Bavaliya expected to take a centrestage among the Koli community, the Solanki brothers would not be able to throw their weight around like before. But many are skeptical whether Bavaliya would be able to give electoral dividends to the BJP in the coming polls. Sources say that many of his supporters were not keen on his joining the BJP at this point of time and had instead wanted him to bargain for a better deal within the Congress. These supporters are of the view that the Congress leaders who had joined the BJP in the past have got a raw deal. They say that heavyweights like Narhari Amin have gone into oblivion and those who were given tickets lost the polls. They have also pointed that the anger against the BJP still persists in rural Saurashtra. It needs to be pointed that the build up for Bavaliya's departure from the Congress was underway for the last several months. He was initially peeved at not being made the leader of the Opposition and the party president   choosing the much younger Paresh Dhanani for the post. He was also sidelined for the post of the state Congress chief that eventually went to Amit Chavda. His rivalry with Indranil Rajyaguru, the Congress leader from Rajkot had also been making headlines. Rajyaguru too tendered his resignation from the party last week which is yet to be accepted. An agitated Bavaliya had met Rahul Gandhi some days back. Sources say that he was offered a greater role in the organisation at the central level which was not acceptable to him. He had come back and had held a meeting with his supporters at Jasdan where the latter asked him to 'think differently'. Observers say that the BJP will intensify its moves to get more disgruntled Congress leaders on board ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. It had won all the 26 parliamentary seats in the state in 2014. he Congress came up with a spirited performance in the recent assembly polls. The question now is whether the grand old party will manage to keep its flock together. If yes, then what has it got to offer to its disgruntled leaders. A visit by Rahul Gandhi is on the cards soon. It remains to be seen what he has in mind to stem the slide.  ",2018-07-04,, BJP poaches Congress' Bavaliya in Gujarat to make inroads among OBCs and rural Saurashtra | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bjp-poaches-congress-bavaliya-in-gujarat-to-make-inroads-among-obcs-and-rural-saurashtra-120969.html
228,Sulagna Sengupta,"  With the Central Bureau of Investigation becoming pro-active against All India Trinamool Congress leaders in the Saradha and Narada scams, the West Bengal CID is turning the heat on BJP leaders. On Thursday, CID initiated a fresh murder case related to the violence in Nandigram in 2007 and 2008. An FIR has been lodged against CPI(M)-turned-BJP leader Lakshman Seth and 15 others. Seth joined the BJP in 2016. In a statement, the West Bengal CID said, “We have taken up the investigation of the Nandigram police station case number 71/18 registered on March 2, 2018 over the abduction and murder of Durgapada Maity and Subrata Samanta in 2007. An FIR has been lodged against 15 people along with Lakshman Seth"". Sources in state CID said that family members of two victims approached a local court seeking re-investigation in the missing cases. The court has directed the state CID to register murder cases. In 2007, the then Left Front government decided to allow Salim Group to set up a chemical hub at Nandigram under the special economic zone policy. This led to resistance by villagers resulting in clashes with the police that left 14 villagers dead. It is said that alleged CPI(M) goons led by Lakshman Seth also targetted the protestors. Cases involving the murder and abduction of people in Nandigram as well as the cases pertaining to police firing were handed over to the CBI after the first bout of violence in 2007. CBI filed multiple charge-sheets and arrested a few CPI(M) workers. The CBI has approached the West Bengal government on December 2012, seeking the state’s approval to prosecute five police officers, one doctor and six accused for the police firing that killed 14 people in Nandigram. The state government refused to grant permission to prosecute the accused and the family members of the victim moved to Calcutta High Court challenging the CBI probe. After a while the West Bengal government asked CBI to hand over the documents pertaining to the investigation and asked state CID to look into the matter. The state government also asked CBI why it failed to prosecute top police officers and sought permission to prosecute only middle level police officers. The CBI is yet to respond to the West Bengal government's queries. But this is not the only case involving BJP leaders that the CID is looking into. Last week West Bengal DGP Virendra presided over a meeting at Bhawani Bhawan, the state CID headquarters, which was attended by top CID officials. He is said to have taken stock of the progress in various cases against BJP leaders. BJP MP Roopa Ganguly is facing an investigation in a child-trafficking case in Jalpaiguri, BJP leader Shamik Bhattacharya was summoned by state CID on 25 July, 2017 in connection with a fraud case. A complaint against Bhattacharya was lodged in Basirhat police station by some locals who alleged that money was taken from villagers in the name of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY), assuring them of houses. On 6 August, 2017 the state CID summoned BJP leader Lakshman Seth at Bhawani Bhawan over a fraud case to the tune of several crores. Seth has been booked under sections 420 (fraud), 409 (criminal breach of trust) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. It was alleged that his non-profit organisation Indian Centre for Advancement of Research and Education (ICARE) which runs and maintains educational institutions has bungled crores of rupees. During 2010-11 Seth was the chairman of I-CARE. Explaining his party's stand, West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said “We do not support corruption. If any BJP leaders are involved in corruption, he /she should be punished. But Trinamool Congress is playing politics over these cases. Why did the state CID reopen the murder case 10 years after the Nandigram violence? We are not frightened by any agency investigation.” On 20 June, CBI special director Rakesh Asthana came to Kolkata and expressed displeasure over the way the Narada investigation has been carried out in Bengal. He also pulled up the investigating officer Ranjit Kumar for not forwarding all the essential reports to the CBI headquarters in Delhi. Soon after Asthana's visit, a DIG rank officer Abhay Singh was transferred to Ranchi. Singh was supervising the Narada and Saradha cases in Bengal. Sources in the CBI said that Asthana had urged investigating officers to complete the investigation into the Narada Rose Valley and Saradha ponzi scam this year and instructed them to file the final chargesheet as early as possible. He also assured that more officers from Delhi CBI will be deputed to complete the investigation process. State parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said “ The state CID is doing its job. There is no politics involved in the investigation that is being carried out by the CID.”  ",2018-07-05,, CID initiates murder case related to Nandigram violence against BJP's Lakshman Seth | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/cid-initiates-murder-case-related-to-nandigram-violence-against-bjp-s-lakshman-seth-121123.html
229,Sudarshana Chakraborty,"The domestic workers’ rights movement brings together three different movements – the women’s right movement, social security movement and the unorganised sector workers’ movement. PGPS is among several such organisations of domestic workers in West Bengal under the umbrella of Griha Shramik Adhikar Abhiyan. The domestic workers placed 13 demands to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the state labour minister as well as some lawmakers so that those can be discussed at the Monsoon Session of the State Assembly. The demands include: The domestic workers of the city have two more demands: the constitution of a domestic workers’ welfare board and a creche for their children. “A few of us from the organisation regularly met government officials since 2014,” Tahmina Begum, a PGPS member, said. “We submitted all information and papers they sought and have now achieved this 'trade union' status. It will be good if other organisations try. That will increase our strength.” she added. PGPS has members from seven districts: North and South 24 Paraganas, Kolkata, Howrah, Asansol, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling. The recognition of PGPS as Trade Union is a step forward to the recognition of domestic workers as labourers in Bengal. States like Bihar, Jharkhand, Odhisa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and Rajasthan already have laws fixing minimum wages for domestic workers; Kerala, Maharastra and TamilNadu have welfare boards for them; India has more than 25 lakh domestic workers, 57 per cent of them are women, according to data from the National Sample Survey (2009-10). The country does not follow regulations framed by International Labour Organization for domestic workers. This workforce is not included in social security schemes. The Centre drafted a policy, but it is yet to be legislated.  “We are happy about PGPS becoming a trade union. Now we have to push for a welfare board, a minimum wage of Rs 54 per hour and a comprehensive legislation for domestic workers,” Anibrata Pramanik, an activist involved with Griha Shramik Adhikar Abhiyan, said. A domestic worker pointed out that being recognised as a union equals to being recognised as workers and help in bargaining collectively with employers. At a day-to-day level, she hoped she and her colleagues would no longer need to have her tea in broken tumblers, no more be fed stale and leftover food, not be accused of theft or humiliated otherwise, not have to face misbehaviour by employers, and would be able to work in an atmosphere free from sexual abuse. “Our biggest demand is the minimum wage, which we are yet to achieve in our state. Also a welfare board is necessary for the wholesome development of our community. In our State Committee meeting we have discussed issues like – why it is humiliating to submit our identity cards at police station before getting a job and how to deal with the issue, written contracts, creches for our children etc. We hope, now we’ll be working towards these issues in a more focused manner,” added Mishtri, who has been working as a domestic worker since her adolescent days. Now she works in a single household and her employers are encouraging about her activism. Most employers were supportive of the move, Tahmina said. Pointing out that there were various types of employers, Tapashi Moira, former secretary of PGPS, said: “Those who were good to us will remain so.” Many present at the rally said their employers knew about their activism and did not dissuade them. There were doubting Thomases too. “One employer told me that going to the rally would be pointless as we would achieve nothing. I told her to keep watching TV. I could finish my work and still participate. After all, I am fighting for my right,” a worker said. PGPS and other organisations are now concentrating to broaden the spectrum, visiting new areas and engaging with more workers. Workers are now seeking written contracts with employers. Senior trade unions leaders welcomed the move cautiously: “This is good news. Domestic workers form an important section of the unorganised sector. Their demands regarding minimum wage, welfare board, and leaves must be met and they should be treated as labourers,” Tapan Sen, general secretary of CITU in West Bengal, said. “Now that they are getting the status of a trade union, they should work in collaboration with other unions,” he added. “I welcome the decision. But we have to keep in mind that achieving the status does not mean misusing the power and disturbing the social structure. Domestic workers have to keep in mind that this status comes with a responsibility,” Pradip Bhattacharya, a member of the National Committee of INTUC, said. He sought the formation of a commission to look into the demands raised by domestic workers and their rights and place them before the government. “Rights of unorganised sector workers and their movement have to be dealt with cautiously,” he added. Chandrarekha Pandey, co-ordinator of domestic workers at All-India Unorganised Workers Congress, said: “This is an achievement. It will give domestic workers the status of laborers. I don’t think it’ll have any negative effect on their relation with employers as it will be more transparent now.” “This status of trade union will make our organisation stronger, but this is only a first step. We have not achieved all. Our employers are not one but many,” PGPS Secretary Anita Mishtri said. The domestic workers and activists pointed out that they were aware of their responsibilities and that being a Trade Union will help them to fight any irregularity if there is any among themselves too. In India there is no legal framework as of now regarding the rights of domestic workers. In this scenario as PGPS is granted the status of a Trade Union this definitely marks a sign of change in the rights movement of the unorganised sector workers.Taking a day off is not easy for Aloka Naiya, Sabita Sau, Sabitri Mistri and many doemstic workers like them – entire households go off gear without them. So, in a way it was a big deal when they took leave to attend a rally. On 16 June, on International Domestic Workers' Day, more then 2,000 such workers hit the streets of Kolkata to celebrate the West Bengal government's recognition to Paschimbanga Griha Paricharika Samity (PGPS) as a trade union. That's a first for the state which has a history of trade union movements. Those gathered expressed their enthusiasm with slogans like ' ' (Can't do without us) and ' ' (We, the gang of girls united / Would now bring about change). Curious onlookers collected leaflets as they watched the rally.  “The recognition will make us stronger, help us get better pay and make our job secure,” Naiya said.",2018-07-05,, Domestic workers of West Bengal find new hope in trade union | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/life-society-news/domestic-workers-of-west-bengal-find-new-hope-in-trade-union-121114.html
230,Mandira Bhattacharya,"The most recurrent question that is raised is on the issue of language and script. Did the language and the script of Indus Valley have any link with the Vedic people or the language spoken by them? Scholars of linguistics, of ancient languages, archaeo-linguistics, and of course archaeologists continued hair-splitting discussions on its antiquity and legacy.  Some over-enthusiastic nationalists such as Tilak ( , Bal Gangadhar Tilak, 1903, Pune) tried to identify it as belonging to the Vedic Aryans and asserted that the Aryans had migrated to India. But the discovery of the Harappan sites by Marshall led him to the most plausible origin and linking it with the Dravidian speaking Brahuis living in and around West Pakistan. A Dravidian origin of the script has been the most agreed upon formula by scholars like Asko Parpola, Iravatham Mahadevan and many others. But to arrive at a conclusive inference, we still await the discovery of a Rosetta stone with the Indus script. The Vedas came from the   (what is heard) and   (memory) tradition, an oral tradition strictly preserved within a group of people -- the Brahmanas. The early Vedic people did not practice writing, which is a necessary condition for a civilisation to be called urban. Writing, as such, appeared much later in India with the Buddhist king Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. The Vedas were put in writing even much later in the 15th century. Where did the Aryans live or where did they come from is a question that has been much debated. The moment a similarity was established between the European and the Vedic languages, history took many interesting turns. Gordon Childe in 1926 published his book,  , which was used by the Nazis to argue about purity of race and justifying the holocaust on the basis of it and making it difficult for Childe to even mention it. This did not dissuade the scholarly world. The hypotheses that all the Indo-European languages were spoken in a restricted area, somewhere in the Eurasian Steppes or somewhere in Caucasus has not yet been resolved with any amount of certainty. Not much archaeological evidence in favour of the Rig Vedic people is available. The excavation at Hastinapur in 1950-52 by BB Lal had established the stratigraphy with Ochre Coloured Pottery (OCP) at the bottom followed by the Painted Grey Ware (PGW) and finally the Northern Black Polished Ware. This established the fact that each layer indicated a settlement of a different group of Indo-Aryan people coming to this region at different points of time with different levels of technological expertise. The last has been connected with the advent of iron in the sub-continent. The date of the use of iron has been fixed to the 1000 BCE. The migration of the Indo-Europeans to the Indian sub-continent was not a single event. They came in batches over a period of time. Archaeological evidence of the OCP and the copper horde associated cultures -- the PGW people in the fertile plains of the Doab, Gandhara grave cultures from modern day Swat, Pakistan and Afghanistan in the north, along with the Cemetery H culture from Harappa, were probably the settlements of the early Indo-European immigrants. Since 1822, hordes of copper implements have been discovered from the Ganga-Yamuna valley. Most of these were chance discoveries. In the early 1950s, several sites in the Ganga-Yamuna valley yielded copper objects of similar nature. They were discovered along with pottery, now called OCP (Allchins,  , 1968, page 200). Many of these hordes contained the Anthropomorphic figure and the Antennae Sword. But the latest discovery of the three 'chariots' along with a copper horde by the ASI at Sinauli village of Baghpat district in Uttar Pradesh has not been reported earlier. The date according to the excavators (2000-1800 BCE) coincides with the dispersal theory. This find at Rakhigarhi seems to have ignited the sort of 'Diseased nationalism' as famously pointed out by Grahame Clark while condemning the use of archaeology in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy (Archaeology and Society, 1939) among a certain section of the political class today. Rewriting history is central to a nationalist project. Eric Hobsbawm rightly pointed out that “History is to Nationalism, what poppy is to an opium addict!” The conclusion drawn by some and promoted by others that this find establishes that ‘Aryans’ were inhabitants of the urban Indus civilisation, is seriously far-fetched. The DNA report of the skeletons discovered at this site needs to be carefully examined to arrive at any conclusive inference. A find such as this does not alone change the archaeological map created by years of toil and sacrifice. Rakhigarhi is a huge site, it has been only partially excavated. The reports have to be scientifically validated to shift dramatically from the existing theories. But till then, we who rely on rationality and scientific evidence, shall stand by the historically established theory of Bronze Age horse-tamers, with chariots arriving in the subcontinent continuously for a period, probably from Iran; probably with links to the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex located in present-day northern Afghanistan, eastern Turkmenistan, southern Uzbekistan and western Tajikistan, centred on the upper Amu Darya — but surely in the decaying years of the Harappan civilization.It is almost a hundred years since the discovery of the Indus Valley Civilisation by RD Banerji and others like MS Vats, D Ram Sahni and John Marshall, the then Director of Archaeology. But since then with continuing discoveries of newer sites, the inferences about the nature of the civilisation has changed over time. People continue to speculate about its origin, its spread, its uniqueness. Who were these people that built such complex urban centres? Did they speak a language that is similar to any group of the present day languages? Does the script have a following among the present day scripts? These continue to be much debated questions. The early assumption of the Indus sites being discontinuous with some being pre-Harappan and other being part of it, was changed to an understanding of a continuous civilisation which may be divided into Early, Mature and Late Harappan periods. This was arrived because of the linkages found in the different sites in different periods and thus the ' ' (the one who is created by oneself) character of the civilisation as was stated by early historians was settled. The Indus urban centres, after a full mature phase, show multiple symptoms of decay. The municipal system was falling apart. The drains were covering the roads. The planning had deteriorated into an asystematic affair. Trade too declined. The evidence from Sumer was no longer available.  In the last phase of the Indus civilisation, archaeologists have discovered new elements in the many artefacts excavated, and called this post-urban phase the Jhukar culture or the Cemetery H culture, which is distinct from the earlier phases of Indus civilisation.  It was a time of decay of the urban centres. The Indus people probably dispersed beyond. This dispersal took two lines of advance, one passing to the north of the Rajasthan desert and the other to the south. In the south, there were suggestions of several distinct waves of new settlements ( , BC Bridget and Raymond Allchin, 1968).  The imaginative idea that the Vedic people lived or created the Indus valley civilisation is difficult to establish, given that all historical evidence indicates that the Vedic people were mostly pastoralists. They did not know agriculture; even most of the terms in the Vedas used for cultivation are non-Sanskritic in origin, and are words of Dravidian and Munda origin.  The landscape of the Rig Vedic world was very different from the urban centres of the Indus Valley. Though both the early Vedic and the Indus Valley Civilisations were Bronze-centric, they cannot be said to be linked to each other based on this mere fact.",2018-07-06,," Chariots and ancient DNA are fine, but history of India has to be about rationality | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/culture-news/chariots-and-ancient-dna-are-fine-but-history-of-india-has-to-be-about-rationality-121256.html
231,Ashwin Aghor,"Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh president Prakash Ambedkar is on a warpath against the BJP government. He has accused the saffron party of implicating innocent people for the violence that took place at Bhima Koregaon in January this year as well as the alleged plot to assassinate Prime Minister  . “The BJP leadership has realised that it is in for a miserable defeat in the coming general elections. And in a frantic effort to salvage the situation, the government is trying to curb the voices rising against it. The police action, in the name of the violence after the Elgar Parishad at Pune in January this year, is a perfect example. The government plans to provoke nationwide violence by implicating innocent people in false police cases so that an emergency-like crisis arises,” Ambedkar alleged. He claimed that the Elgar Parishad organised at Pune on 31 December last year was against the divisive Brahminical system given by Manu. The Parishad evoked an unprecedented response from the Dalit community. Baffled by the huge response, the central agencies, which are under control of the Brahminical system, cracked down on the organisers of Elgar Parishad by linking it to the violence that broke on 1 January this year. “The police has no concrete evidence to prove their theory. They have a few letters and e-mails in the name of so-called clinching evidence, which will not stand in the court or law since they have interpreted the information as per their wish,” he said. Ambedkar claimed that the police have not established that the e-mails in question were sent by the accused and the authenticity of the letter is also under question. “There is no evidence to establish that the documents were recovered from the computers of the accused. Moreover, the police have also failed to provide evidence such as the IP address (of the computer from which the mail was sent) as well as the date and time,” he said. He also said that many retired police officials have dismissed the “evidence” provided by the Pune police.    “My name appears in one of the letters and there is mention of one Comrade Prakash in the other letter, which also has a discussion on the alleged plan to assassinate PM Modi. Both these letters are very crucial. It is a huge mystery, how they made their way to the media. Incidentally, DGP Satish Mathur claimed that the letters were not issued by police but leaked by Maoists and Joint CP, Pune Ravindra Kadam clarified that Comrade Prakash was not me,” Ambedkar said. He also claimed that Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote planned the riots at Bhima Koregaon following the Elgar Parishad, but instead of punishing them, the government was acting against the organisers of the Elgar Parishad. “The police action is being done with a political motive. The government wants to divide society in the name of caste and class. There are systematic efforts to create a divide between the supporters of reservation and those who oppose it. Earlier, some anti-social elements tried to fuel a rift between Maratha and Dalit communities. Later they tried to provoke Hindu-Muslim riots. But they have failed to achieve what they wanted,” Ambedkar said. “If there is really threat to the life of PM, then the security agencies handled the matter in the most immature way,” he added. “The police have no courage to arrest Sambhaji Bhide because he is the guru of PM Modi and CM Devendra Fadnavis. They are implicating innocent people in the crime just to cover up their incompetence,” Ambedkar said. In a series of raids, Pune police had arrested activists Rona Wilson and Rana Jacob from New Delhi, Sudhir Dhavale of Elgar Parishad from Mumbai and activist Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut and Advocate Surendra Gadling from Nagpur on 6 June. One of the letters was allegedly recovered from computers belonging to Wilson. Ambedkar and several other Dalit and Left outfits have accused the BJP of trying to delegitimise the struggle of Dalits. The BJP, which had earlier gone hammer and tongs on the issue, has now suddenly gone silent. “We don't comment on court matters. Court will decide whether they are Maoists or not,” said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra.",2018-06-13,," 'Fearing defeat, BJP is trying to implicate innocent people': Prakash Ambedkar | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/fearing-defeat-bjp-is-trying-to-suppress-voices-by-implicatin-innocent-people-prakash-ambedkar-117817.html
232,Rajeev Khanna,"It has been six months that the Congress got a drubbing at the hands of the   (BJP) in the hill state of Himachal Pradesh. Just when the things have started warming up for the Lok Sabha elections due next year, Congress leaders in the state seem to have taken no lesson from their humiliating defeat as they continue bickering instead of making efforts to put their act together. This phenomenon was on a grand display when the newly appointed All-India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge Rajni Patil came calling for her first visit to the state. Former chief minister Virbhadra Singh and his loyalists decided to stay away from the first meeting addressed by Patil on 11 June. The writing was clear on the wall for Patil: Managing the state Congress is not going to be an easy task, particularly when there are just a few months left for the Lok Sabha polls and the stakes are very high. She called on former state party chief Vidya Stokes at her residence. This was followed by a meeting with Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) office bearers, inclusing current state chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu and former chief Kaul Singh Thakur. Those absent included Virbhadra, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Mukesh Agnihotri, AICC secretary Asha Kumari, Rajinder Rana and Vinay Kumar. Even Virbhadra’s son Vikramaditya did not attend the meeting: He was reportedly away in Sikkim along another first-time legislator Ashish Butail. On Tuesday Patil was compelled to admit before the media that factionalism is rife in the Grand Old Party and the party leaders need to put their egos aside and come together for a good performance in the Lok Sabha polls. She expressed hope that the differences between the leaders would be sorted out and they would come on a common platform to come up with a winning performance in 2019 polls. Virbhadra reportedly continues to be miffed over Sukhu continuing as the state president of the party and wants the reins to be handed over to one of his loyalists. Observers feel that he is back to his blackmailing ways. Sources within the party say that although a change of guard in the organisation is imminent but it remains to be seen when the party high command decides to appoint a new president for the state. The high command is busy preparing for the electoral battles in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan besides trying to stitch an alliance for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. But a party insider said: “The sooner Congress president appoints a new organisational leadership in the state, the better. The bickering is sending out a bad message to the electorate.” Sources said there are many contenders for the party president's post. Prominent among them are Asha Kumari, Rohit Thakur and Ram Lal, all winners in the recent Assembly polls, along with heavyweight Kaul Singh who lost. According to party members, Asha Kumari was the first choice for the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader but she had to pay the price for her fracas with a woman police constable on the day   was reviewing the poll results in Shimla. She remains a top contender for the state president's post, given her stature in the party and her contribution towards the party winning the Assembly elections in Punjab, where she was the party in-charge. Observers however feel that the party high command would be reluctant to appoint a Virbhadra loyalist to the post as it has already appointed Mukesh Agnihotri as CLP leader. He is seen to be close to the former CM and now the high command would want to do a balancing act. There is a view that the party needs to appoint someone from the Mandi-Kullu region, a Congress bastion lost in the 2017 polls. The party scored a big zero in Mandi district which sends 10 MLAs in the house of 68 members. It had lost its most powerful leader in this district in Sukh Ram just ahead of the polls as he moved to the BJP camp. With Jai Ram Thakur becoming the BJP chief minister, the power centre has moved to Mandi district as he represents the Seraj seat. Earlier the power centres were in Shimla, Kangra and Hamirpur districts. Many believe that the Congress should appoint a president from the new power centre. Party insiders also point out that this is the right time to develop a second-rung leadership among the youth in the party. Many believe that the young leaders have to be brought to the forefront. This has happened in the BJP, albeit accidentally, with Jai Ram becoming the chief minister. “Virbhadra did not allow a second rung leadership to develop. Since 2012 he was heard saying that this would be his last political battle but he is nursing his political ambitions even today. On one side he wants to lead the party in yet another battle and on the other Sukhu wants his tenure to extend as much as it can while banking on the support from the central leadership,” said Congress functionary. Meanwhile, continuing with his pressure tactics to get Sukhu removed, Virbhadra is reportedly planning a show of strength in Kangra on June 16. He has called a meeting of the Congress leaders including present and former MLAs that will be attended by the CLP leader Agnihotri. Kangra is the district that sends maximum number of 15 MLAs to the state assembly. The party could win just three seats of Palampur, Kangra and Fatehpur in the recent polls. Virbhadra intends to tour the district before the meeting. The move is seen as a major attempt to isolate Sukhu. “The party high command needs to streamline the Congress functioning as soon as possible if it wants a good result in the Lok Sabha polls. Till now the party cadres and supporters were demoralised as the BJP was getting walk overs in most of the state polls but the recent wins in by-polls and Karnataka have rejuvenated the worker who now needs proper leadership,” said a Congress functionary. Will the high command intervene to set the house in order or will it allow the 'Congress culture' prevail ? Only time will tell.",2018-06-15,, Congress refuses to learn from last year's Himachal drubbing | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/congress-refuses-to-learn-from-last-year-s-himachal-drubbing-118086.html
233,Neeraj Thakur,"In 1999, Ramesh Kumar (name changed) was selected for India's most coveted job known as the Indian Administrative Services (IAS). Kumar managed to crack the civil services exam in his third attempt. It involved four years of rigorous studies, putting up at a dungeon-like small room near Delhi's Old Rajendra Nagar.  After spending 19 years in the service, rising from the rank of sub-divisional magistrate and donning various hats in different departments of his allocated state, Kumar has finally reached the rank of a director in one of the ministries in the Union government, his next promotion will be make him a joint secretary. But Kumar is a worried man these days, as the government has introduced a system of lateral entry in the bureaucracy at the level of Joint Secretary. This coveted position in the government is the real chance at making national level policies. However, the   government feels that there is not enough talent within the Indian bureaucracy and it needs to call people from the private sector to help the government formulate better policies in future. Kumar feels that the bureaucrats who join Indian Civil services have a set criteria after which they are chosen for the job of managing and formulating government policies. But the idea of lateral entry makes the choice of a lateral entrant arbitrary. Anyone who is close to the incumbent government will get the position, making it difficult for bureaucrats who came through UPSC. Then there is the issue of bypassing constitutional mandate of providing quota for historically oppressed castes. If the government allows lateral entry without following the criteria of caste representation, it will eventually, in all likelihood, affect the representation from the marginalised sections of society. Dalit activists have realised the dangers for their community in the proposed policy and have planned a nation-wide protest in the coming months to create pressure against such a measure. Apart from being arbitrary and anti-reservation, the policy of lateral entry, in its current form would also breed instability in the system. The government circular says that a lateral entrant will be chosen for a period of 3 years with a possibility of extension by another two years. This means that a person who comes from the private sector will never have the security that a permanent officer from IAS/IPS/IFS cadres enjoys. This permanency of job, gives bureaucrats the power to not be afraid of politicians who in an extreme case of insubordination can order for the transfer of a bureaucrat. Bureaucracy is meant to help politicians run the country, without the burden of subordination. But the tenure of 3+2 years makes a lateral entrant vulnerable and desperate in front of the minister who is heading the ministry of his charge. Moreover, how would the government ensure that the private sector person who has come for a period of only 5 years does not try to secure his future by favouring a particular corporate through his inputs in the policy documents? Will a lateral entrant make a better policy because of his specialised experience? The 'specialist vs generalist' debate is as old as the bureaucracy in India. To understand this debate, one needs to understand the structure of India's policy-making set up. An IAS officer, after becoming the sub-divisional magistrate starts working in some block of India. From that time on, his role is to oversee law and order, general administration, and developmental work. After spending two decades in different parts of India, he becomes well-versed with the reality of the country, its diversity, differences within communities as well as socio-economic conditions of the people. This first hand experience of dealing with people, gives him the required understanding of the possibilities and limitations of any government decision in the form of a policy. On the other hand, there are experts who have dedicated their life to just one subject giving them the edge in domain knowledge. Who will make a better policy, say, on the coal sector? A man who has spent 15 years tracking coal prices, quality and its mining technologies may appear a winner when it comes to imagining a policy document a one-way process where the government's order is supreme. But in the real world, especially India, a policy has to be implemented on ground, therefore, during its formulation, the person in charge must be aware of the any sort of backlash that coal mining will face in different parts of the country. The understanding of local communities and their behaviour is something that cannot be purchased or picked up in any university of the world. This is why traditionally, bureaucrats have been formulating government policies with the help of technocrats. And remember, those technocrats are also permanent government officers who have spent their lifetime working with politicians and bureaucrats to understand the ground realities of a diverse country like India. There is a weight in the argument that a bureaucrat should not be in charge of Air India. At the same time, a private sector person - with a tenure of just 5 years and no understanding of India's natural resources and its interface with country's human resources - should not be in charge of drafting policy.. A few reports, quoting government sources have suggested staff shortage at the top level is forcing government of India to look for talent outside. Nothing can be farther from the truth in this case because it is in government's hand to increase the number of hiring at the bottom of pyramid to promote more number of people from the civil services for the top 4 positions in the hierarchy of policy-making in India. Data shows that over the years the governments in power have constantly reduced the number of new appointees through UPSC exams. In the current year, for which Preliminary exams have just been held there are less than 750 seats that the government plans to fill through a 3 level selection process. Every year around 6 lakh people appear for civil services exam in India and it is ridiculous to argue that from such a large pool of applicants, the government does not find the talent that can be promoted to the JS level, in the years to come.",2018-06-16,, Govt vs IAS?

234,Charu Kartikeya,"In the killing of Sirajuddin Ansari and Murtaza Ansari at the hands of a mob in Jharkhand's Godda district, the wave of bigotry that has taken over the state since 2016 has once again raised its head. Memories of the murder and hanging of Mohammad Majloom and Inayatullah Khan in Latehar in 2016 were still fresh, when Alimuddin Ansari was lynched in Ramgarh in 2017. The Godda killings just a year later have once again highlighted the credentials of the state as a hotbed of violence in the name of the cow. Police have claimed that the Ansari duo were a part of gang of five who had stolen buffaloes, were caught by villagers and  . Two FIRs have been filed, one for murder and rioting against the accused and another for theft against the dead victims. Police have arrested four of those accused of murder and are also on the look-out for others suspected to be part of the mob. There is no way to predict at this point of time which way will this case go. While the state government showed remarkable agility in solving the 2017 case and bringing the guilty to book, the 2016 case is languishing miserably. The Godda case is being presented as a case of spontaneous reaction and not an outcome of the sinister cow-protection movement that claimed lives in the other cases. However, as Catch pointed out earlier, Jharkhand has seen a lot of activity connected to cow-protection campaign since 2014. These included mushrooming of cow-protection outfits, vigilante action against cattle traders and increased activity of   (preachers who tell stories about the significance of the cow). The outfits and their members have been linked to the Sangh Parivar and have even been convicted in at least one of the cases. BJP district media cell in-charge Nityanand Mahato was convicted in the Ramgarh case and the alleged mastermind in the Latehar case was suspected to be a Bajrang Dal . In the Godda case, no links with BJP, RSS or any of its off-shoots have been found so far, but local BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has left little to imagination. In a clear endorsement of the criminal conduct of the accused, Dubey has announced that he will bear the legal expenses of the four accused. Dubey reportedly expressed indignation at the fact that though the entire village was involved in the lynching, only these four had been “ ”. The absence of remorse for the crime and for the lives it claimed was telling. CM Das continues to be silent on the incident, just like he has been tight-lipped over the last three years through all the multiple incidents of violence across the state. Of all the states where the multiple incidents of such killings have taken place (Mohammad Akhlaq in Uttar Pradesh in 2015 and Pehlu Khan in Rajasthan in 2017), Das's responsibility is the biggest because his state is turning out to be a repeat offender, year after year.

235,Gowhar  Geelani,"“This welcome report reaffirms the demands of various domestic and international human rights organisations for Indian and Pakistani authorities to deliver justice for past and ongoing human rights abuses, and protect the freedoms of all people in Kashmir,”  Aakar Patel, executive director of Amnesty International India, said. “Both India and Pakistan should fulfil their obligations under international human rights law and end the atmosphere of impunity in Kashmir by conducting effective, impartial, and independent investigations into human rights abuses by armed forces. They should also end the use of repressive laws and respect the right of all people to peacefully express their opinions,” he added. The 49-page report highlights “a situation of chronic impunity for violations committed by security forces”.In a major embarrassment to the  -led government, the United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights has released a detailed report on the situation of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir from June 2016 to April 2018. It accuses Indian armed forces of “unlawful killings by using brute force, sexual violence against female-folk, use of one of the most dangerous weapons pellet-firing shotguns against civilian population.” The Union Ministry of External Affairs rejected the report, saying: “It is fallacious, tendentious, motivated. It violates India’s sovereignty, territorial integrity. Protest conveyed. Deeply concerned that individual prejudices are being allowed to undermine the credibility of a UN institution.” According to the report, a resolution ""can only be brought about by meaningful dialogue that includes the people of Kashmir.” The executive summary of the report, dated 14 June, 2018, stated that after Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani’s killing in July 2016 in South Kashmir, “Indian security forces responded to protests with force, which led to casualties and a wide range of alleged related human rights violations throughout the summer of 2016 and into 2018.” According to it: “... in responding to demonstrations that started in July 2016, Indian security forces used excessive force that led to unlawful killings and a very high number of injuries. Civil society estimates are that 130 to 145 civilians were killed by security forces between mid-July 2016 and end of March 2018, and 16 to 20 civilians were killed by armed groups in the same period…” It also criticises pellets: “One of the most dangerous weapons used against protesters during the unrest in 2016 was the pellet-firing shotgun, which is a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun that fires metal pellets."" According to the report, the current round of civilian protests seems to involve more people than the past: “While Indian-Administered Kashmir has experienced waves of protests in the past—in the late 1980s to early 1990s, 2008 and 2010—this current round of protests appears to involve people than the past, and the profile of protesters has also shifted to include more young, middle-class Kashmiris, including females who do not appear to have been participating in the past…"" The report “covers both the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir (consisting of the Kashmir Valley, the Jammu and Ladakh regions) and Pakistan-Administered Kashmir (Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan)”, but “the focus of the report is on the situation of human rights in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir from July 2016 to April 2018 over which period allegations of widespread and serious human rights violations were received, notably excessive use of force by Indian security forces that led to numerous civilian casualties.” According to the report: “Over 1,000 people were detained under the PSA (Public Safety Act) between March 2016 and August 2017. Human rights groups had warned Jammu and Kashmir authorities that minors were being arrested under the PSA in 2016 and 2017.” The report accused armed forces of obstructing medical services that had a severe impact on the injured and general civilian population. The executive summary added that “widespread protests, long periods of curfew and frequent strikes in 2016 and 2017 had a cumulative impact on students and their right to education.” In point number 13, the report accused Indian authorities of failure to “independently investigate and prosecute allegations of sexual violence by security forces personnel.” According to the report: “There remains an urgent need to address past and ongoing human rights violations and to deliver justice for all people in Kashmir who have been suffering seven decades of conflict. Any resolution to the political situation in Kashmir should entail a commitment to ending the cycles of violence and accountability for past and current human rights violations and abuses committed by all parties and redress for victims. Such a resolution can only be brought about by meaningful dialogue that includes the people of Kashmir.” Srinagar-based human rights defender Khurram Parvez described the UN report on Kashmir as “a path breaking report on human rights situation in Jammu & Kashmir.” “This report is historical and symbolically a huge step leading to an acknowledgment of Indian government's role in massive human rights abuses. After UN resolutions on Kashmir, this report is an important addition.

236,Charu Kartikeya,"Much has been made of the absence of some of the stalwarts of Indian politics from Congress President  's iftar. At least four top leaders who had attended HD Kumaraswamy's swearing-in as chief minister of Karnataka to present a picture of Opposition unity – Mamata Banerjee, Sharad Pawar,   and   – did not attend. However, does that necessarily mean a boycott? As has already been reported, none of the parties that these leaders head went unrepresented at the iftar. Dinesh Trivedi, DP Tripathi and Satish Chandra Mishra were there on behalf of Banerjee, Pawar and Mayawati, respectively. Even Yadav had sent an emissary, a source who attended the iftar told Catch, but it is yet to emerge clearly who this representative was. Mayawati is in any case known to stay away from functions hosted by other parties. Barring Yadav, the presence of confidantes of the other leaders amounts to an unequivocal expression of solidarity with the  . The absence of the satraps themselves could be attributed to various factors. A senior Opposition leader who attended the iftar, told Catch on the condition of anonymity that he did not get that feeling at the iftar which the next-morning newspapers tried to portray. He said the general atmosphere at the gathering was of bonhomie and in the spirit of collaboration. The source also underlined that the presence of other senior leaders of the parties concerned should be enough to scotch misgivings about any kind of rift. He did add, though, that when a rainbow coalition is in the making, the various players should be allowed to have bargaining chips of their own to balance their own interests with that of the alliance. Another senior leader of the Opposition unequivocally said that media was mischievously playing up the absence of some leaders. He said this was a social gathering and did not necessarily demand the same level of attendance that a political gathering like Kumarasamy's swearing-in demanded. He added that all those leaders who were invited and were in Delhi attended the iftar. Many have conjectured that by staying away from the event, Pawar, Banerjee, Mayawati and Yadav did send one message to the Congress, though – Rahul Gandhi is junior in experience to all of them and so it would be hard for them to signal that he shall be the leader of a multi-party alliance that is still in the works. This is borne out by the fact that they have all attended gatherings hosted by former Congress president   in the past. Gandhi and Mayawati even shared a warm hug and held hands as recently at Kumaraswamy's swearing-in. With about a year to go for the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, there is a long journey ahead for the Opposition. Key issues like seat-sharing and alliance leadership are yet to be thrashed out and events like the swearing-in and the iftar are just the beginning.

When Sinha, who has led the party in West Bengal in the past, visited Satyajit Ray's favourite actor to present him with a booklet of the  -led government's “achievements”, Chatterjee gave him a piece of his mind. Demonetisation, he said, was a harassment for the common people. Under Shah's guidance, BJP leaders have started visiting celebrities and intellectuals to seek support, with General Elections less than a year away. Chatterjee used the opportunity to speak his mind. “Demonetisation wasn't practical. I am not aware about its long-term effects as I am not an economists. But the move caused hardships for the people, who had to change large amounts at one go,” he told Sinha.  Demonetization was a sudden attempt and taken without proper precautions, leading to disruptions in normal life for quite a few months, said the actor who has been known for his Left leanings. Unlike many of his colleagues, he never switched sides to back the ruling Trinamool Congress.

238,Rajeev Khanna,"One thing is for certain, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh will occupy a central place in the Congress' strategy for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The reason is simple as Punjab is the only state that turned the  's (BJP) dream of a “Congress Mukt Bharat” sour. Despite the financial crunch and other shortcomings, Amarinder has been trying to deftly raise issues like farm distress that will form the core of the political narrative ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. What he has been doing is to put the ball in the BJP-led central government's court on these issues. The aim is to catch the BJP on the wrong foot. All eyes will now be on how the   led government will address these concerns that not only impact the large farmer population not only in Punjab but across India. Amarinder had set the ball rolling by announcing a partial farm loan waiver in Punjab last year. Despite all the criticism regarding its implementation, he still holds the high moral ground of having initiated the process, although partially. It was after his initiative that various BJP governments also announced the waivers. Now as the polls get nearer, it is obvious that the noise around farm issues is going to get shriller. Observers say that the Congress will be playing up this waiver given by Amarinder along with the Rs 70,000 crore waiver that the UPA 1 government had given in 2008 as the campaign heats up for states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh that go to polls later this year and subsequently for the Lok Sabha polls. Amarinder played yet another deft move on Sunday when he asked Modi to constitute a committee which would have members from the union government along with some chief ministers to formulate a blueprint of a national debt waiver scheme for farmers in consultation with the states. Addressing a meeting of the NITI Aayog, he underlined the importance of accepting the MS Swaminathan panel report in totality and pointed that the governing council should consider the issue of agricultural loan waiver at the national level on priority. Underlining Punjab’s important role in the defence and food security of the nation, Amarinder made a strong case for debt relief for the farmers, pointing out that his government had already announced a scheme for institutional crop loan waiver in the state to all the marginal and small farmers having outstanding crop loans up to Rs.2 lakh, thus providing relief to 10.25 lakh farmers. It was on last Wednesday that Amarinder announced the disbursement of Rs. 209 crore to remaining 38,000 marginal farmers, who are members of cooperative societies, within the next ten days to complete the first phase of his government’s debt relief scheme. He said that in the second phase, small farmers linked with cooperative societies would be taken up for disbursement of relief. Commercial banks have already started uploading the data of their loanee farmers on the specially designed portal for this purpose. Subsequently, marginal farmers belonging to the cooperative societies which have not yet received the full eligible amount up to Rs. 2 lakh and are otherwise eligible to receive relief amount due to them for the loans secured from the commercial banks, would also be covered. Amarinder said the promise made to the farmers before the assembly elections of 2017 would be fulfilled at all costs. At the NITI Aayog meeting on Sunday Amarinder sought procurement of alternate crops such as maize, oil seeds and pulses by central agencies, besides urging the central government to incentivize farmers through a conditional cash transfer by way of non-burning bonus of Rs. 100 per quintal on paddy, in order to check the problem of burning of paddy straw. He said that while farm machinery is being subsidised for farmer groups and cooperative societies by his government and stubble burning had come down down in 2017 from 2016, the problem still remains serious. During the 10-day farmers' strike early this month also Amarinder had played up the issue of loan waiver while attacking the union agriculture and farmers' welfare minister Radhamohan Singh for reportedly calling the farmers agitation a publicity stunt. He had lashed out at the central government for its complete apathy to the problems of the distressed farmers, many of whom were committing suicide, around the country. Claiming to be in complete sympathy with the protesting farmers, Amarinder had asked what else could the farmers be expected to do when their and their families’ survival is at stake. He said the farmers are suffering as a result of the central government’s failure to waive off their debts, which many state governments, including Punjab, have been repeatedly seeking, and also to give them the due price for their produce. He had underlined that if a bankrupt state like Punjab could do its bit for loan waiver, why could the central government not come up with a waiver scheme? He said the Centre lacked the will and the intent to come to the rescue of the beleaguered farmers. In his address at the NITI Aayog meet, Amarinder called for special one-time infrastructure development package for border areas for Punjab that has an active International Border with thickly populated border districts. Lamenting that the criteria for allocation of funds under the Border Areas Development Programme remained unfavourable to Punjab, he sought acquisition of lands that lie beyond the border fence by the central government, along with incentives for industry in the border area. He also aired a demand for tax incentives and promotional schemes for the border belt on the lines of hilly and north-eastern regions. Another demand put forward by him is special development and maintenance of border roads in Punjab under the national highway programme. Amarinder has also asked the Centre to include Punjab rivers for capital assistance on the lines of the Ganga Action Plan. If the Centre fails to address these demands, the Congress will be upping the ante on them during the campaign as it would help put BJP ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on the mat in Punjab. Observers say that as the politics heats up, Amarinder is expected to directly take on the Centre on different issues which his party will amplify in other states during the campaign. He did this in the run-up to the Punjab polls on issues like demonetisation and calling the bluff on tension-building on the International Border after the 'surgical strike' carried out by Indian Army in Kashmir. This time the stakes are higher for the Congress and he will be expected to play a key role in the strategy. It remains to be seen how he delivers.",2018-06-18,, Captain attacks Modi govt on farmers.

239,Charu Kartikeya,"It has been quite a spectacle to see Congress spokespersons bickering with a senior journalist on social media over the latter's advice for their party to back Delhi Chief Minister  . He is on a sit-in at the office cum residence of Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal. He is demanding that LG should order Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers in the Delhi government to end their strike and resume their work. The Delhi CM's demand has found widespread support among top leaders of the Opposition as well as the   (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Apart from four CMs who visited Kejriwal's residence (Mamata Banerjee, HD Kumaraswamy, Chandrababu Naidu and Pinarayi Vijayan) and expressed their support for his struggle, many others have backed the   chief. Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary  , Rashtriya   (RJD) leader  , rebel BJP leaders Yashwant Sinha and Shatrughan Sinha and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Working President MK Stalin have also expressed support. Support was also forthcoming from  , a BJP ally, former diplomat KC Singh and former Union Health Secretary K Sujatha Rao. The Congress party continues to steadfastly refuse to be a part of this long list and is slamming Kejriwal day after day. Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi has asserted that her party “isn't obligated to support AAP” and that democracy gives her party the “right to choose who & what to support”. She's right on that count but what she has cleverly tried to hide in that repartee that it is not Congress's obligation but priority that is being questioned in this debate. It is important to filter through the theatrics to clearly see what is at play here. For over three years now, the AAP-led government in Delhi has suffered at the hands of a malicious campaign run by the BJP-led Union government. The LG vs CM standoff, being discussed right now because of Kejriwal's dharna, is only one facet of this multi-pronged campaign. The complete set of instruments to perpetually trouble AAP and its government have included: At the foundation of the present impasse is allegation by Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash that AAP MLAs assaulted him at CM's residence in the latter's presence. Prakash made the allegation nearly four months ago, leading Delhi Police to promptly lodge a case and initiate a probe.  In an unprecedented spectacle, a posse of policemen even raided the CM's residence to, ostensibly, seize CCTV footage. For all their diligence, police are yet to even file charge-sheet in the case, let alone prove conclusively that the assault did take place. However, this has not deterred IAS officers posted in the Delhi government's various departments from stopping work in protest, demonstrating blind faith in Prakash's allegation. By their own admission, since February, they have been consistently refusing to attend several meeting called by AAP ministers. They say they do not feel safe attending these meetings. In any other state or in a Union government department, such a conduct by any bureaucrat would have attracted initiation of disciplinary action. Bureaucrats are Constitutionally bound to serve elected governments, but not in Delhi. Prime Minister  , otherwise, sings paeans to co-operative federalism but does not believe that this engineered paralysis in Delhi is an assault on the spirit of federalism. What is an embattled chief minister to do, in such a situation? The Congress party is afraid of AAP and it has its reasons. AAP was born out of a movement that was essentially anti-Congress. When the movement transformed into a party and also came to power, it didn't just send the Congress out of power in Delhi, it reduced the Congress to zero in the state assembly. Voter groups that had been die-hard Congress supporters for decades abandoned the party and adopted AAP overnight. It is this fear that is generating the Congress's inability to see that in not supporting AAP even amid this turmoil, it is essentially supporting the BJP's excesses. How will this approach enable the Congress to seek public support in its own fight against the BJP? Party after party and leader after leader in the Opposition camp has demonstrated on multiple occasions now that the presence of AAP in their ranks is not only desirable but necessary. However, the Congress has consistently resisted this nudge, with even   and now   refusing to invite AAP for Opposition gatherings hosted by them. For a united Opposition to take on BJP effectively in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress' hostility towards AAP will have to end. However, any indication of that happening anytime soon is not in sight.",2018-06-18,, Why Congress's steadfast refusal to back AAP is a damaging manouvre | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-congress-s-steadfast-refusal-to-back-aap-is-a-damaging-manouvre-118487.html
240,Riyaz Wani,"Though there was little that was visible on the outside, tense disagreements over the handling of the worsening situation in the state marked the coalition over the past one-and-a-half month. It began with the Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti’s call for a unilateral ceasefire in the Valley, which the state BJP initially said it didn’t support but later centre went ahead and announced the halt in operations against militants during holy month of Ramzan. And it ended with the killing of journalist Shujaat Bukhari, which apparently proved a last straw. The state BJP has revealed these differences in a detailed statement shortly after the party  withdrew its support. “Insistence of the PDP for extension of ceasefire and a soft approach towards militants, Pakistan and separatists was only hurting the nationalistic sentiments, not only in Jammu and Kashmir but in the whole of the country,” BJP spokesman Sunil Sethi said.  “PDP had underestimated the resolve of Bhartiya Janata Party in thinking that the PDP will have its way in all matters. The door has been rightly shown to it and all forces inimical to national interest that there is strong resolve of nation to stay together and to be ready for any sacrifice for the unity and integrity of the country.” The party has also revealed its future plan of action in the state: “Now is the time of an all-out war with militants and their supporters and they will not find a place to hide and run. It was highly unfortunate that our partner was always trying to tie our hands from taking strong measures against enemies of the nation. “Expecting that a mighty India will bow down to have dialogues with separatists or Pakistan and its armed stooges is indicative that it (PDP) was living in a fool's paradise.” Both the National Conference and the Congress have refused to extend support to the PDP.  “The National Conference has neither been approached by any party nor would they offer their support to any party,” NC Vice-President Omar Abdullah told reporters after meeting Governor NN Vohra. Omar supported Governor’s rule in the state and said he had assured Governor of his party’s support. Omar also batted for early elections. Similarly state Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir termed the alliance PDP-BJP alliance unholy. ""It was expected to break from day one. They had betrayed the people of the state and supporters of the respective parties. They sought votes on opposing agendas,"" Mir said. Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has already ruled out support to the PDP. The NC has 15 seats and Congress 12 in the J&K Assembly.When the People's Democratic Party (PDP) –   (BJP) government was formed in 2015, it began with a due sense of trepidation about its political and ideological fallout for the state. The coalition’s single-most redeeming feature was the promise it held of the economic recovery of the state and the hope of a political process towards resolution of the Kashmir issue.  The expectation was not unfounded. The Agenda of Alliance forged by the two parties contained development and political commitments to the effect. But a few months into its term political and ideological confrontations between the partners took centrestage, almost hobbling the government. It didn’t make any headway with even the then urgent rehabilitation of the flood victims, taking as long as 15 months to fulfil. The government’s fall in the wake of the BJP pulling out its support to   has come as an inglorious end to an alliance long teetering on the edge. However, nobody in the state could have imagined even in their wildest dreams that it will be the BJP, which will quit the alliance. This was deemed to be the prerogative of the PDP only which had enabled a Hindu nationalist party to rule India’s only Muslim majority state for the first time in the past 70 years.  So, the BJP move is certain to have left PDP in an embarrassing position. The party had gone against its long-standing ideological position in Kashmir and the nature of its electoral mandate to ally with the BJP. It stuck to the alliance even through five-month-long unrest in 2016 when a New Delhi backed hard-line response to the protests left around 100 people killed and several hundred completely or partially blinded. For Mehbooba, the loss will be greater. The alliance has left her political reputation in tatters.  A reputation she had built brick by brick. At one time she successfully incarnated as a leader who was a relatively more credible mainstream political proponent of a shade of Kashmiri nationalism willing to settle for a respectable political deal within the Indian Constitution. But, in power, Mehbooba burnt herself out far sooner than even her predecessor Omar Abdullah. And now with the BJP leaving her in the lurch, she hasn’t been left a place to hide.",2018-06-19,, Mehbooba CM no more: A doomed coalition all along | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/mehbooba-cm-no-more-a-doomed-coalition-all-along-118645.html
241,Rajeev Khanna,"  Play of words and coining new phrases has come to be the core of Sangh Parivar politics. The Sangh Parivar has invested quite a lot of time and energy over the last over three decades on coining new terms for creating and propagating the 'enemy'. This 'enemy' is anyone who questions the RSS and its affiliates on their propagation of falsehoods and hate. The target has mainly been the liberal and the secular populace of the country. The trail of the terminology invented to take on the enemy is a long one and is presently concentrated on making the gullible masses accept the new creation of a phenomenon called the 'urban Maoist'. It will be some time when some new term is coined and the emphasis of propaganda is shifted towards it. This article aims to go back in time to trace this journey of the Sangh Parivar phraseology that first became noticeable when it grew in decibels during the Babri Masjid-Ram Janambhoomi movement of the 1980s. While the diatribe was always against minorities, particularly Muslims, at that point of time the enemy that was created was described as 'pseudo secular'. The   (BJP) and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) who were spearheading the movement could be heard ranting against 'pseudo seculars' painting them black in every speech that they made while the most derogatory terms were obviously reserved for the Muslims. Leaders right from Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti and the likes kept on harping about the ills brought to the country by “pseudo seculars”. Among the masses they described pseudo seculars as persons who talked of equality but pandered to the minorities thus playing the game of minority appeasement. On platforms like the Liberhan Commission that was probing the Babri Mosque demolition they tried to bring out the difference between the 'Nehruvian Secularism' and the traditional western concept of secularism during their deposition. One remembers Advani's deposition where he dwelt at length about the de facto and de jure character of the disputed site while also talking about Huntington's theory of clash of civilisations. The BJP and its other Sangh Parivar affiliates continued to harp on the “pseudo secular” enemy as their strength grew in the Parliament and the state assemblies in the next one decade. By the time the Gujarat pogrom against Muslims took place in the aftermath of the 58 Karsewaks being burnt in the Godhra incident the term 'pseudo' was dropped and the foot soldiers on the ground started calling the enemy just secular or secularist. This reporter often came across people underling with confidence, “Gujarat has come out of the shadow of the philosophy of Gandhi (non-violence). Remember one thing the next round of violence will be against the seculars.” Being secular that was referred to 'Bin Sampradayik' in Gujarati had become a dangerous term and openly confessing to being one drew hostilities. Thereafter, for a brief while there was the usage of the term 'Secular fundamentalist' but for reasons unknown it never became a part of the political narrative of the Hindutva groups. By the middle of the last decade the internet had started making its presence felt a long way and the BJP started making maximum use of the social media to propagate its ideology. This is something which is envied by people of all the other political parties. The BJP was the first to hire an army of IT professionals who fought a war in the cyberspace. What followed in the era of trolling was new terminologies targeting the liberals and political opponents. These ranged from dubbing the latter as 'Libtard' and 'AAPtard'. In the process the term secular underwent another transformation in Sangh Parivar and became 'Sickular'. But there was another problem at hand. It was about running down activists who have been opposing the plundering of natural resources and giving a voice to the marginalised tribals in the states that have come to be identified as a part of the Red Corridor, an area under the influence of extreme left or Naxailtes or Maoists. Also there has been a problem in running down the activists talking on behalf of the Dalits. In the first case the activists may or may not have links with the banned Maoist groups or parties. But the effort visible in the narrative now is to paint everyone questioning the government for its attitude towards the tribals and Dalits as an 'urban Maoist'. It was none other than the Delhi Chief Minister   who first got the nomenclature of an 'urban Naxalite' from the BJP leadership. The phenomenon has been visible with regards to the recent arrest of five activists for the Bhima-Koregaon violence where lines were blurred to dub even Ambedkarites as 'urban Maoists' in the narrative that has flown to the gullible masses. Hence the game of changing terminology in the face of political convenience continues. Prominent author, dramatist and political commentator Shamsul Islam points out, “They have had to change their terminology from time to time because none of them have sustained and resonated before the masses. In fact, the secular and liberal forces instead of being defensive should ask the Sangh Parivar about their own pseudo nationalism. They should be asked what are they if all others are pseudo seculars, anti-nationals and Maoists.” He further said, “They should be asked what is your agenda. When you take out a Tiranga Yatra there are hundreds of saffron flags for one tricolour. You are the ones who want to implement Manusmriti in the country and were opposed to the tricolour as the national flag way back in 1947 when the country became independent. Through the Ram Mandir movement and the subsequent communal riots you delivered what fanatic Muslim outfits opposed to Indian unity wanted. You created a divide between the two communities. It will not come as a surprise if every Dalits is dubbed a Maoist. The state can arrest members of the banned Maoist groups or parties but not everyone in the name of Maoism. Maoist thought even forms a part of the curriculum in various universities.” Eminent political analyst Achyut Yagnik says, “Its an old practice to change the terminology to suit their convenience. During the run up to the 2002 Gujarat assembly elections   was constantly talking about Miyan Musharraf (referring to the Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf). While 'Miyan' is used as a slur by Sangh Parivar members and supporters in Gujarat Modi would never use the term in Uttar Pradesh where it is an expression of respect and dignity. The same Modi had switched to talking about 'Swarnim Gujarat' five years later while conveniently forgetting 'Miyan Musharraf'. Now the use of term 'urban Maoists' suits them for their politics in the Hindi heartland.” It is a poll year with both the Lok Sabha and several state elections on the anvil both before and after the parliamentary polls. One can only hope to see several new additions to the Sangh Parivar phraseology in the days to come.  ",2018-06-19,, From 'Pseudo Secular' to 'Urban Maoist': How Sangh comes up with new phrases for its enemies | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/from-pseudo-secular-to-urban-maoist-how-sangh-comes-up-with-new-phrases-for-its-enemies-118639.html
242,Anurag Dey,"In a dramatic move the   (BJP) Tuesday pulled out of the  -led Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) government, pushing the state towards Governor’s rule. Blaming alliance partner Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for its inability to handle the deteriorating security scenario in the state, the BJP said it had become “untenable” for it to continue with the alliance formed in 2015. The pullout followed BJP President  ’s meeting with National Security Advisor   and all BJP ministers in the Jammu and Kashmir government. Announcing the pullout in the national capital, BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav held the PDP entirely responsible for the breaking of the alliance and said the decision was unanimous and taken after due consolation with Prime Minister   and party chief Shah. “We discussed the situation in (J&K) at different levels, with the home ministry, with agencies after taking necessary inputs. After consulting the Prime Minister and Amit Shah, we have decided that it is not possible for the BJP to continue with the alliance. It has become untenable for the BJP to continue the alliance government in J&K,” Madhav told the media. Madhav said the PDP was unsuccessful in restoring peace in the Valley and encouraging fast paced development in Jammu and Ladakh regions – the twin agenda with which the BJP-PDP alliance was formed. “In the last three years, the BJP as part of the government performed its function well but that cannot be said for the other side. “The condition that is prevailing is worrisome. Terrorism and violence in the valley has increased, there is rapid radicalisation and the fundamental rights of the citizens are in danger. We have all seen how veteran journalist Shujaat Bhukhari was killed in broad daylight. His chilling murder is an evidence of the situation prevailing there,” he said.  While praising the Modi-led Union government for assisting the state government in every possible way, the BJP said the Mehbooba-led PDP was “not successful” in handling the situation which eventually triggered the BJP’s pull out. “They (PDP) were not fully successful in handling the situation. We don’t question their determination but the reality is that the state government was unsuccessful in discharging its responsibility of improving the situation particularly in the Kashmir Valley,” Madhav said.  He accused the PDP of discriminating the Jammu and Ladakh regions in terms of development work. “In Jammu and Ladakh, our ministers had to face hindrances in ushering in development. All the ministry that we had, we tried to do our best but we are not alone in the government. The people of Jammu and Ladakh feel they are being discriminated,” he claimed. Claiming the pull out decision was in taken for the sake of the country’s integrity and security, the BJP recommended the governor’s rule in the state. “Keeping in view the country's security and sovereignty and keeping in mind that J&K is an integral part of India, its time the reins of power in the state be handed to the governor and the bring the situation under control,” Madhav said. He also said the suspension of the armed operations in the Kashmir Valley during Ramzan failed to evoke any response either from the terrorists or separatists. “We had taken the initiative of ceasefire during Ramzan and expected this will attract a better response from terrorists and separatists. Suspension of operation wasnot a compulsion for us, it was taken from a position of strength but it failed to attract response from them. That is why the home ministry has decided to not to continue with the ceasefire,” he said.  He also defended the decision to enter the unlikely alliance with the PDP in 2014.  “The only possible result that time was governor’s president’s rule if we had not formed the alliance. It was fractured mandate but at the same time it was duty to honour the people’s mandate,” he said adding that the pull out decision was not guided by any fear of losing ground to the PDP.",2018-06-19,, End of road: BJP pulls out of Mehbooba-led govt in Jammu and Kashmir | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/end-of-road-bjp-pulls-out-of-mehbooba-led-govt-in-jammu-and-kashmir-118628.html
243,Anurag Dey,"Hearing the twin petitions, a HC bench of Justices AK Chawla and Navin Chawla questioned as to who authorised the “dharna” by Kejriwal and his Cabinet colleagues. The bench observed that in case of a strike or demonstration, it has to be outside an office. “You cannot hold a strike inside someone's office or residence,"" the court said. Replying to the court’s query, the counsel for the AAP government said that Kejriwal and the ministers were sitting on the dharna in their personal capacity and they were constitutionally empowered to do so. He also informed the bench that the IAS officers have gone on an undeclared strike and not attending crucial meetings thereby bringing urgent public works to a grinding halt. Pointing to an IAS officers' association admitting they have not been attending meetings called by ministers, the counsel pleaded the court to order the ‘undeclared strike’ be ended. Countering the Delhi government’s arguments, the Centre informed the court that IAS officers were not on strike and requested the court to direct Kejriwal and others to vacate the Lt. Governor’s office. After hearing the briefs from both the parties in the two petitions, the bench posted the matters for hearing on 22 June. The petition against Kejriwal’s sit-in has been filed by a Delhi based advocate and has BJP MP Parvesh Singh Sahib and rebel AAP MLA   among others as petitioners. It contends that the demonstration is “un-constitutional and illegal” and has brought the government machinery to a standstill. ""Politicians are required to be upholders of the Constitution. They should not be the breakers of constitutional law. The instant circumstances are the illustration of chaotic administrative paralysis which urgently requires to be streamlined,” reads the petition. The petition seeks the court to direct Kejriwal to discharge chief ministerial obligations and responsibilities as the “entire functioning of the Chief Minister Office of Delhi has been brought to a standstill since the strike was called”. It also sought framing of comprehensive guidelines to ensure legislators “do not indulge in un-constitutional acts”. In a counter petition by advocate activist Umesh Gupta, a direction to end the informal strike by the bureaucrats is sought along with strict action against the IAS officers for violating Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules which prohibit officers from going on strike. Citing media reports and letters by Kejriwal and Co, the petition said that over the past three-four months, the IAS officers holding key departments, have been openly refusing to attend meetings called by the ministers. He said the strike has paralysed urgent public work and issues of preparation for prevention of monsoon-related illness, mohalla clinics, pollution, along with other public works which require urgent attention. The petition also cites letters written by Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia to the LG in February explaining the gravity of situation asking him to intervene. The issue has also become an 'Opposition versus BJP' battle. As many as four non-BJP Chief Ministers – West Bengal's Mamata Banerjee, Kerala's Pinarayi Vijayan, Karnataka's HD Kumaraswamy and Andhra Pradesh's N Chandrababu Naidu have extended support to AAP. Expressing his solidarity with Kejriwal, Communist Party of India-Marxist General Secretary  , participated in a protest march by AAP.   The four chief ministers led by Mamata Banerjee sought Prime Minister  ’s intervention to resolve the issue. “Work has been disrupted for four months; there can be nothing more unfortunate than this. Lt. Governor is the appointed leader, if not he then to whom will one to go to seek time and talk? This is a democracy and that is how a democracy functions,""   Banerjee.  While the BJP too since 15 June has launched a counter-protest against Kejriwal over his dharna, BJP rebel Shatrugan Sinha and ally   have come out in support of AAP.    AAP has also received the support of other Opposition parties like Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam,   and Rashtriya  , in addition to independent politicians Jignesh Mevani, Kamal Haasan and  .The conflict in Delhi between Lt. Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister   has now reached the legal corridors with two petitions being filed before the Delhi High Court. While one petition sought the sit-in protests by the ruling Aam Aadmi Party ( ) to be declared un-constitutional and illegal, a counter petition wants the court to order the informal strike by IAS officers to be called off and administrative action taken against them for violating IAS rules of conduct. On a sit-in demonstration at the Raj Niwas since 11 June, CM Kejriwal and his colleagues have been demanding that Lt. Governor directs IAS officers to end their ""strike"". Both health minister Satyendar Jain and Deputy Chief Minister   are on hunger strike and have been hospitalised. On the other hand, bureaucrats in the national capital are allegedly on strike to protest the “assault” on chief secretary Anshu Prakash in February at Kejriwal's residence and have “not been attending” meetings called by state ministers.  ",2018-06-18,, LG vs Kejriwal fight enters court: 'Who authorised CM’s Dharna?' asks Delhi HC    | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/lg-vs-kejriwal-fight-enters-court-who-authorised-cm-s-dharna-asks-delhi-hc-118485.html
244,Charu Kartikeya,"While announcing their pull-out from the government in Jammu and Kashmir,   (BJP) leaders attributed their decision to three reasons: the rise of “terrorism, violence and radicalisation” in Kashmir Valley; “danger” to “fundamental rights of the citizens” and lack of developmental work in all three regions of the state. More surprising than the sudden withdrawal is the reasons that the party has given. The state of affairs in J&K today are certainly much worse than they were in 2014, before the PDP-BJP alliance took charge. Ceasefire violations have gone up manifold, militancy has only risen, security forces have suffered massive casualties and unrest among the general population has spiked. After jointly presiding over this downturn for more than half a term, how can BJP suddenly distance itself from it? If   was the Chief Minister, BJP had a deputy chief minister. If PDP had 14 ministers in the 25-member Cabinet, BJP had nine. The blame for the worsened crisis in the state can not be for the PDP to bear alone. The lack-of-development theory that the BJP is trying to sell also flies in the face of what the party has been trying to portray ever since it came to power at the Centre. None other than Prime Minister   himself has made it a point to visit J&K every six-eight months. On each occasion, he has also made it a point to either lay the foundation of a development project or inaugurate one. These ribbon-cutting events have been spread across all the three regions – Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. In July 2014, Modi inaugurated the 240 megawatt Uri-II hydropower project, near the Line of Control. During the same visit, he also inaugurated a train to Vaishno Devi from Jammu's Katra. In August 2014, he visited Ladakh to lay the foundation stone of the 330-km Leh-Srinagar transmission line and also inaugurate two hydro-power projects in the region. In November 2015, he announced Rs 80,000 crore package for the state in Srinagar, inaugurated 450 MW Baglihar Hydro Electric Project Stage-II and laid the foundation stone of four-laning of Udhampur-Ramban and Ramban-Banihal section of National Highway 44. In April 2017, Modi inaugurated the Chenani-Nashri tunnel on the Jammu-Srinagar highway. In November 2017, the Union New and Renewable Energy Ministry also announced that a 1.5-mw small hydropower plant had been commissioned in in Biaras Drass of Kargil under the Prime Minister’s Ladakh Renewable Energy Initiative. Most recently, Modi visited the state last month to inaugurate as many as seven projects. These included the 330 mw Kishanganga Hydropower Station in Kashmir's Bandipore, launching of work on the Zojila Tunnel to connect Srinagar, Kargil and Leh, laying the foundation stone of the Srinagar Ring Road, the Pakul Dul Power Project in Jammu's Kishtwar, Jammu Ring Road and also the inauguration of the Tarakote Marg and the Siar Dabri-Bhawan material ropeway at the Vaishno Devi shrine. If PDP was not moving in tandem with the BJP, also in power at the Centre, how were these range of inaugurations happening? The pull-out from the government appears to have been motivated by some other concern. As of now, what this concern is is not clear but the reasons given by BJP are a smokescreen. Adding fuel to these speculations is the PDP's response to the withdrawal. She sent her resignation to the Governor and spoke to the press later. While admitting that she was taken by surprise, neither her words nor demeanor conveyed a sense of hurt or peeve. She also didn't portray the BJP's move as a betrayal. Kashmir is a dark theatre and it is often not known what is going on behind the scenes.

245,Rajeev Khanna,"The continuous stream of atrocities on Dalits coming to limelight is fast turning into the ruling   (BJP)-led Gujarat government's shame. After Gujarat is marketed as a model state by Prime Minister   and BJP National President  . One recalls the time when after Modi's ascent from Gujarat chief minister to Indian prime minister was followed by teams of bureaucrats from Delhi and subsequently from others states that the BJP won to go and study the much promoted 'Gujarat Model'.  The question that continues to rankle the minds of ordinary rational citizens is that why is it that Dalits in Gujarat have to ride a horse in their marriage procession under police protection ? Why is it that they are thrashed for using the suffix 'Sinh' to their name ? Why are they assaulted for for wearing a 'Mojdi' (a pointed footwear associated with royalty)? Why are they targeted for supporting a moustache? Why are they beaten up for watching an upper caste Garba ?  These are issues that go far beyond the routine debate on the issue of job reservation. One does not have to go far into the remote interiors to come across such instances. They galore right under the nose of the state government in districts of Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad and Mehsana.  After a video going viral on 14 June of a youth from Valmiki community being beaten up brutally for being well dressed and claiming to be from the upper caste Darbar community has followed the instance of a Dalit riding a horse back under police protection for his marriage ceremony. According to reports the police have booked 10 people from upper castes for threatening Prashant Solanki for riding a horse for his wedding procession at a village in Gandhinagar district on Sunday. Prashant had reportedly arrived by car at Parsa village of of Mansa taluka and was scheduled to cover the last mile to the wedding venue on a horseback in accordance with the prevalent tradition. However, before he arrived, some upper caste persons spotted a youth waiting with a decorated horse. When they came to know that the decorated horse was meant for the wedding procession of a Dalit they threatened the boy making him flee in panic. Reports say that later, the village sarpanch arranged another horse for the Dalit youth but the celebratory mood had changed as the procession now went under police protection, following threats from people coming from upper castes. Besides the ceremonies got delayed by as many as four hours. It is common knowledge in villages where feudal mindset continues to prevail that a large number of influential Darbars still believe in being above others in social hierarchy considering themselves to be royal descendants. The idea of well-dressed Dalits riding horses and sporting moustaches is still not palatable to a large number of them. Hence, resent the idea of Dalits sporting heavy moustache, dressing well and riding horses during wedding processions. “It is not that there has been a sudden splurge in atrocities. The thing that has changed is that these instances are now getting highlighted instantly in the form of videos and reports going viral on social media. Earlier these instances were suppressed at the village level itself. There was no media reportage and hence no reaction from the government. The emphasis was on striking a compromise at the village level,” points out a Dalit and Right to Information (RTI) activist based at Gandhinagar. He added that at the same time despite registration of cases, the matter gets diluted in courts and quite often the accused get bail easily. “There have been occasions that the accused have come out on bail only to threaten the victim once again. An interesting aspect of the phenomenon is that at present the Dalit MLAs from the ruling party are in a corner. On one side the BJP leadership is pressuring them to contain the Dalit anger and on the other the community is accusing them of failing to take up the cause of the community,” he added. “The matter of concern here is that there is no effective political leadership among the Dalits. They have been elected on reserved seats with the support of the  , Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal activists to fill in the blanks. “They just act as stamp pads of the Hindutva organizations who set the political agenda for them. It is a matter of research why they come out with political narrative on religion and not caste after they are elected,” points out Maulik Shrimali, a Dalit activist from Nadiad. He says that despite the political reservation, Dalits are never treated as an ally in governance and there is no effective participation from them in the ruling dispensation. The Dalits are particularly peeved over the political leadership in the government keeping mum on the increasing number of atrocities coming to light. “Minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja has not come out with any statement on this issue. Perhaps he does not want to say anything against his own Darbar community which is his core voter base. “The government has instead been fielding police and administrative officials to address the agitated Dalits. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has not bothered to visit the family of any of the victims of the caste atrocities,” pointed the Dalit activist based in Gandhinagar. “We have been hearing of Rupani convening emergency meetings to address the plight of cows and lions but he has shown no emergency when it comes to the continuing assault on Dalits. We do not oppose his concern for cows, but he should have some sensitivity towards Dalits also who are human beings,” Shrimali said. “The growing number of instances coming to light also show the hollowness of the ruling class. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given a statement saying that kill me but not my Dalit brothers but he has been unable to stop the atrocities even in his home district of Mehsana,” he added. The Dalits account for just seven per cent of the voting population in Gujarat and are further helpless on account of being widely scattered. But instances of atrocities on them send across a strong message against the BJP in other states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where their presence is considerable. The BJP cannot afford such instances coming to light regularly in the poll year. The RSS through its frontal organisations like Samajik Samrasta Manch and Sewa Bharti is trying to send the message of inclusion to the Dalits. These organizations recently honoured the students from Scheduled Castes who had cleared the central and state administrative services exams where the speakers propagated the ideals of cultural nationalism. How the BJP contains the political fall out of cases of atrocities hitting headlines however remains to be seen.",2018-06-20,, Why Dalit atrocities in Gujarat coming to limelight is becoming BJP's shame  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-dalit-atrocities-in-gujarat-coming-to-limelight-is-becoming-bjp-s-shame-118829.html
246,Atul Chandra,"  The Uttar Pradesh government’s obsession with the meat and leather industry has tended to complicate the situation in the state and cause immense harm to sections of Muslims and Dalits who are dependent on these industries. On June 6 the government ordered the closure of all Kanpur tanneries --- there are 400 tanneries in the Jajmau area of Kanpur alone --- for a period of three months starting December 15, 2018 in view of the Ardh Kumbh fair at Allahabad. The orders were issued by Chief Minister   at a meeting of tannery owners in Lucknow. He also ordered regular monitoring of effluents discharged by the tanneries into the Ganga. With the Ganga flowing downstream towards Allahabad, effluents from tanneries pollute the river. With most of the tanneries failing to install effluent treatment plants, the polluted water poses a health hazard to millions of bathers. Taj Alam, president of the Tannery Owners’ Association, reportedly found the complete shutdown order too harsh and said that if the tanneries remained closed for three months, people would lose jobs and export revenue would also be hit. Earlier the tanneries were asked to only stop wet-end processing around important dates and that, he was reported to have said, could be a way out. Earlier on January 17 this year the state Cabinet amended the UP Municipal Corporation Act to take away the power of opening and running of slaughterhouses from civic bodies. A few days later Governor Ram Naik approved the state government’s decision to shift abattoirs outside city limits to effectively ban slaughter with city limits by signing the ordinance. Through another amendment, the government banned slaughtering of animals in any areas other than slaughterhouses “which would be opened”. Retail meat sellers were barred from slaughtering animals in their shops, except for religious purposes. Despite these amendments the ground situation has not changed. Though the municipal corporation was supposed to provide a mechanized slaughter house in Lucknow, it failed to deliver. As a consequence, the state capital itself is without a licensed slaughter house. The one which was operating at Moti Jheel locality was shut down in 2017 on the orders of the UP Pollution Control Board. With no authorised slaughter house in Lucknow and many other parts of the state and no new one having been opened as promised by the government, it is business as usual at meat shops operating in various localities. Animals are being slaughtered in shops in violation of government orders. While the continuance of the old practice has ensured regular meat supply, it speaks volumes about the unconcerned ways of the government’s working. The other aspect of the problem is voiced by meat exporters. Alarmed at the order to close down tanneries, the All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association’s (AIMLEA) spokesman Fauzan Alavi said it was a double whammy for them. “As it is the Central government charges 60 per cent duty, highest in the world, on export of hides and now the UP government was blocking access to domestic market by closing down tanneries for three months.” Explaining the situation, Alavi said, “With no work, the tanneries would not require hides, a perishable commodity. And, if they do buy it will be at much lower rates.” In a letter to  , the Union minister for commerce and industry, dated May 22, 2018, the AIMLEA stated, “The situation has now become grave with recent directive issued by Chief Minister, Uttar Pradesh, to close all tanneries in Kanpur from December 2018 to March 2019 before Ardh Kumbh Mela. This will directly affect buffalo meat export industries, which presently disposes hides to local tanneries in Kanpur and around, to stop operation and export. In order to save meat export abattoirs, it is requested that they be allowed to export hides generated from their plants which can only be done if the export of hides is exempted from 60 per cent export duty.” Alavi said that with UP being number one state in dairy production, about 70-75 per cent buffalo meat export was from UP. The letter pointed out that although the “buffalo meat sector is about USD 5 billion --- it had a negative growth of 14.41 per cent from 2014-15 to 2016-17--- it does not get any subsidy/incentive from the government”. On the other hand, the leather export sector, which is worth USD 7 billion, gets various subsidies with the total government outgo being Rs 3000 crore. The government which is expected to take a 360 degree view before arriving at any decision has preferred to adopt a knee-jerk approach starting with its March 2017 order to close down abattoirs, which it later clarified was against unlicenced slaughter houses. The industry hopes that it give thought to its concerns.  ",2018-06-21,, Saffron disguised as green: Why Yogi govt is targeting meat & leather industries | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/saffron-disguised-as-green-why-yogi-govt-is-targeting-meat-leather-industries-118973.html
247,Atul Chandra,"The Jewar greenfield airport project in Uttar Pradesh seems headed for turbulence. Farmers whose land in Gautam Buddh Nagar was marked for the airport alleged that the   (BJP) government is shortchanging them. To fast-track land acquisition, the Adityanath government on 28 May signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), Greater Noida and Noida. The airport was expected to be completed in 2022. For the first phase 1,500 hectares, is needed, for which six villages have been identified. Farmers were irked because just before the signing of the MoU, the government changed the land use of two villages from rural to urban. The two villages, Dayanatpur and Randhera, accounted for 900 ha, more than half of what is needed. Changing the land use status would reduce the compensation their owners would be eligible for. Compensation was pegged at four times the circle rate for rural land but only double the circle rate for urban land. Circle rate is the price of land fixed by the administration. It varies from one area of a district to another, depending on their deemed importance. Feeling duped by the government, farmers of all six villages have threatened to do a Bhatta Parsaul. Agitating farmers there had clashed violently with the administration over land acquisition during  's regime, leading to four deaths. At present, upset farmers held protest meetings from 28 May to June 2 and said they would not accept compensation. About 500-600 farmers from every village reportedly attended the meetings daily. While the district administration is said to have forwarded the farmers’ viewpoint to the state government, Dhirendra Singh, the BJP MLA from Jewar, said that he too apprised Adityanath of the simmering anger. As the social impact assessment was still on in these villages, he was hopeful his government won’t let the farmers down. Singh said the started 18 May, when the state government issued a notification imposing Section 12A of UP Industrial Act on 16 villages of Jewar, ending Panchayati Raj and declaring them urban. The timing of the land use change was unfair as farmers would get reduced compensation, he added. Farmers were paid four-times the circle rate for the land acquired for Eastern Peripheral Expressway, inaugurated by Prime Minister   a day before bye-elections to the Kairana Lok Sabha constituency. The area in contention is part of the same district, and Singh said he was finding it difficult to convince farmers to agree to the land use change at the start of the acquisition process. Singh, on the pillion of whose bike   rode to Bhatta Parsaul after the 2011 violence, found the situation especially embarrassing. He feared the project could be shifted to either Haryana or Rajasthan if the farmers decided not to yield. But why did the government decide to underpay farmers? One report said that the government did not have the Rs 4,000 crore it needed to pay in compensation. According to government sources, a total 3000 ha was required for the project, out of which 1,441 ha was needed for the initial phase. Denying a shortage of funds, a sources said the state’s civil aviation department would contribute Rs 1,500 crore from its budgetary allocation and the Noida Authority would match that. The Greater Noida Authority and YEIDA are to fund Rs 500 crore each.",2018-06-22,, UP Farmers suspect Adityanath govt wants to underpay them for Jewar airport land | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/up-farmers-suspect-adityanath-govt-wants-to-underpay-them-for-jewar-airport-land-119101.html
248,Akash Bisht,"Former Union minister Saifuddin Soz's upcoming book on   added to the ongoing political turmoil around Jammu and Kashmir. The   has attacked the veteran Congressman for being against 'national interest'. But then that is only to be expected from a party whose hardline stance on the state has been among its foundational blocks. The 'mainstream' media – especially its electronic avatar – also took its cue (not surprising really) and hounded the leader from Kashmir throughout the day. But what was more surprising than their hunger for TRP was the way the Grand Old Party of Indian politics buckled under pressure.  Not only did the   distanced itself from Soz's comment, but also pledged disciplinary action against the party. But for what? Did they find time to read what Soz wrote? Repeating, more or less, what he wrote, Soz told news agency ANI Friday morning: “(Pervez) Musharraf said Kashmiris don't want to merge with Pakistan; their first choice is independence. The statement was true then and remains true now. I say the same but I know that it is not possible.” The Congress and the media seems to have simply obliterated Soz's stress on “it is not possible”. The party high command does not seem to have sought a clarification from Soz or go through the contents of his book. Even more unfortunate, the Congress went to the extent of calling it a gimmick to drive sales. “We completely reject Soz’s statement. It’s a political gimmick to sell his book. Our J&K unit will take appropriate action against him,” party spokesperson RS Surjewala. For that matter, none of these going overboard in criticising Soz seems to have made any efforts to acquaint themselves with the contents of the volume. While the book is yet to be officially released, Catch has access to its contents, based on which it clearly offers glimpses of Kashmir's history. Starting from prehistoric times, it traces the journey of the region. Towards the end he talks about the peace process envisaged by Musharraf, and India's former prime ministers AB Vajpayee and  . He writes that Musharraf convinced the Pakistani brass, within and outside the Army, that the peace formula was the only possible solution that would not yield a situation on ground as a defeat for one party and victory for the other. “He had also convinced his colleagues that the resolutions of the UN on Kashmir had constituted a redundant situation as these meant a tight-jacket for Kashmiris whether they wanted to go with India or to Pakistan. Musharraf had explained that if Kashmiris were given a chance to exercise their free will, they would prefer to be independent. In fact, this assessment of Musharraf seems to be correct even today!” The Musharraf-Vajpayee-Manmohan formula included present borders but free movement across the region; autonomy on both sides and demilitarisation. It is a known fact that the root of all ills in Kashmir emanates from the strong feeling among its population of being independent from both India and Pakistan. In that context, what Soz said reflects the popular sentiment of the people of the state. If the media and Congress had gone through the content of the book, they would have realised how critical Soz is of the   (RSS) and how it has made no efforts to be a part of the solution. “It is an unfortunate situation that the RSS ideology and narrative on Kashmir has always created a problem and this organization has never tried to be a part of the solution. Recently, it has added a serious dimension to the already tense situation of unrest in Kashmir by approaching the Supreme Court for the revocation of Article 35A of the Constitution of India. It is the same article that protects various rights of people of the state,” Soz writes. Ironically, the BJP has made an issue of Soz's statements but has remained tight-lipped on multiple controversial and communal statements by its leaders. Whether it is the creation of a 'Hindu Rasthra' or sending minorities to Pakistan or taking away voting rights from Muslims, the saffron party has, in fact, shielded those making such statements. As far as the Congress is concerned, it should not let the media dictate how it responds to such situations. If it initiates disciplinary action against Soz, that can further alienate the party in the state, which is going through one of its most troubled times in the recent past. In the end, it would be about a book that talks about Herodotus' reference to Kashmir, Fa Hien's travels, Marco Polo's views, George Forster's account of its and several such accounts. Overall, the 248-page book offers great insights into the history of province and should not be solely judged on one statement and the unnecessary controversy surrounding it.",2018-06-22,, Problem isn't with Soz.

249,Rajeev Khanna,"  Crisis of leadership and Aam Aadmi Party ( ) continue to go hand in hand in Punjab. At the centre of the crisis now stands AAP's Sukhpal Singh Khaira who is the leader of Opposition in the state Assembly. He is in the eye of the storm over his support to the 'Referendum 2020' campaign of some Sikh hardliners on the issue of self determination. Although Khaira has tried to clarify that he is no votary of Sikhs seeking a separate homeland, he has underlined that issues related to the injustice to the community need to be addressed. While the storm over Khaira continues, the key question that comes to mind is that why has the top leadership in Punjab unable to survive for long without getting into a conflict with the organisational heads in Delhi and also in the state. In this case also reports say that the party's national convener and Delhi Chief Minister   refused to meet Khaira on Wednesday and the party's Punjab in-charge   also gave him a dressing down asking him to come clear on the issue. Earlier the party's co-president in Punjab Dr Balbir Singh along with others had come out with a statement saying the party directly or indirectly does not support 'Referendum 2020' and clarified that the party totally believe in the Constitution of India and integrity of country is utmost thing for it. The party does not support any activity against the unity and federal structure of the country. Commenting on Khaira's statement, the leaders said that it can be his personal view on the issue. They said that the party will seek clarification from Khaira on the issue and further underlined that the party will not hesitate to take action against the volunteers and leaders those have views against the Constitution of the country. The crisis in the party got further escalated with a large number of NRI units writing an open letter to Sisodia on the issue backing Khaira's stand. The letter reads, “As you might have seen his recent interviews about the referendum, he clearly mentioned again and again that he is an Indian, and he believes in the Constitution of this country but we need to introspect on what led to this situation that Sikhs are considering these actions. He raised the question which was for whole Sikh leadership, mainly Badals who have been in power in Punjab for so many years and falsely promised the justice to people again and again. It is very sad to see that instead of supporting Khaira’s question, our own leaders went against Khaira and started chaos on media openly against Khaira.” It further states, “We would like to inform you that we all are standing with Mr. Sukhpal Khaira on this issue. And, we are also very upset with Balbir Singh the way he handled the situation. He showed his immaturity to be a Punjab level leader first, by going against Khaira without knowing full situation and then even worse by putting Khaira’s personal phone number on social media.” This episode apart, one needs to ponder on why the top leadership of the party in Punjab has failed to sail smoothly for long. The list of the leaders at the top who had to pave way for others is pretty long in the small span of existence of the party in the state. These include names like Sumail Sidhu, Succha Singh Chhotepur, Gurpreet Singh Waraich aka Ghuggi etc. Two of the party's Lok Sabha MPs Dr Dharamvira Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa continue to remain suspended and even the Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann who was the star campaigner for Punjab resigned as the state unit chief a few months back. Many blame Kejriwal's style of functioning for this continuing trend. Prof. Manjit Singh who was among the founders of the party in Punjab and later parted ways told Catch, “ The party structure was never allowed to grow and there was never a distribution of power in the state. If that was done the Punjab unit would had a say in deciding at least 50 per cent of the contestants for the Punjab polls. Kejriwal is a NGO man and in NGOs the CEO is everything. He s running the political institution and party with an NGO experience. He has always allowed loose ends to remain so that he can prevail himself.” He said there is hardly any difference between Kejriwal and Prime Minister   when it comes to running their respective parties with an iron hand. “The authoritarian streak within democracy is dangerous,” he said. AAP had paid a big political price for allegedly hobnobbing with Sikh hardliners ahead of the Punjab polls as the party that once threatened to walk away with the winner's trophy was relegated to a distant second position. Many interpret Khaira's stand in this light. At the same time the over ambitious leaders scheming against each other also had a role to play in this electoral defeat. The party has refused to learn and this was evident from the recent controversy regarding an audio clip surfacing of a purported conversation between two party leaders on clipping Khaira’s wings. The clipping allegedly between party leaders Garry Birring and Sumit Yadav was about the role of Khaira in turmoil in the state unit, the support he gets from AAP MLAs and the need to cut him to size. This was reportedly followed by another audio containing some disparaging comments on the party MLAs. Balbir Singh had come out with a statement saying that a probe had been initiated into the matter. The letter written by the NRIs to Sisodia also touches upon the issue saying, “Few weeks ago, the audio recording of Garry Birring was leaked and was posted on social media. As you know the context of his call, where he was using very foul language against our MLAs, Khaira and other leaders, no action has been taken by the committee made by Mr. Balbir Singh. This is another example of Balbir Singh’s incapability for being Punjab co-convener.” The party remains in turmoil in Punjab. Something has to be done fast to put its house in order it it wants to repeat its performance of 2014 in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls next year.  ",2018-06-21,, Khaira gets both flak & praise: Why AAP in Punjab continues to remain in crisis | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/khaira-faces-both-flak-praise-why-aap-in-punjab-continues-to-remain-in-crisis-118974.html

In a series of tweets, Banerjee explained that she was “compelled” to cancel the visit at the last minute since the Chinese officials could not confirm her proposed meetings with key political leaders. Banerjee said, “India's ambassador in China intimated us that the political meetings at the appropriate level under the exchange programme could not be confirmed. Therefore, the purpose of my visit with a delegation to China is of no use.” Banerjee stated, “ In March this year, the Union Minister of External Affairs had recommended to me to consider leading a delegation to China in the coming months under the exchange program of the Government of India with the International Department of the Communist Party of China. In response, on 2 April, 2018, I accepted the recommendation to lead the delegation to China.” “In pursuance of the letters from Chief Secretary and the Ambassador of India in China, a programme was chalked out, based on which we planned our visit in the coming week,” she added. Even while expressing her inability to continue with the visit, she wished for the continuation of the friendship between India and China. West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said “ We waited till the last moment thinking that we will get a positive response from the Ministry of External Affairs, but ultimately MEA informed us today afternoon that Communist Party of China could not confirm the appropriate level meeting under the exchange programme and that’s why chief minister Mamata Banerjee has decided to cancel the plan to visit China.” Ma Zhanwu, Chinese consul general in Kolkata said, ""We have just heard that Banerjee has canceled her plan to visit China.

It may be mentioned that for the past few years a large number of business delegations from China have come to West Bengal to look after investment opportunities, especially in the field of manufacturing, fertilisers and food processing.

251,Rajeev Khanna,"  The continuing menace of illegal mining is proving to be the biggest bane of the Congress government led by Captain Amarinder Singh in Punjab. The recent developments point towards complete lawlessness that prevails in areas where illegal mining continues with impunity. Things reached a pinnacle with Aam Aadmi Party ( ) MLA from Ropar Amarjit Singh Sandoa being attacked along with his gunmen and personal assistant by around a dozen men during a visit to an 'illegal' mining site near Baihara village on Thursday. Sandoa had to be shifted to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical and Education Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh. This attack followed an assault on two forest department officials by the sand mafia barely two days ago. The mafia goons attacked block forest range officer Devinder Singh and forest guard Karnail Singh near Seonk village in Kharar on the periphery of Chandigarh on Monday night. Devinder was critically injured in the attack. In the case regarding the attack on AAP MLA, the main accused Ajvinder Singh has reportedly accused Sandoa of seeking graft. Whatever the case, the fact remains that those indulging in illegal mining stand emboldened and give two hoots to the state and its law and order machinery. These developments are a sad commentary on the state of affairs prevailing in Punjab. They reflect the government in a poor light and a large number of people are now saying that nothing has changed with regards to the sand mafia and things continue to be as bad as they were under the previous Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) –   (BJP) regime. Abolishing the sand mining mafia was one of the key promises that Amarinder had made to the people of the state in the run up to the Punjab assembly polls of 2017. But the message that is going out is that there is nothing called governance when it comes to dealing with the sand mafia. It was in March this year that Amarinder made headlines having had a first hand view of the illegal mining going on the banks of Satluj river while he was traveling by a chopper drawing smirk and sarcasm from the Opposition, political observers and the common people as they had been raising a noise on the menace for several months and the government had not bothered to do anything about it. Amarinder had ordered an immediate crackdown ordering a vigilance probe into the alleged nexus between top officials and the illegal mining mafia. He had asked the police and administrative heads in the districts to expand the ambit of their investigations to cover the owners and actual bidders of the mines, as well as the owners of the equipment used in cases of illegal mining. Instructing the officials not to brook any political interference Amarinder had said they should catch the owners and the bidders and not confine the action in illegal mining cases to merely the small fry, such as contractors and drivers. He had also announced the government’s decision to depute one Guardian of Governance (Rakha) at each mining site as a step towards curbing illegal mining. The officials too had come out with various suggestions to streamline and strengthen the mining processes. These included GPS tracking of the tippers, scientific demarcation of the mining sites with proper coordinates, besides installation of WiFi enabled CCTVs at all sensitive check points for monitoring the movement of the vehicles. Whatever happened to all these orders and suggestions. The result is for all to see in what has happened in the last five days. Following the assault on Sandoa, the chief minister has sought a detailed report and once again reiterated that lawlessness would not be tolerated under any circumstances. He has asked the Deputy Commissioner of the district to ensure a free and fair probe. He has asked the asked the state police chief Suresh Arora to crack down on the suspects and ensure their immediate arrest. The security personnel attached to the MLA have also come under Amarinder's scanner for evidently failing to protect him. Meanwhile, the Akalis while condemning the attack on Sandoa have demanded a judicial inquiry to understand the reason for the attack as videographic evidence from the site allegedly indicated that the attackers were AAP supporters who were protesting against forced extortion from the AAP legislator. SAD leader Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said any incident of violence against an elected representative is condemnable, but there should be a judicial inquiry into the incident as there was a visible protest from those indulging in sand mining that the MLA was continuously extorting money from them. “These persons have openly accused the MLA of asking for Rs 5 to Rs 10 lakh off and on while attacking him and thrashing his security personnel. These allegations are very serious in nature and should be verified immediately,” he added. AAP leadership has alleged that the attack shows that there is nothing called rule of law in Punjab. Party's co-president in Punjab Dr Balbir Singh said illegal mining was being carried at the site despite AAP leadership having got the activity canceled by the administration. He has announced a series of protests on the issue in the days to come. Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Sukhpal Singh Khaira said that the illegal mining in the state continues under the patronage of the state government and ministers and officials are involved in it. He later took twitter to carry his assault further. In one of his tweets he said, “While i strongly condemn the attack on Mla Ropar by mining mafia,it belies the claims of @capt_amarinder that there’s no illegal mining in PB! It’s also a litmus test of Cm whether he acts only to save Youth Cong leaders or can he ensure justice to Opposition n aam aadmi-khaira.” The general perception is that the sand mines are gold mines for politicians who make a quick buck from illegal sand mining. The Congress has failed to learn its lessons. It had suffered a major set back in January when Amarinder had to get his close confidant Rana Gurjit to put in his papers as power and irrigation minister eight months after his name figured in a sand mining scam. The government had recently junked a mining policy, prepared by local bodies minister   and instead asked the mining and geology minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria with framing the new policy. The 'foolproof' policy framed by Sidhu was on the lines of one being implemented in Telangana. Politically speaking, the Congress government under Amarinder cannot afford the lawlessness to continue in the poll year. It will have to convey to the people that is different from the previous regime and is keen to establish the rule of law. Above all it has to convey a seriousness for governance.  ",2018-06-22,, How illegal mining has become the biggest bane for Amarinder govt in Punjab | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/how-illegal-mining-has-become-the-biggest-bane-for-amarinder-govt-in-punjab-119114.html
252,Riyaz Wani,"  The talk of the BJP withdrawing support to the PDP started as a rumour in Kashmir, which was largely shrugged off. Nobody could imagine even in their wildest dreams that it would be the BJP which would abandon the coalition, considering alliance with the PDP had enabled it to become a ruling party in India's only Muslim majority state, a seemingly improbable prospect up until 2014. But when the news turned out to be true, it still took time to sink in. And then people started talking. Soon social media went abuzz with posts and memes and Whatsapp forwards began circulating. The dominant public mood that came to the fore wasn’t one of anger over the development but a sense of vicarious wish-fulfilment. An opinion poll run by a local daily showed 92 percent of the respondents approving the fall of the government. “The BJP-PDP rule will be remembered for just one thing – bloodshed. And for the disgraceful way   government has been dumped, Kashmiris are feeling this collective sense of schadenfreude,” wrote the noted Kashmiri cartoonist Suhail Naqshbandi on Twitter. Prominent activist Shehla Rashid wrote “the break-up was nothing but drama by the alliance partners to rid themselves of any accountability”. “They are fleeing, in order to escape questions from the public on nepotism & political/economic failures (sic),” Shehla said. Across the social media, the first few hours after the break-up of the coalition turned out to be a venting session for the accumulated mass contempt for the PDP, especially against its leader Mehbooba Mufti. Scores of memes, that started doing the rounds captured the catharsis in the Valley. One such meme went like this: “Mehbooba detergent: pehle istimal karein, phir vishwas naa karein (first use and then don’t even trust,” a variation on a famous jingle about a detergent. Both the posts and the memes played to the discourse that in withdrawal of the support by the BJP, the PDP had met a fitting comeuppance for its betrayal of the people’s mandate. “The pinnacle of curse is being ousted by the partner & then resigning from the chair of slayer,” wrote one Mohsen Shah. “If only she had such a heart to resign after the countless barbaric killings of the innocent youth during her genocidal regime”. Or this one: ""This is how New Delhi deals with its chaprasis (servants), always."" The alienation of the PDP is a huge fall for the Mehbooba, who could boast of the highest credibility among mainstream parties in the state, until her party decided to join hands with the BJP. A part of the anger now directed against her comes from a deep sense of betrayal of this trust. Killings and blindings in 2016 destroyed her popularity. As a result, BJP's withdrawal of support and the accompanying humiliation has become a sweet retribution. Hence, a reflexive response that exults in what is seen as “disgrace for the PDP”. This is a sentiment that was voiced even by the former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah in his interaction with reporters: “Wish Mehbooba had gone with her dignity intact rather than being shunted out by the partner (BJP).” Informed civil society opinion, on the other hand, sees the break-up as a long-anticipated end to an ideologically antithetical alliance. ""The alliance was doomed from the very beginning. The alliance partners were never gelled with each other. Prisoners of their respective ideological positions and constituencies, the two parties were in fact pushing the government in opposite directions,"" wrote the noted Jammu based academician Rekha Chaudhary. ""Except for the common goal to retain power, there was nothing common between the two partners. The differences were too profound and no effort was ever made to bridge them"". Rekha said the Agenda for Alliance, was ""a good document,"" with a ""potential of not only making the government work in the interest of the state, but also to resolve the inter-regional conflict in the long term"". ""But the agenda remained at the paper only. Lest they be seen as having compromised with their respective political positions, on the ground, each of the political partners was more aggressive about its ideology and therefore publicly confrontationist rather than conciliatory in approach"". For now Mehbooba Mufti is alone. Neither the Congress, nor the PDP see it worth their while to extend support. Her political standing is at its nadir. The BJP has called for “an all-out war” against the militants which is likely to result in more human rights abuses. But Mehbooba’s political capital has deteriorated to an extent whereby even if she starts making people-friendly noises, she can only expect ridicule in return. “PDP will soon start talking about the human rights of Kashmiris,” renowned Kashmiri writer Mirza Waheed wrote sarcastically on Facebook.  ",2018-06-21,," Far from being angry at BJP, Kashmiris are happy to see PDP humiliated | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/far-from-being-angry-at-bjp-kashmiris-are-happy-to-see-pdp-humiliated-118972.html
254,Rajeev Khanna,"                          A lot of heat and dust is being raised over the   (BJP) government in Maharashtra reportedly coming out with a series of illustrated books under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. In these books, Prime Minister   is featured alongside the famous comic book character Chacha Chaudhary. Modi is said to be assisting Chacha Chaudhary in his hilarious adventures. The move has drawn its expected political criticism with the BJP's political opponents slamming the saffron party for blatant misuse of power to promote Modi cult. But should we be surprised with such books being printed?  After all, there is nothing new in the right-wing efforts to provide Modi with a larger than life image, by creating myths around his persona. It has been very much a key component of the much promoted 'Gujarat Model' of governance. Modi has been given the title of Hindutva's poster boy right from the time when the Gujarat riots broke out. One need not go much deep into the past. Who can forget the 'Childhood Stories - Bal Narendra' book that made its appearance ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Those books focused on the early days of Modi's life eulogizing him for the prowess that he possessed. There were reported stories of Modi playing with baby crocodiles and swimming in a lake swarming with crocodiles to hoist a flag on top of a temple.",2018-05-31,, Why Modi's adventures with Chacha Chaudhary should not come as a surprise | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-modi-s-adventures-with-chacha-chaudhary-should-not-come-as-a-surprise-115658.html
255,Anurag Dey,"The BJP faced an embarrassing rout registering a solitary win as Assembly bye-poll results for 11 seats stretched across 10 states were declared on Thursday. While the Congress bagged 5 seats, the JMM 2, the RJD, CPI (M) and the   won one each. The bypoll/election in Assembly constituencies of Tharali (Uttarakhand), Shahkot (Punjab), Silli and Gomia (Jharkhand), Maheshtala (West Bengal), Ampati (Meghalaya), Jokihat (Bihar), Noorpur (Uttar Pradesh), Chengannur (Kerala), Palus-Kadegaon (Maharashtra) and Rajarajeshwari Nagar (Karnataka) were held on 28 May. Congress retained the seat when its nominee Vishwajeet P Kadam was elected unopposed following the pull out of rival candidates. The death of Vishwajeet’s father Patangrao Kadam had necessitated the by-poll.   which governs the state in alliance with the BJP, had given ""active support"" to the Congress candidate as a token of respect to his late father. Subsequently eight other candidates too pulled out, enabling Kadam win unopposed. The Congress enhanced its strength in the Karnataka Assembly to 79 after its candidate Muniratna retained the Rajarajeshwari Nagar Assembly seat. He defeated his nearest rival TM Gowda of the BJP by over 25,000 votes. The election to the constituency was deferred to 28 May following seizure of several thousand of fake voter cards stocked in an apartment, just days ahead of the Assembly elections on 12 May. Muniratna was named an accused in the case. Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, congratulated the Congress for the win said it will further boost the ruling Congress-JD(S) coalition in the state. Punjab’s ruling Congress registered an emphatic victory to wrest Shahkot Assembly seat from the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), a BJP ally. Congress’ Hardev Singh Ladi Sherowalia polled over 82,000 votes to trounce his nearest rival SAD’s Naib Singh Kohar by over 38,000 votes. Aam Aadmi Party’s Rattan Singh had to forfeit his security deposit. A stronghold of the SAD, Shahkot fell vacant following the death of SAD legislator and Kohar’s father Ajit Singh Kohar in February. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh hailed the victory of the seat which the SAD had retained for last 20 years. He said the voters favoured the policies of the Congress and rejected those of the Akali Dal. BJP’s only win in the Assembly by poll came in the Tharali seat in the hill state where its candidate Munni Devi Shah, defeated her nearest rival Jeetram of the Congress by over 1500 votes. With this win BJP tally in the state Assembly went back to 57. Munni Devi Shah is the widow of BJP’s Maganlal Shah whose death necessitated the by-poll. Giving a jolt to the ruling JD(U)-BJP in Bihar, the RJD led by Tejaswi Yadav wrested Jokihat assembly seat from Chief Minister  's party. RJD’s Shahnawaz Alam registered an emphatic win defeating Murshid Alam of the JD (U) by more than 40,000 votes. Jokihat seat in the Muslim dominated Araria district was won by JD(U) during the 2015 state elections. By-election to the seat was necessitated following the resignation of legislator Sarfaraz Alam who quit JD (U) and joined RJD. Now an MP from Araria, Alam the brother of Shahnawaz had quit JD U after Nitish Kumar dumped the grand alliance and go back to the NDA. In his reaction Tejaswi Yadav said victory was in fact people avenging Nitish Kumar’s “U turn”. ""The number of votes JDU got, is less than our victory margin,” said Yadav. Meanwhile, senior JDU leader KC Tyagi blamed the continuous rising fuel prices for the defeat. “There is outrage across the country due to increase in price of petrol & diesel. Constant rise in the price of fuel is also a reason for such poll results. Therefore, hike should be immediately rolled back,” ANI quoted Tyagi as saying. The Congress suffered a defeat in Kerala where the ruling CPI (M) retained the Chengannur seat with its candidate Saji Cherian registering a thumping victory. Cherian defeated D Vijayakumar of the Congress by over 20,000 votes. BJP’s P S Sreedharan was a distant third. By-election to the seat was necessitated following the death of CPI(M) MLA KK Ramchandran Nair. CPI (M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, said the victory was a “a reflection of the pro-people policies of our government”. “To counter the 'extreme Hindutva' of the RSS, Congress adopted a 'soft Hindutva' approach whereas our stand was firmly on secularism,"" he said. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the victory was people’s endorsement of the policies of the Left Democratic Front government. The Samajwadi Party (SP) wrested Uttar Pradesh's Noorpur Assembly seat from the ruling   (BJP). SP's Naeem-ul-Hasan defeated Avni Singh of the BJP by over 5,000n votes. The by-poll was necessitated on account of the death of then sitting BJP legislator Lokendra Singh in a road accident in February. While the BJP fielded Singh’s widow Avni with the hope of garnering sympathy of the voters, the gambit failed to take off against the opposition might which closed ranks in favour of the SP candidate. The loss is also perceived as another blow to BJP’s Hindutva poster boy and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath under whom the party has now lost three Lok Sabha seats and one Assembly seat. West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress predictably retained the Maheshtala Assembly seat but the surprise came in form of BJP displacing the CPI (M) to take the second spot. Trinamool’s Dulal Das drubbed his nearest rival BJP’s Sujit Kumar Ghosh byover 60,000 votes. Incidentally CPI-M nominee Pravat Chowdhury who came third was backed by the Congress. The by election was caused by the death of Trinamool’s legislator Kasturi Das. He had won the seat in the 2016 Assembly polls defeating CPI (M)'s Shamik Lahiri. The Opposition Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) retained both Silli and Gomia Assembly seats defeating All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) candidates. In Silli, JMM’s Seema Mahto defeated AJSU nominee and former deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto, in Gomia, JMM’s candidate Babita Devi defeated AJSU nominee Lambodar Mahto. The bye-polls were necessitated following the conviction of the JMM MLAs Yogendra Mahto and Amit Mahto in Gomia and Silli respectively. The Congress retained Ampati in Meghalaya with former chief minister Mukul Sangma’s daughter Miani D Shira emerging as the winner. With the victory Congress has now emerged as the single largest party with 21 seats in the 60 member Assembly. So far, the National People's Party or NPP-led alliance led by chief Minister Conrad Sangma, and the Congress, had 20 seats each. The bye-polls were necessitated after Mukul Sangma, who won both from Ampati and Songsak, vacated the seat.  ",2018-05-31,, Bye-poll meltdown: Results embarrass BJP as it faces reverses across India | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bye-poll-meltdown-results-embarrass-bjp-as-it-faces-reverses-across-india-115687.html
256,Aditya Menon,"Even though it does seem that Jats and Dalits voted for RLD's Hasan in large numbers, the alliance walked the tight-rope in managing the delicate balance between communities in Kairana. Hasan was kept away from Jat-dominated villages, where Jayant Chaudhary led the campaign. The RLD on the other hand did not focus as much no Muslim dominated villages, which were largely left to Hasan and her son Nahid Hasan, who is a Samajwadi Party MLA from Kairana. Akhilesh Yadav stayed of the campaign. Some say this was because Yadav's presence could have given BJP the chance to rake up the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots that took place under his tenure. True to form, the BJP did rake up the issue. During his election speech, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath repeatedly mentioned Sachin and Gaurav, two Jat boys who were killed in Muzaffarnagar in 2013. However, the Opposition should also be concerned that the transfer of votes wasn't as effective as it was in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls. In the 2017 Assembly polls, the combined vote share of Opposition parties in the 5 Assembly segments in Kairana was 19% more than that of the BJP. But Tabassum Hasan's margin of victory over Mriganka Singh was less than 10%. In Noorpur, the combined vote share of the SP, BSP, RLD and Congress was 16% in 2017. It has shrunk to about 5%. In Phulpur and Gorakhpur, SP-BSP led alliance's margin had increased between 2017 and 2018. The bad news for the BJP is that if the Opposition alliance remains united in the Lok Sabha polls and are able to transfer their votes effectively, the party could lose around 50 seats from Uttar Pradesh alone.At the expense of seeming over-optimistic, the Kairana bye-poll provides hints that Western Uttar Pradesh may have begun moving away from the politics of communal polarisation. During polling, in some places Jat women are reported to have made Muslim women to go ahead in the voting line as the latter were fasting for Ramzan. This was unthinkable in an area which witnessed ghastly communal riots five years ago. After the results, the victorious   candidate Tabssum Hasan spoke affectionately of her BJP rival Mriganka Singh saying, ""If I am a daughter-in-law of Kairana, but she is the daughter of Kairana"" after the latter congratulated her on her victory. Hasan defeated BJP's Singh by a margin of over 50,000 votes in a seat that was held by the latter's father Hukum Singh, until his death last year. In the bye-election to the Noorpur Assembly seat,  's Naim-ul-Hasan defeated BJP's Avani Singh by 6211 votes. Nothing seems to have worked for the BJP - neither Prime Minister  's roadshow and rally in Baghpat, barely 50 km away from Kairana, one day before polling; nor Chief Minister  's communal speeches, raking up the Muzaffarnagar riots, the fake Kairana exodus as well as the Jinnah portrait controversy. It is understandable why the BJP raised the stakes. It was paramount for the party to defeat the Opposition alliance in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The results show that the alliance's success in Gorakhpur and Phulpur earlier this year weren't by fluke and that a combined Opposition can defeat the BJP even in Western Uttar Pradesh, which the BJP had swept in 2014 riding on communal polarisation following the Muzaffarnagar riots. Getting non-Muslim voters to vote for Muslim candidates was supposed to be the biggest test for the Opposition alliance. They have passed this test with Muslim candidates emerging victorious in both Kairana and Noorpur. The victory is particularly significant for the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which was fighting for survival after being reduced to cipher in both the Lok Sabha and Assembly. RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary led the campaign in Kairana from the front, extensively touring Jat dominated villages in the constituency. ""This is a defeat of BJP's divisive politics. It is a defeat of communal issues they raised such as Jinnah and Kairana exodus,"" Chaudhary said, after Hasan's victory. Acknowledging the alliance, Chaudhary also congratulated to the parties which supported his candidate: SP,  , Congress, CPI-M and  . Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister  , who is one of the architects of the Opposition alliance, said that, ""Those in power have been defeated in their own laboratory. This is the defeat of their politics that is based on dividing the country. This is a victory of people who believe in peace and harmony. This is the beginning of the end of their (BJP's) arrogant power"".",2018-05-31,, BJP loses Kairana & Noorpur bye-polls: Why UP Grand Alliance is Modi's worst nightmare | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bjp-loses-kairana-noorpur-bye-polls-why-up-grand-alliance-is-modi-s-worst-nightmare-115678.html
257,Neeraj Thakur,"The victories of different Opposition parties in different states gives a clear message that personal ambitions and egos can be set aside in the face of looming existential crisis. The Congress, being the largest Opposition party led by example in Karnataka by offering chief ministership to HD Kumaraswamy of the Janata Dal (Secular) despite having double the seats than the latter. The BJP's dominance since 2014 scared not just the Opposition but also the BJP's own allies. One of the party's largest allies, Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party, walked out of the NDA coalition at the centre earlier this year, on the issue of special status for Andhra Pradesh. The other big ally, Shiv Sena, has been extremely critical of the BJP and it is likely that the party might also pull out of the alliance.     Since 2014,  BJP' has formed its government in 15 states, however, another - less emphasised - aspect in this political war is that the party has lost most of the bye-elections in these four years. This indicates that the Opposition has managed to pushback the Modi-  juggernaut to some extent. It also indicates that pre-poll alliances between anti-BJP parties give better results for the Opposition than fighting individually. Had the Congress and JD(S) tied up before the recently held Karnataka assembly elections, they would have avoided the jitters of losing their winning MLAs to the BJP. With every passing election, the anti-BJP parties are showing that the invincibility of Modi-Shah duo is more of a myth than reality. Yet, there are challenges trying to unite under the umbrella of secularism ahead of 2019 Loksabha elections. The most difficult and tactical call that awaits the anti-BJP parties is whether they should declare a PM candidate before elections or not. Because even if they unite to take on the BJP, it would be difficult for voters to support a faceless coalition against the larger-than-life figure of Modi. Another challenge for the anti-BJP parties would be to divide and decide the number of seats they want to fight on. For instance, the Congress may want to fight a large number of seats in Uttar Pradesh even though its performance outside Gandhi family bastions has been dismal. The 2019 Lok Sabha elections could still be anyone's game. But what the bye-election results have proven, is that the BJP can be made to bite the dust.  Those who called the unity of Opposition parties a pipe dream, had to eat humble pie on Thursday when BJP candidates were defeated in elections to 12 out of 15 Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies. The significance of these results can be gauged from the victory map of anti-BJP parties that covers the length and breadth of India. The first stop in the Opposition's victory march happens to be Uttar Pradesh's communally sensitive Lok Sabha constituency, Kairana, where rumours of mass Hindu exodus due to threats from Muslims made headlines two years ago. Later, the BJP MP, Hukum Singh who had made the claims of Hindu exodus had to retract from his statement. In Kairana, BJP' candidate (Hukum Singh's daughter) Mriganka Singh was defeated by   (RLD) candidate, Tabassum Hasan. Given the proximity of Kairana to Muzaffarnagar, the victory of a Muslim candidate from a party headed by a Jat leader Ajit Singh indicates improving Hindu-Muslim relations in the area and dominance of farmer's issues over those that divide the farmers into different communities. This line of argument is further corroborated by the fact that another Muslim candidate, Naim Ul Hasan of   won the Noorpur assembly bye-poll against BJP's Avni Singh in Uttar Pradesh. Moving east, in Bihar's Jokihat Assembly seat, Opposition party Rashtriya   (RJD) candidate Shahbawaz Alam defeated ruling Janata Dal-United (JD-U) leader Murshid Alam. In Jharkhand, Seema Devi and Babita Devi won from Silli and Gomia. Both candidates belong to Jharkhand Mukti Morch and were backed by the Congress. Down South, in Karnataka, Munirathna of Congress won the RR Nagar, giving the new Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition its first electoral victory. Though BJP had a face-saver in Maharashtra's Palghar Lok Sabha seat, where Rajendra Gavit defeated Shriniwas Wanga of the  . But BJP's Hemant Patle had to bite the dust IN Bhandara-Gondia seat, against NCP’s Madhukar Kukade. Vishwajeet Kadam of the Congress won unopposed from the Palus-Kadegaon Assembly seat in Maharashtra.  ",2018-05-31,, BJP decimated in bye-polls: Can Opposition stop the Modi juggernaut in 2019? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bjp-decimated-in-bye-polls-can-opposition-stop-the-modi-juggernaut-in-2019-115689.html
258,Rajeev Khanna,"  There are reports of a possible poll arrangement between the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) and the Congress, two sworn enemies till now, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. These reports have sent political pundits in a tizzy making them work on the pros and cons of this till now hypothetical idea. Reports say that not only in Delhi but this arrangement could extend to Punjab and Haryana as well. What would this mean for both these parties and why there is a compulsion emerging for such kind of a political tie up? The old adage of 'politics makes strange bedfellows' appears to justified in the present times. A simple answer for this comes from Professor Manjeet Singh who was among the founders of the phenomenon called AAP in Punjab and later left the ranks along with the senior leaders like Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav. He says, “The   (BJP) has brought things to a pass that whatever looked impossible till now is becoming possible. The ideological lines stand blurred and are fading fast. Who would have thought ahead of the recent Karnataka polls that   (Secular) and the Congress will have to swallow their pride and ego to join hands and form the government. The same is the case with the Bahujan Samaj Party ( ) and the   (SP) in Uttar Pradesh. Till sometime back there was hardly any probability of these two parties coming together.” In context of AAP and Congress, there have been reports in the media suggesting about talks between the two forces on a seat sharing arrangement of sorts in Delhi which the leaderships have denied. But the possibility is being examined from various angles. AAP insiders point out, “ If it comes to something like Kairana, Phulpur and Gorakhpur there might be an understanding where all the Opposition parties are coming together to field a common candidate against the BJP. Such kind of arrangement is possible but one cannot expect an alliance in the traditional political sense. For example when we look in Delhi, Congress leader Ajay Maken has been acting more like the BJP against AAP than the BJP itself. He was the one who seemed to be in a hurry to get 20 AAP MLAs disqualified. He has been the one who was appreciating the Lieutenant Governor for his anti-AAP measures.” They point out that with what face will AAP leaders face their supporters and cadres who have joined ranks to bring up a party that is a non-Congress non-BJP force if they go in for a political alliance in the traditional sense. In this case, the dynamics of Delhi will be very different from Punjab, the second state where AAP has a formidable presence. Political observers point out that in context of Punjab, the state leadership will have very little say in what the party's national leadership under Delhi Chief Minister   decides. It will simply have no choice before it. This has been evident from the fallout of the recent apology submitted by Kejriwal to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikramjit Singh Majithia over the allegations made with regards to the drug menace. The state leadership made a noise which eventually fizzled out. There has been churning on the issue of an arrangement with the Congress. There are reports of senior AAP leader HS Phoolka opposing such a move. It is understandable in his case where his personal convictions overwhelmingly overrides the interest of the party. Phoolka has played a pivotal role in fighting cases against the Congress leaders in Delhi for their alleged involvement in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. His career and public image has been built on these cases. At the same time reports say that AAP's leader of Opposition in the Punjab assembly Sukhpal Singh Khaira of not being opposed to such a move. But political statements apart, AAP would not be opposed to such an idea given the fact that it has fared badly in every election after its rout in the 2017 assembly polls and it stands in a disarray in Punjab. Its voter base has shifted towards Congress in these elections and it would be more than happy if it is able to retain the four Lok Sabha seats it won in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls through some kind of arrangement. “In Punjab the people had hope but are disillusioned. We have to accept that AAP in Punjab today is either a luxury or a nostalgia. It is not that the people are happy with the Congress but the resentment against the Akali-BJP combine stays and they are left with no choice. With so many fence sitters there can be a repeat of Shahkot across the state,” says Manjeet. The Shahkot bye-poll results a couple of days ago show that almost the entire AAP vote base shifted towards the Congress. It is being underlined that he fence sitters would be more inclined to vote for an arrangement with the Congress as they would be sure that at leas they would not be facing any harassment and there would be a contentment that their vote has not gone waste. In Haryana, things are much different. AAP is yet to make a start here and is not in a condition to bargain for seats. The party has been trying to get a foothold, at least in the areas around Delhi, by selling its Delhi model of governance. On the other hand the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), one of the three main political forces along with the Congress and the BJP, has already announced a pre-poll pact with he BSP. It needs to be pointed that the Congress and the INLD have been the traditional rivals in the state and the BJP is a newcomer. What would be most interesting is that apart from a possible AAP–Congress tie up whether the INLD, Congress and the BSP too can come together. It remains a remote possibility at present but then nothing can be ruled out in the present political circumstances across the country.  ",2018-06-02,, Strange bed-fellows: Can AAP and Congress join hands ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/strange-bed-fellows-can-aap-and-congress-join-hands-ahead-of-2019-lok-sabha-polls-116022.html
259,Rajeev Khanna,"The results of the Shahkot Assembly bye-poll are set to redefine the political equations in Punjab ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. They point to certain deep-rooted changes that have taken place in the state polity in a short span since the 2017 Assembly polls and these changes are set to have a major role in how things unfold in about 10 months from now when the Lok Sabha polls are held. To begin with, these results are a further pointer to the phenomenon of the state fast moving back to a bipolar polity. At this point, the Congress with a resounding win in Shahkot stands as the dominant pole while the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) emerging as the second pole although on a weak wicket at present. The Aam Aadmi Party ( ), which is at present the main Opposition party in the state Assembly, continues to slide fast into oblivion with another humiliating defeat. One just needs to look at the figures that have emerged after the Shahkot results. The victorious Congress candidate Hardev Singh Laddi Sherowalia polled 82,745 votes, which is far more than the 42,008 votes secured by the party in the 2017 assembly polls in this Akali stronghold. Akali candidate Naib Singh Kohar who was banking on sympathy after his father and ex-minister Ajit Singh Kohar’s death that had led to the bye-poll. But he could poll 43,994 votes that is 2,969 votes fewer than the party's tally in 2017. But the biggest surprise has been the dismal performance of AAP candidate Rattan Singh Kakkar Kalan who could just poll 1900 votes as against 42,008 that thee party candidate had polled in 2017.  The mathematics signals that the AAP vote shifted totally towards the Congress.  Now what does this mean for each party? Let's begin with AAP. This defeat is an addition to the series of poor performances that the party has come up with after its rout in the state Assembly elections. The cadre in the state stands disillusioned and demoralised even as its leadership still continues to grapple with issues of autonomy for the Punjab unit. Many describe AAP in Punjab to be a classic case of a party letting down a massive support base of common people where over ambitious leaders faltered at the last hurdle in the race to the finish in the state Assembly polls. After all, the party was threatening to form the government in the state at one point of time. The people had ensured victory for its candidates on four of the 13 Lok Sabha seats and giving others substantial number of votes. Does this mean that it is time for AAP to pack up its bags? The party will have to take some radical measures if it wants to retain its four seats or increase its tally, both of which remain far fetched at this point of time. It will have to redraw its blueprint for the state. All that its co-president Balbir Singh could say after the Shahkot debacle is that the party will discuss with the volunteers and office bearers to find out what went wrong against it. He said the party will try hard to shun the mistakes made in the past and said that new plans and strategies will be made to reach out the voters at booth level. For the SAD which is in alliance with the   (BJP), the loss in its stronghold comes as a disappointment as its tally has got further reduced to just 14 seats out of 117. The BJP has three members in the assembly. But SAD President Sukhbir Badal carried out a good campaign for the bye-polls making sure that the narrative against the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress is well crafted. Ever since the Assembly polls, it is Sukhbir-led Akalis who have been acting as the main Opposition party because of AAP being in disarray. On majority of issues, mainly the Panthic ones, the face-off has primarily been between the Akalis and the Congress. Sukhbir took potshots at AAP saying, “The state of AAP can be measured from the fact that it did not even open its account in many villages. It has ceased to exist as a political entity in Punjab.” He claimed that the Shahkot election was fought in trying circumstances with the Congress government riding roughshod over all democratic principles to use excise, sales tax, panchayat and electricity board officials besides the police force to intimidate voters. He said despite this the SAD put up a good fight and there was a groundswell of support in its favour. He said the result was however not commensurate with this effort because civil and police officials toed the Congress line and even election code violations like entry of illegal liquor in trucks into the constituency were overlooked. “We will force the Congress government to fulfill the promises made to the people of Punjab and will not let them run away with excuses,” he added. The BJP continues to stand on the margins of state politics. With its support bank of small Hindu traders having shifted towards the Congress after the demonetisation introduced by Prime Minister   which was followed by shoddy implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the party has failed to reclaim its support base. The attitude and treatment of its central leadership, particularly the fountainhead of RSS, towards minorities has led to even the Sikh supporters of Akalis being miffed with the party. Observers are of the view that the Akalis would have nothing to lose if they walk out of the alliance with the BJP as the latter remains confined to small Hindu pockets in urban Punjab. Dalits, particularly of Doaba, that had supported it at one point of time also feel alienated after the Supreme Court's alleged dilution of the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. It needs to be underlined that Punjab has around 32 per cent Dalit voters For the Congress, the winning spree continues despite the public perception at large that the government remains far from an ideal state of functioning and Amarinder is not taking keen interest in presenting forward a model of governance for the Congress to showcase in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. But still it is a resounding victory because Sherowalia's campaign had started on a negative note with a case being registered against him for alleged illegal mining. The people chose to ignore these charges. It remains to be seen how Amarinder leads the charge for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.",2018-06-01,, Shahkot bye-poll results: Is Punjab going back to a bipolar polity? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/shahkot-bye-poll-results-is-punjab-going-back-to-a-bipolar-polity-115860.html
260,Atul Chandra,"  Losing one Assembly and three Lok Sabha bye-elections, including one in his own constituency Gorakhpur, has dented  ’s image as a political strategist, if he ever had one. Being a strong votary of Hindutva, Adityanath’s strategy during his years as an MP has been to grab votes using strident Hindutva. He was catapulted to the high office of Uttar Pradesh chief minister precisely for that reason. His being the reigning head of Nath sect with a huge following was an added qualification. For this reason the BJP decided to use him as its star campaigner wherever elections were held---Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, North-east and even the recent bye-election in Maharashtra's Palghar. His brief apparently was to raise the pitch of Hindutva in order to polarise voters. His success in Gujarat and Karnataka Assembly elections is questionable. However, he is said to have helped woo North Indian voters in Palghar and his Nath card had some success in Tripura earlier this year. But it is his Hindutva card which doesn't seem to be working. Adityanath’s sole claim to fame being inflammatory speeches and the Gorakhnath temple’s priesthood, he relied heavily on these two factors in Karnataka. In one of his election rallies he described the Congress as a party with “jihadi mindset”. In Sagar, Adityanath raised the issue of beef, cow slaughter and accused the Congress government of shielding jihadis. He even asked people to choose between Hanuman Jayanti and Tipu Sultan jayanti. His campaign included visits to temples and meetings with heads of various mutts. At Balenhour near Chikmagalur Adityanath met Veera Someshwara Swami of Rambhapuri mutt and discussed cattle conservation with seer Raghaveshwara Bharathi of Ramchandrapura mutt. In coastal Karnataka Prime Minister   and Adityanath both campaigned extensively but when results came, all the credit for BJP’s increased tally of seats was given to Adityanath. The results present a different picture. While the prime minister addressed 21 rallies, Adityanath addressed 17. In all, the two leaders campaigned in 36 constituencies but the outcome was far from satisfactory as BJP gained 11, lost two and retained six of these seats. The net gain, therefore, was of nine seats only. Of the 11 new seats seven were in the coastal belt where Adityanath campaigned extensively. But so did the PM. So, is it fair to give the entire credit for the party’s performance in the southern state to Adityanath? Neither Modi nor Adityanath’s mojo seemed to have worked in Belgaum where the two-time BJP MP Sanjay Patil, who notoriously said that this election was between Hindus and Muslims, lost by a huge margin. Yet it was claimed with gusto that Adityanath had done wonders for the BJP in Karnataka elections. The chief minister persisted with his divisive tactics also in Kairana and Noorpur when he equated ganna (sugarcane) with Jinnah and came a cropper. With sugarcane farmers fuming over their pending arrears of over 12,000 crores, ganna prevailed. In the Thana Bhawan constituency of BJP MLA Suresh Rana, who is also the sugarcane minister, the party got 77,080 votes against 92, 239 votes polled by the Opposition candidate. With Rana having been involved in Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013, voters also seem to have rejected politics of polarisation. The recent losses in the bye-polls are not only a setback to his future prospects in national politics, but they also set tongues wagging about his future as UP CM. Amidst talk of shake-up the state party bosses and ministers have been summoned to Delhi. Adityanath has not only failed to cast his spell on voters his performance as chief minister too has been disappointing. A few days back B.Ed qualified teachers staged a protest in Lucknow demanding that they be provided jobs as directed by the Supreme Court. The teachers had taken all necessary permissions from the district administration for their rally yet when they headed towards Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath they were severely lathi-charged. What aggrieved the teachers more was the apathetic attitude of the basic education department’s principal secretary who, despite the CM’s instruction, adopted delaying tactics in resolving the issue. This was not an isolated case of the CM’s instructions being ignored by the highly corrupt bureaucracy of Uttar Pradesh. Nor is it the only problem with governance in the state. A   MLA wanting to meet the CM was content with meeting a secretary in his department because, as he said, “Yogiji hardly has time to listen.” In any case, the MLA said, he would have referred the file to the secretary with whom he was sitting. Adityanath’s style of functioning, which is more like that of a temple priest, has made him a failed administrator. In his avatar as head priest he could still get a lot of his work done through his militia, the Hindu Yuva Vahini but handling bureaucracy is a different ball game. His constant absence from the state capital due to campaign duties did not help matters either. The BJP is now aware that strident Hindutva notwithstanding, Adityanath was going to be its weak link in 2019. One can now hear the refrain that 2019 will be Modi’s chemistry versus the rest. With talks of BJP numbers in 2019 slipping to 25 from 73 in UP, Adityanath’s neck is on the block. The UP chief minister may turn to Hindu Yuva Vahini and virulent communalism once again to bolster his sagging fortune. The Vahini is said to have got into the act soon after the Kairana defeat by trying to give the result a communal hue. The victorious candidate Tabassum Hasan of the RLD has accused the Vahini of spreading fake quotes in her name. Several pro-Hindutva individuals and groups on social media were circulating fake news that Tabassum Hasan said that “Allah had won over Ram in the bye-elections”.",2018-06-02,, Bye-poll fallout: Has Yogi Adityanath become a liability for the BJP? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bye-poll-fallout-has-yogi-adityanath-become-a-liability-for-the-bjp-116033.html
261,Neeraj Thakur,"  When a government begins to realise that it does not have an answer to the country's problems, its leaders simply begin to negate and mock the existence of all issues that affect people. This had begun to happen with the UPA in last three years of its rule. The government simply failed to recognise the country's anger against rising inflation, increasing corruption and crony capitalism. It was natural that people ousted the   government in 2014. But the NDA has reached that stage in four years, despite coming to power with the promise of setting right what the UPA had allegedly done wrong. At a time when farmers across the country are finding it difficult to make two ends meet, Union Agriculture minister Radhamohan Singh, instead of addressing their problems, chose to make a ridiculous statement. “They don't have any issue; they are just focusing on unnecessary things through this strike. Not selling produce will bring losses to the farmers only,” said Union agriculture minister at an event in Patna to mark the 4th anniversary of the Modi government. He further said that farmers' protests were only for media attention. Farmers in India have had a tough time under the Modi government in the last 4 years. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, farm sector grew at -0.25 and 1.1% respectively due to back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the rain god did not disappoint farmers, but the government did. There was a bumper crop in 2016-17 but farmers in states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana saw the price of pulses crash, thanks to a silly decision to flood the Indian markets with imports from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi. Some say that the decision ended up benefiting certain corporate houses. But since not every farmer grows pulses, many were saved from the harrowing experience of realising less then their input cost on the produce in a good crop season. The government was reprieved by farmers' associations, experts as well as opposition for punishing the farmers in a good crop year. But the decision of importing pulses in a good crop year would have affected a few thousand farmers. For the rest, government had even bigger plans. In November 2016, just ahead of the Kharif season, Prime Minister   took a horrendous decision to demonetise 86% of country's currency, destroying each and every farmer with one stroke. Due to cash shortage, vegetables and other farm product prices crashed by more than 30% taking away all the resilience of the farmers that saves them during bad times. Cow politics made selling cattle in cattle markets difficult for farmers and this also resulted in diminished incomes of marginal farmers who rely on livestock to supplement their incomes. It was only after three years of drought and bad government policies that the farmers came together and began protesting on roads. They were not in a position to repay their debt and demanded loan waiver from the government. Since, it was due to bad policies of the Union government that the farmers were under financial distress, there should have been no questions asked on the need of the farm loan waiver by the central government. But the Centre refused to help and put the onus of bailing out distressed farmers on respective state governments. Since states have limited resources, the waivers were designed to help only a section of those demanding it. Finance Minister   had promised to double farm incomes by 2022. Far from doubling it, the government policies have forced farmers to protest against the government in a way that is self-destructive (as suggested by the Union agriculture minister). But instead of calling it foolish and stage-managed, the government should see the writing on the wall. The results in Kairana bye-poll could well be the reference point for India's agriculture minister as the Opposition's “ganna” (sugarcane) plank emerged victorious over the BJP's Jinnah controversy.  ",2018-06-02,, Farmer protests: Radhamohan Singh's silly statement shows govt can't solve agrarian distress | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/farmer-protests-radhamohan-singh-s-silly-statement-shows-govt-can-t-solve-agrarian-distress-116037.html
262,Ashwin Aghor,"The bye-elections for Lok Sabha held last week have given a clear message: the   (BJP) and   are not invincible. The Opposition has tasted blood and are raring to go all guns blazing for the 2019 general elections. The defeat is being seen as beginning of the end of Modi wave, if at all there was anything like it. Out of the two Lok Sabha by-polls in Maharashtra, BJP retained one and lost another to the Congress–Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) alliance. The outcome of the Lok Sabha bye-polls is an eye opener for BJP on many counts. Though the party leadership is patting its own back for retaining the Palghar Lok Sabha seat, the humiliating defeat at Bhandara – Gondia seat has come as a major blow. While Opposition parties have started believing that the Mega Alliance is the perfect answer to Narendra Modi and BJP, some are still sceptical about it. “Though it is a good indication that a united Opposition can defeat BJP, we are not sure if the performance can be repeated in the 2019 general elections. The biggest hurdle in 2019 would be lack of a face for the post of Prime Minister, which, every partner could accept. Though the victories in recent bye-polls are no less important, it cannot translate in majority in 2019 elections,” said a senior Congress leader who did not wish to be named. Manisha Kayande, spokesperson of   feels that though Shiv Sena couldn’t win the Palghar elections, it has shown its mettle by increasing its vote share. During the 2014 general elections, Shiv Sena polled a total of 1,82,343 votes. It has considerably increased to 2,43,210 votes in the bye-polls held on 28 May. Whereas the vote share of BJP in Palghar Lok Sabha constituency came down to 2,72,782 from 5,33,201 in 2014, a decline of 2,60,419 votes. Similarly, the vote share of the Congress, has gone up sharply as compared to 2014. Congress leader Sachin Shingda who contested as an independent, had polled just 7,957 votes in 2014. But in the bye-polls, his father Damodar Shingda 47,714 votes as the Congress candidate. The CPI-M saw a minor decline in vote share. The party candidate had polled 76,890 votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, while this time around, the party candidate got 71,887 votes. Similarly, the vote share of Bahujan Vikas Aaghadi, a local political outfit, too, dropped by 70,000 votes. “This is a clear indication that Shiv Sena is growing rapidly. The betrayal by BJP on almost every count is the main cause that voters are leaning towards Shiv Sena,” Kayande said. According to her, Shiv Sena has already begun its journey to become the strong alternative to BJP in Maharashtra and this will be evident in days to come. Reacting to future of the Mega Alliance and its performance, she said, “People will stand behind the Mega Alliance if they get a strong alternative. The Mega Alliance will get stronger gradually.” Shiv Sena will join the Mega Alliance if invited by the members, she added. Congress spokesperson Sachin Savant, however, is confident of defeating the BJP in the 2019 general elections. “Given the successive defeats of BJP in the bye-polls, we are confident of defeating it even in 2019,” he said. Reacting to the question on acute difference of ideologies among the members of Mega Alliance, Savant said, “It is remarkable that all the Opposition parties have come together to fight the BJP. The sole aim is to remove Modi from power. The fact that parties like   (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party ( ) came together is indicator of the commitment of the Opposition to remove Modi from power. As far as issue of seat sharing and PM Candidate is concerned, it would be resolved amicably. “The task at hand is to protect national interest which is to uproot BJP from power. Party interests are secondary at this moment. BJP has been a big failure on all the counts. Parties like SP and BSP coming together shows the failure of Modi,” he said. When asked about Shiv Sena’s willingness to join Mega Alliance, Savant sharply reacted saying, “Aligning with Shiv Sena is out of question. We cannot even think of it.” “It is too early to predict that the Modi wave has dissipated. It has been observed so many times that the ruling party loses by-polls. Hence they cannot be any yardstick for the 2019 general elections,” says veteran journalist and political analyst Ganesh Torsekar. “Remember it was Modi, who propelled BJP to number one in Karnataka. Had Modi lost his winning charm, Congress would not have surrendered to JD(S) and gave away the post of CM,” Torsekar added. Though Shiv Sena is preparing to part ways with the BJP in the forthcoming elections, there is a divide among party MLAs and MPs on the issue. Many of the MLAs are not happy with the decision. “It will be a disaster for the party if there's no alliance with the BJP. Contesting elections independently will mean our MPs will be reduced to single digits, from 18 at present. We can also suffer major losses in Assembly elections,” said a senior Shiv Sena leader who did not wish to be named. He also ruled out the possibility of joining the Mega Alliance as the Congress is dead against Shiv Sena. “The so called Mega Alliance can work in Maharashtra only if Shiv Sena is part of it. Congress, NCP and other parties combined, cannot make any difference. The situation will change only if Shiv Sena is on their side. And given the ideological difference between Congress and Shiv Sena it seems to be a distant possibility. It will reflect badly on Shiv Sena and can lead to large scale discontent among its cadres,” Torsekar said.",2018-06-04,, Maharashtra: Why Sena and Congress-NCP feel they can defeat BJP in 2019 | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/maharashtra-why-sena-and-congress-ncp-feel-they-can-defeat-bjp-in-2019-116292.html
263,Anurag Dey,"“The Modi government doesn’t believe in any dialogue with unions, does not honour bipartite and tripartite mechanisms and considers labour laws and trade unions as hindrance to growth and development. “For this government, “ease of doing businesses”, is meant only to curtail workers’ rights, which is being pursued by changing labour laws. The claim is simplification, but the motive is to make it punitive for workforce and its unions and providing liberty of hire and fire to employers with no accountability,” said AITUC General Secretary Amarjeet Kaur The AITUC also said a strike in the coal sector was imminent in protest against opening up of commercial coal mining for private sector. “The AITUC is in talks with other central trade unions over the issue. The scope of discussion has also been left open for the BMS which has expressed its willingness to join our action. The government has not bothered to listen our repeated pleas and now there is no other way but to go for strike action. A massive strike in the coal sector is now imminent,” said AITUC President Ramendra Kumar. He said the strike call may be given early July. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Modi in February cleared the opening up of commercial coal mining for Indian and foreign companies in the private sector. While the government described the move as the “most ambitious reform of the sector since its nationalisation in 1973”, trade unions have been vehemently opposing it. The central trade unions had called for a day-long strike on 16 April against the move, but was deferred following “lack of cohesion” between the unions.  The BMS has been opposed to the privatisation of the coal mining sector but refused to be a part of the 16 April strike.  It said it was willing to hold discussions with other trade unions over the issue and take a call on the strike action only after that. Flaying the Modi government’s policies, the AITUC said the Indian economy was being handed over to corporates and MNCs. “Tacit support is being extended to communal outfits in spreading hatred and communal poison to divide the society and to distract people’s attention from real issues of livelihood, education, health, shelter and social security, etc.,” it said. Citing Labour Bureau figures, the central trade union said the 25 % percent of country’s population between the age of 10-29 years will experience unemployment rate of 34 % by 2022. “Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) has put unemployment rate in urban areas at 8.2 %. In another report, India topped with 8.8 % unemployment rate among south Asian nations,” said the trade union.The   government has been facing the wrath of workers with trade unions vehemently opposing its moves. The resistance is now all set to intensify with the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) announcing launching a nationwide campaign seeking ouster of the BJP led regime at the Centre. The AITUC’s 40 day campaign beginning August 9, is aimed at exposing the “anti-worker and anti-people” policies of the Modi government and build up a mass movement for the ouster of the BJP regime. Trade unions have been up in arms against the Modi government which, soon after coming to power in 2014, began initiating reforms in various sector including allowing 100 % FDI, amending industrial and labour laws curtailing workers’ rights. Besides staging a three-day mass strike against the policies of the central government in November 2017, central trade unions held a protest march in the national capital in March this year. Central trade unions also observed a one-day strike of all ‘scheme workers’ working under various government schemes in January 2018 demanding minimum wages and social security benefits.  The BMS which is affiliated to the   (RSS)-- the ideological fountainhead of the BJP-- has also been vociferous in criticising Modi government’s “anti-worker” stand particularly its labour and industrial policies. The central trade unions had demanded rollback of the facility of hiring workers on fixed term employment that was extended to all sectors by the Modi led Centre in March. The provision was earlier  only in the apparel manufacturing sector.  BMS president CK Saji Narayanan, who had earlier   the Modi government as an “extension of the previous Congress-led UPA”, had recently expressed objection to the government’s move to codify and merge labour laws. Following BMS’ objections, BJP chief   held talks with the trade union leaders to assure that changes in labour laws and reforms will be made only after proper consultations with trade unions. Incidentally BMS which has been accusing the Modi government of undermining tripartite mechanism, also asserted that Shah has assured of “special efforts” to strengthen tripartite mechanism to settle labour issues. While the BMS is happy about its discussions with the BJP chief, the AITUC is planning to intensify its movement against the Modi regime.  ",2018-06-04,, Trade unions' war with BJP continues: AITUC to launch 'Oust Modi' campaign | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/trade-unions-war-with-bjp-continues-aituc-to-launch-oust-modi-campaign-116305.html
264,Rajeev Khanna,"  's (BJP) national president   was in Chandigarh on Thursday meeting the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leadership as a part of his outreach initiative towards the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) allies ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He participated in a meeting attended by around 25 leaders of both the parties including the Akali patriarch and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. For both these parties, particularly the BJP at this point of time, continuing this alliance seems to be more of a compulsion. For the Akalis, the continuing attraction in carrying on with this alliance is the of course being a part of an alliance that is in power along with a coveted union cabinet berth for Harsimrat Kaur Badal who is the wife of the party president Sukhbir Badal and daughter in law of Parkash Singh Badal. Otherwise, the Akalis have not been able to extract much from the   led BJP government at the Centre. Modi failed to give any special package to Punjab ahead of the 2017 state Assembly polls that could have helped the SAD-BJP combine come up with a better performance instead of the pounding they received at the hands of the Congress and even the rookie Aam Aadmi Party ( ). Any intervention by the Centre in terms of an agriculture package or an industrial one would have boosted their chances. In fact, the Akalis are bearing the brunt of the people for the activities of the Sangh Parivar. Apart from the heat they have been facing along with the BJP over the demonetisation carried out by Modi and the shoddy implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) that even did not spare the institution of Langar, it is the RSS meddling in the Sikh affairs that has the masses annoyed with both the Akalis as well as the BJP. The perception among a large section of Sikhs is that the RSS has managed to infiltrate into institutions like the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) through the Akalis and is distorting Sikh history. There was a furore over the Rashtriya Sikh Sangat which is said to be a Sangh Parivar affiliate organising an event in Delhi to mark the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh and more recently over a series of books being printed in Nagpur in Hindi on Sikh history with 'blasphemous' content that are being circulated across India. Though the Akalis have not said so in open, their leaders have been miffed at the Akali leadership being cold shouldered by Modi and his team on various occasions. They have not been seen campaigning in states where the BJP returned victorious in the last two years and neither were they on the dais during the investiture ceremonies. There was also discontent over Modi and Shah not addressing many public rallies ahead of the Assembly polls. Coming to the BJP, the party's alliance with the Akalis has been a loss making enterprise over the last few years. The party had to pay for the anti-incumbency of the Akalis in the last state elections and its tally got reduced to a mere three seats of the 23 it contested. The slide has been massive given the fact that the party had won 19 of these 23 seats in 2007. The same is the case in case of Lok Sabha members. From three seats that it contests as an Akali ally, the party is presently representing only the Hoshiarpur seat through Vijay Sampla. It had earlier won the all important Amritsar seat which was taken away by Captain Amarinder Singh of the Congress who dealt a crushing defeat to   who was fielded instead of the winning horse   in 2014. The party also lost its stronghold of Gurdaspur in last year's by-poll that had resulted from the demise of  . In the by-poll Sunil Jakhar of the Congress defeated Swaran Salaria of the BJP by a very huge margin of almost two lakh votes. Although there have been murmurs of discontent from the BJP ranks to go all alone in various polls in Punjab, the party leadership has stuck to the alliance. Many BJP workers as well as leaders believe that the party will have go out alone if it wants to expand its base in Punjab. But the leadership knows very well that the party organization is limited to a few urban pockets only. The party which is perceived to cater largely to the interests of the Hindu population cannot sustain in rural Punjab without Akalis as its ally. Besides the BJP suffered a major blow ahead of the 2017 assembly polls when small traders who were its traditional support base moved towards the Congress after taking a beating from the demonetisation carried out by Modi. The party has since then been trying to woo them back, but in vain. In addition to this is the ideological line of the RSS that claims that its alliance with the Akalis has helped promote national sentiment in this border state dominated by a religious minority. The Akalis have the distinction of being the oldest regional force in India and among the first allies of the BJP in India. There are reports that the BJP wants to swap Jalandhar parliamentary seat with Hoshiarpur in accordance with the coalition formula. It is being felt that Sampla will be more comfortable contesting from Jalandhar that has more urban voters as compared to Hoshiarpur. Secondly, Jalandhar is the home turf of Sampla. The Akalis would obviously want the central government to come out with some major initiatives to address the concern of the farmers ahead of the Lok Sabha polls as this would help them take credit and approach their key support base in rural Punjab. This is the first interaction between Shah and Akalis as a part of the Shah's ally outreach programme. Many more expected in the days to come as the SAD-BJP combine would be desperate to rise from the drubbing of the 2017 state Assembly polls. “We discussed planning to be done and strategy to be worked on for the elections. I want to say that the SAD is a permanent ally of the BJP and a member of the NDA, There are no differences and conflicts between us. I want to call upon the other NDA allies that the time for the battle has come and they should forget their differences, if any, and come together,” said Sukhbir Badal after the meeting.  ",2018-06-07,, Amit Shah meets Badal: Why Akalis and BJP have no choice but to stick together | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/amit-shah-meets-badal-why-akalis-and-bjp-have-no-choice-but-to-stick-together-116839.html
265,Rajeev Khanna,"  Aam Aadmi Party ( ) has started flexing its muscles in Haryana, keeping in mind the Lok Sabha and state Assembly polls that are to be held back to back next year. It has announced its decision to contest all the ten Lok Sabha and 90 assembly seats while selling its Delhi model of governance to the people of the state. But the moot question is whether it has the capacity to take on the well-established Congress, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and   (BJP) in the state where it is just a new kid on the block. AAP's Haryana in-charge Navin Jaihind has announced a “Haryana Jodo Abhiyan' from 10 June aiming to enroll one lakh workers within the next two months. He has made no bones about taking the Delhi government's report card to the people of Haryana and placing it against the performance of the traditional political forces who have been in power in the state. “The people of Haryana should ask these political parties that if results of government schools in Delhi are better than private schools, why children enrolled in Haryana's government schools fare badly ? If the Delhi government can provide good healthcare in its Mohalla Clinics and government hospitals free of cost what stopped these parties from doing so in Haryana over the last 52 years when the state was created ? If Delhi government can give power at Rs 2 per unit why has Haryana been charging Rs 8 per unit?” he has questioned. The party has also been attacking the central government under BJP on not delivering on its poll promises of 2014, particularly on issues pertaining to the farmers that are going to form the core of the political narrative in the days to come in this primarily rural state. Observers point out that having formed the government in Delhi and done well in Punjab during the 'Modi wave' of 2014 which was followed with the party having almost made it in the state assembly polls, AAP is bound by many reasons to expand its base in Haryana, a state that lies sandwiched between Delhi and Punjab. The party has a window of opportunity here that help its expansion plans. Reports point to the two visits by AAP's national convener   to the state in the last couple of month that were marked by impressive rallies and roadshows. There is a noise about AAP's Rajya Sabha member and former Punjab in-charge Sanjay Singh being asked to play a greater role in Haryana. AAP had contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls on all the ten seats and some of its candidates were well known faces like Yogendra Yadav and Navin Jaihind. But the party had fared miserably. Now with people like Yadav having left the party, it is facing a crisis of leadership where it needs popular leaders with a mass base. “In Punjab there were people like Dr Dharamvira Gandhi, Bhagwant Mann etc. ahead of the 2014 polls while there were those like Sukhpal Khaira and HS Phoolka available ahead of the state Assembly polls. Such a scenario is not there in Haryana,” pointed a political observer. “Yet it is a sort of political compulsion to contest the polls. AAP gained nothing by contesting the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and refraining from the Assembly contest except for having saved some money. The people who constitute a party's support base just get scattered and go with other parties when their own party does not contest. In addition to this Kejriwal himself is a son of the soil. A large number of his MLAs and ministers also have roots in Haryana,” he added. Besides AAP's new Rajya Sabha MPs ND Gupta and Sushil Gupta also have their roots in Bhiwani and Jind respectively. They can play a role in propping up the party in the state. Interestingly, Jaihind, Kejriwal, ND Gupta and Sushil Gupta are all Baniyas from Haryana. If AAP expands in this section, it will directly eat into the vote bank of the BJP. Observers further point out that even at this point of time AAP remains a late starter in the race for Haryana as all the other three parties have been off the starting block for quite sometime having carried out at least one round of public outreach. “The party stands a chance in making its presence felt in areas around Delhi where it has the advantage of the spill over impact of governance in the national capital. With a fluid political situation being witnessed in the state right now who knows that it might get to play the king maker even with six to eight seats if it manages to win them. It might become the power of the fringe that can dictate the formation of the next government in the state,” said another political observer. In a recent interview to  , Kejriwal has pointed, “AAP has evolved from a social movement. Haryana has a political vacuum of credible parties. The ruling BJP government in Haryana has been fanning communal and casteist sentiments. People have also seen the INLD and the Congress. Unlike the much-hyped ‘Gujarat model’ slogan of the BJP, we invite people to compare Delhi’s three-tier public health and improved transportation system. Power rates in Delhi are the cheapest in the country. Haryana is among the states with most expensive electricity rates.” It is being pointed that the Delhi unit of the party will have to put its entire weight behind the party's Haryana leadership in terms of man power and other resources if positive results are to be derived from the state.

266,Charu Kartikeya,"  Over a week has elapsed since the airing of the Cobrapost sting operation videos and any kind of logical follow-up from any authority whatsoever is still missing. Since journalists largely abhor intervention by governments, there were expectations that bodies tasked with self-regulation will respond and tackle the issue with the seriousness it deserves. The Editors' Guild of India is one such body and its much-delayed response came on 3 June, a full eight days after the expose. The statement left much to be desired. Expressing 'concern' over the claims made by Cobrapost through the sting operation, the Guild merely urged media organisations to explain their position. The statement quite clearly showed the Guild's lack of confidence in the sting and the issues it raised, by adding a   at the outset that “the Guild cannot ascertain the veracity of these tapes”.   Significantly, the statement carries a strong note of disapproval of sting operations, per se, terming them as “misrepresentation or subterfuge”. It is not clear whether the act is deliberate or unintentional, but the statement has played down a small but significant rider that is mentioned towards the end. Sting operations are justified when they are conducted in public interest, says the proviso. Is it anybody's case that the issue highlighted by the sting is not in public interest? The operation has caught the top honcho of the world's largest selling English-language daily, among others, admit on video that he is ready to accept crores in cash for publishing communal content that will benefit a particular political party. This is media corruption of the highest order and the public interest in it is undeniable. It is probably a measure of the complete erosion of public faith in the media that that there is hardly any outrage over this in the country right now. In any responsible democracy, such revelations would have invited a probe by investigative agencies right away. The Guild has possibly tried to take advantage of this absence of outrage by going soft on those caught red-handed and instead reprimanding Cobrapost for conducting the sting. The statement is a dishonest attempt at addressing the issue. Cobrapost Editor Aniruddha Behal told Catch he found the statement shallow and in bad taste. Talking about questions on the ethics of sting operations, he said “this was neither the time nor the occasion to take potshots at hidden camera investigation”. A veteran journalist Catch spoke to also pointed out a series of flaws with the Guild's statement. It is a case of too little, too late, admitting that it was disappointing that the statement was focused on the ethics of hidden camera investigation and almost entirely silent on what it revealed. Siddharth Varadarajan, Editor of The Wire, has already   out that “editors are not judges presiding over trials who disallow improperly obtained information as evidence” Varadarajan has rightly recalled that when Channel 4 aired the results of the Cambridge Analytica sting operation, all major news organisation in India covered the operation in detail without any qualms. The veteran journalist also noted that he didn't find the Guild's statement very surprising because “editors at the top of the pecking order come to share the same perspective as the owners and their marketing managers”. Another journalist who has seen the Guild function for years said this kind of approach was the result of the organisation not being truly representative of journalists at large. She said there was no proper election or membership to the organisation and that in the past, not even 10-12 retired editors used to turn up for the Guild's meetings. As the statutory body that governs the conduct of print media in India, the Press Council of India could have taken note of the videos. An FIR could have been lodged and a police probe could have been launched. As the controlling ministry of the nation's premier investigative agency, the Home Ministry could have directed a probe. The courts could have also taken suo moto cognisance and directed a probe. However, in the absence of any action on these fronts, media could have risen to the occasion and called for a probe. The Editors Guild's soft statement is failure of the Indian media's self-regulation mechanisms. The issues raised by the Cobrapost sting operation are of paramount significance to the neutrality of Indian media and public faith in it. They must not be allowed to die without due investigation.  ",2018-06-05,, Why Editors' Guild statement on Cobrapost sting-op is a major let down | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-editors-guild-statement-on-cobrapost-sting-op-is-a-major-let-down-116478.html
267,Ashwin Aghor,"Dalit acivist and a member of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly Jignesh Mevani called the arrests an “attack on Ambedkarite movement”.  The People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) condemned the arrests of (those) “who have been active in various movements and organisations, and have publicly defended the rights of Dalits and various sections of marginalised people.” Mihir Desai, on behalf of the civil rights organisation, said: “The simultaneous arrests at different places in the country, by state authorities, smack of predetermined planned attack on people who have been protesting against injustice and atrocities perpetuated by various state and non-state Hindu right-wing groups.” He called the arrests a “blatant violation of citizen’s rights to freedom of expression and voicing dissent... a move to target individuals working for rights of the marginalised sections of society, and to produce a chilling effect on voices of dissent.” Veteran poet Sambhaji Bhagat said: “All those arrested are highly sensitive about human rights and have been working for it since many years now.” The battle of Bhima-Koregaon, fought on 1 January 1818, gained prominence after BR Ambedkar visited its site on the anniversary day in 1927. An obelisk there, listing the names of Dalit soldiers of the British East India company who fell in battle fighting Peshwa forces, has ever since become a symbol of solidarity. Dalits have thronged the site on New Year's Days since then to mark Ambedkar's visit. This New Year's Day was the 200th anniversary of the battle and thousands gathered at the Pune village on 31 December-1 January to commemorate the the Mahar regiment's achievement. However, things soon took a violent turn, with incidents of arson and stone-pelting being reported from Bhima-Koregaon and adjoining villages. One person died and several were injured. There was an ensuing Dalit backlash and Maharashtra bandh on 3 January. The impact was felt up to Maharashtra's capital Mumbai as well. An first information report was lodged on a complaint by Tushar Damgude at Pune's Vishrambaug police station against Dhavale, Sagar Gorkhe, Harshali Potdar, Ramesh Gaychor, Deepak Dengle and Jyoti Jagtap. Sections 153 (provocations for riot), 505 1B (causing fear, inducing violence), 117 (abetment) and 34 (criminal act by several persons) of the Indian Penal Code were used. The Pune Police also filed an FIR against Mevani “an inflammatory speech” at Elgar Parishad. Dhawale is the state president of a co-ordination committee formed for the Parishad. The Devendra Fadnavis government earlier appointed a two-member committee to probe the violence. Activists of troubadour group Kabir Kala Manch were booked and organisers and speakers at Elgar Parishad were accused of delivering provocative speech. The cops also filed FIRs on complaints by Dalit activists against Hindutva activists Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote for “inciting violence”. Ekbote was arrested, but is out on bail.  PUCL's Desai pointed out that the duo faced several complaints and FIRs. “These two pro-Hindutva leaders have a history of allegations for causing communal and caste tensions, rioting.” They allegedly desecrated the memorial of a Dalit icon in Pune on 29 December, 2017, he said. “The Supreme Court even denied anticipatory bail to Ekbote,” his statement added. “Both have deep links with the   and are clearly being protected by the ruling dispensation,” he alleged. On the ground, while Bhide and Ekbote roam free, Dalit activists now bear the brunt. Those arrested today have even been termed “Naxalites” – the Indian government establishment's umbrella term for those from the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). According to Desai, this has become a standard protocol. According to him, under the garb of countering “Naxalites”, democratic protests are labeled unlawful, protestors are incarcerated for years and subsequently released when the State fails to prove its case. ""The whole purpose is to crush any protest against injustice, deny people their basic citizenship rights, deprive them of their basic means of livelihood,” he said. Citing the example of Wednesday he said a prejudicial narrative that those arrested are “Maoist sympathisers” or “top Maoist operatives” was underway in mainstream media. “The current situation in the state and country can only be termed as an unannounced emergency. The government has unleashed atrocities against those who don't approve of its ideology,” Bhagat said. “It did not even touch Bhide, who openly applauded Manu Smriti. On the contrary, innocent people are being harassed,” he added. “Oppression of the innocent, claiming they are Naxals will only alienate them … It is high time that the Opposition and Dalit parties like BRP Bahujan Mahasangh came together and took a firm stand against it,” he said. According to Republican Panther President Sumedh Jadhav: “The government is after Dalit activists ever since Elgar Parishad. Dhavale and Prakash Ambedkar successfully exposed the government. The Parishad infused enthusiasm among Dalits and now the government wants to keep dedicated, hard-working activists under pressure until the next elections.”The Bhima-Koregaon case took a strange twist Wednesday when Maharashtra Police arrested five prominent activists under the much-panned Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, alleging they were “Naxalites”. This drew sharp criticism from Dalit leaders and the civil society. The Pune Police arrested Dalit activist Sudhir Dhawale from Mumbai. Activists Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, and lawyer Surendra Gadling were arrested from Nagpur while Rona Wilson was picked up from Delhi. They arrests were for alleged hate speeches and distributing “controversial” pamphlets. Offences were registered against some of these activists, including Dhawale, in January itself after the violence broke out at the turn of the year in Bhima-Koregaon. It was alleged that their inflammatory speeches at Elgar Parishad. The Elgar Parishad was organised by Dalit activists and intellectuals on 31 December last near Shaniwarwada in Pune. “We have been working on gathering evidence to make a strong case,” a senior police officer said from Pune. The police claims are sure to be hotly contested though.",2018-06-06,," Activists slam Fadnavis govt, cops after arrest of Dhawale and others for Bhima-Koregaon violence | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/activists-slam-fadnavis-govt-cops-after-arrest-of-dhawale-and-others-for-bhima-koregaon-violence-116659.html
268,Charu Kartikeya,"How long before even the President's office falls in line, Catch News had asked last   The occasion was the BJP's unannounced boycott of then President  's iftar on 23 June, 2017. The Prime Minister's Office had stopped hosting iftar parties after   became PM in 2014. President Mukherjee continued to host iftar parties but Modi never attended them. Till 2016, some Union ministers did oblige attend these parties at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, but even they abstained in 2017. Mukherjee's last iftar party on Raisina Hill essentially saw a total boycott by not just his own government but the entire governing party. His successor   has completed the process set in motion by Modi by discontinuing the Rashtrapati Bhavan's tradition of hosting iftar parties. Kovind's press secretary Ashok Malik has said that after Kovind took office in July 2017, “he directed Rashtrapati Bhavan being a public building there would be no religious observances at taxpayer expense. This is in keeping with the principles of a secular state and applies to all festivities, irrespective of religion”. nion Minister Giriraj Singh was more honest on this front. He told reporters last year in no unclear terms that iftar parties were “drama” and asked those hosting them whether they will host similar gatherings for Hindus? Even if we dismiss Singh's views as his own and not an explanation of Kovind's decision, the secularism argument that the latter has put forth is not convincing. After all, the organisation that he is a product of, the RSS, uses religion as means of capturing state power. Even as his press secretary is vouching in the name of secularism, Kovind has, in his 11 months in office, made it a point to publicise every temple visit of his. Be it Somnath Temple in Gujarat, Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh, Kamakhya Temple in Assam or Brahma Temple in Pushkar, he has visited many temples in his official capacity. What is more significant is that every time he visits a temple, his office makes sure to release a photograph of his visit. These photographs, most commonly, show him offering prayers inside temple premises, in the presence of priests. As an individual, Kovind is free to visit any place of worship in the country, but as President, releasing photographs makes it a public act. Do the “principles of a secular state”, as mentioned by Malik, apply only to the Rashtrapati Bhavan and not the Rashtrapati himself? While you ponder over that question, take a look at these pictures of Kovind visiting temples across the country, which the photo gallery on the President's website is full of.  ",2018-06-07,, An ode to President Ram Nath Kovind's secularism: His much-publicised temple visits | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/an-ode-to-president-ram-nath-kovind-s-secularism-his-much-publicised-temple-visits-116843.html
269,Rajeev Khanna,"The arrest of Sudhir Dhawale, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Rona Wilson and Mahesh Raut in the Bhima-Koregaon case by Maharashtra Police under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, has stunned the civil society. They have been termed as 'urban' or just plain Naxalites for the ever gullible self-styled nationalists and their arrest would form a part of the political debates where nationalism is the flavour. Whether the allegations against them stand the scrutiny of law remains to be seen as the matter unfolds in the courts but one needs to ponder how and why these people are considered to be outlaws by the ruling dispensation. Of those arrested, this writer had an opportunity to interact with Dhawale apart from meeting him when he was in Punjab to participate in a civil society initiative to discuss the possibility of the coming together of the Left and Dalit forces in the country. It was during the course of interaction that this reporter realised that people like Dhawale are the ones who are capable of mobilising the marginalized communities on a large scale in small mofussil towns and villages where some of the most gruesome atrocities are recorded. They are the ones who give a direction and voice to the victims who are quite often illiterate or semi literate at the most. They are the ones organising movements where top Dalit leaders like  , Ram Vilas Paswan or even the likes of Udit Raj are never to be seen. They are people who do not mince words when asked direct uncomfortable questions and are candid in their response. In short they are not politicians but plain activists. During the interaction, Dhawale who represented Republican Panthers Jati Vinash ka Andolan had given a copy of a bilingual journal 'Vidroh' that he was bringing out. The cover had carried the words 'Kisi ke Baap ka Hindustan Thode hi hai' and this was enough to gauge that he stood for a society that is inclusive. He was candid in saying that he was a part of an initiative since the Khairlanji massacre of 2006 where four Dalits were killed allegedly by the members of the dominant Kunbi caste in Bhandara district of Maharashtra in 2006. This initiative aimed at bringing together radical Left activists and Ambedkarites for the common cause of social justice. “We believe that the atrocities cannot be removed by the state machinery and the Dalits need to stand up for themselves. Dalit movements have been continuing on the ground especially against atrocities especially in small towns and cities. You do not get to know about them because the mainstream media never reaches there. It is also true that it is not in a planned manner,” he said. He pointed that since the so-called Dalit parties fail to provide them the leadership whenever there is an attack on the Dalits, the people are left with no choice other than taking to the streets in the name of Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar. He was of the view that the Dalit issues in India eventually boil down to issues of class and that is why Ambedkar did not only talk about the identity and respect of Dalits but also took forward the issues related to the farmers and labourers. “His approach was also radical. Ambedkar experimented with the parliamentary politics and was instrumental in drafting thee constitution but he could not give it the shape of an instrument of state socialism because the drafting committee again was dominated by the landed castes and capitalists. He could not get the Hindu Code Bill passed and returned to the path of struggle,” he pointed. Dhawale pointed that the shortcoming of Left in India is that while it talks of the proletariat, it fails to address the issues of the caste of the proletariat in the villages. He was of the view that since the issues of caste and class are to be addressed together, the Left forces and the Ambedkarites need to work in tandem simultaneously. “If the Left talks of the proletariat revolution, the proletariat in the villages is mostly Dalit. That is why the squads of the extreme left or Naxalites were first constituted in the villages and they took shelter there. Their base was among the Dalits and they led the fight on the issue of Dalit self-esteem and land rights. Dalits also rose in the ranks of Naxal groups and if someone has given a befitting reply to the upper caste militia in India like Ranveer Sena it is the Naxalites,” he explained. “We are not talking about bringing together the Marxist and Ambedkarite ideology. They are different streams of philosophy. But they can join hands for public good,” Dhawale underlined. He had a different take on the RSS working among the Dalits on one hand to lure them and the increasing attacks on Dalits in thee name of cow vigilantism and religion particularly in the state ruled by the   (BJP). “This is the double face of theirs. They want a vote bank but do not want to address the economic concerns of this vote bank. If you do not want to address their concerns you need to bring in the issues of cow and religion. They need Dalits to act as their militia,” he said. On the issue of no major Dalit leader emerging at pan India level, he said that this is because of the diversity of the country. But at the same time he pointed that local agitations and movements have thrown up leaders like Jignesh Mevani, Prashanth Dontha and Chandrashekhar Azad 'Ravan'. Dhawale's book on the 'institutional murder' of Rohith Vemula made waves. He said that slogans like 'Jai Bhim Lal Salam' should not be election oriented. The Left that leads on issues on economy needs to lead on issues of caste also. Dhawale had got a rousing response to his address at Mansa which is seen as a cradle off the Left in Punjab where issues of Dalit identity and strategy of the Left was discussed threadbare. Dhawale remains behind bars but the issues that he raised remain very much alive in the public domain.",2018-06-08,, Why activists like Sudhir Dhawale are seen as a threat by the BJP govt | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-activists-like-sudhir-dhawale-are-seen-as-a-threat-by-the-bjp-govt-117033.html
270,Charu Kartikeya,"Even as twitter is roasting the PM-assassination-plot theory and its proponents, it is important to note that the way this narrative is being built is exactly how state propaganda works. At first, the state turns a blind eye to allegations leveled against its agents. When the heat begins to rise, a campaign is unleashed to reverse the narrative. Opponents of the regime are hunted, barely-provable evidence is produced from thin air and is labeled incriminating. The state and its agencies do not wait for public acceptance of the narrative which is swiftly moving from one conclusion to the next. The complainants are eventually branded as enemies of the state, making it easy for the law to swoop down on them and for the state to manufacture public disapproval. Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote, leaders of radical Hindutva outfits, are accused of instigating large-scale violence during a Dalit congregation in Pune’s Bhima-Koregaon on January 1 and 2 this year. The violence killed one man, besides injuring several others. While Ekbote was arrested but is now out on bail, Bhide continues to be unreachable for the fabled long arm of the law. Meanwhile, an entire bunch of activists dedicated to fighting battles for Dalits and tribals is arrested. A letter is produced, purportedly recovered from the laptop of the one of the accused. The prosecution lawyer reads out the letter in court after which, only the ruling party's spokespersons get access to it. They read it out on TV and publish excerpts on social media. The letter talks about Maoists and openly mentions information about their plans, meetings, funding as well as criminal projects. Those arrested are also promptly labeled Maoists. Even before you can come to terms with that, the narrative changes once again. The alleged Maoists, it is explained, could have been out to kill the prime minister! Boom, everything changes. Because the narrative is moving very fast, it is hard for people to pause and reflect. Questions fade into oblivion and propaganda takes over. Behind the arrests by Pune Police and the facts that have been put forth since then are a series of questions that have not been satisfactorily addressed. Take a look at these - FIR in January, raids in April, arrests in June – None of the five arrested so far were named in the original FIR, lodged in January 2018. Firstly, Police is yet to explain what led to the probe zeroing down on them. Secondly, what explains the three-month delay in the raids and then again the two-month delay in arrests?  – The only 'incriminating' evidence that the police and prosecution team have furnished so far are two letters which they claim are Maoist communication. While the contents of the letters have been made public, police is yet to reveal even details like what has been done to establish their authenticity? Are unauthenticated letters incriminating enough to allow police to make arrests?  – The contents of these letters coupled with the manner in which they are being bandied about have created an air of incredulity about them. Does one expect underground organisations to be so casual about using open letters and entirely un-coded language to talk about things like funds, weapons, meetings, strategy and a plot as dark as assassination of the prime minister?  – BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra had been able to access the first of these letters on just the day after the arrests were made. Waving the letter during his press conference, he arrived at convenient political conclusions, making wild allegations. Even as hearings on the case were going on, Patra had given his and his party's judgment. If this doesn't smack of conspiracy, what does?  – The genesis of the entire episode has now receded to the background. The violence in Bhima-Koregaon is not being talked about now. The focus of discourse is a purported plot to kill Prime Minister  , the objective being to help his government and his party gain public sympathy.

271,Charu Kartikeya,"The Congress party, however, took no exception to Mukherjee's musings and noted, instead, that he showed the 'mirror of truth' to the RSS at its own headquarters.   This was a sharp U-turn from the consternation that several Congress leaders had expressed so far. Apart from Mukherjee's daughter Sharmishtha Mukherjee and senior leader Anand Sharma, no less than Ahmed Patel, long believed to be the voice of   herself, had rebuked the former president for accepting the invite. Did the Congress do this to kill the impression that the event had generated that it was the RSS who was having the last laugh? At the end of the day, the Nagpur-based organisation whose political arm calls for a Congress-free India did succeed in getting a former Congress patriarch of sorts to visit its headquarters and praise its founder with folded hands in front of his statue.  If there was a purpose behind former President   accepting to be the chief guest at the RSS headquarters in Nagpur, it wasn't revealed today. There was no new idea in Mukherjee's speech if you consider the general mood of the speeches he has given since he was jettisoned into the role of a statesman, as President of India. A brief history of India with a stress on 5000 years of the country's 'civilisational continuity' and the country's constitutional values has been the hallmark of his speeches in the last 6 years. He merely reiterated these aspects in Nagpur too and in doing so, hardly made any departure from his views known so far. This kind of content was barely enough to decode whether he gave the RSS a message or not. Sure, there was renewed stress on diversity, secularism, plurality and 'constitutional patriotism', but there is nothing new in his exposition of these ideas. Many, including Mukherjee's own daughter, had already highlighted that his acceptance of the RSS' invitation was a statement in itself. The spectacle of the man who was once a towering Congressman now visiting RSS headquarters and addressing pracharaks was itself damaging for the Congress. It gave RSS legitimacy, they said, thus belittling the 130-year old legacy of the Congress party. Many others, however, were of the opinion that merely Mukherjee's act of visiting RSS headquarters should not be looked at in isolation. It will be important to see what he says there, they said. The former president did make a departure, though, from his views known so far. He separately visited the birthplace of the founder of RSS, K B Hedgewar and wrote in the visitor's book, ""Today I came here to pay my respect and homage to a great son of Mother India"". Never before has the RSS founder received that kind of a praise from a Congressman. There were other points too that invited sharp reactions from several quarters. CPI(M) General Secretary,  , said asserted that Mukherjee refraining from mentioning “Mahatma Gandhi and his assassination speaks volumes”.        ",2018-06-07,," Pranab flummoxes all at RSS headquarters: Praises Hedgewar, stresses on secularism  | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/pranab-flummoxes-all-at-rss-headquarters-praises-hedgewar-stresses-on-secularism-116850.html
272,Anurag Dey,"While the  's (BJP) drubbing in the recent bye-elections suggests its strong middle-class constituency maybe moving away party President   has asserted the contrary, saying it continues to enjoy the support of all the sections of society. Addressing a media conference in Chhattisgarh’s Ambikapur, Shah also claimed the state under the BJP rule has long shed its image of a “BIMARU” state and was now among the league of developed states of the country. “If the middle class had gone away from us, we wouldn’t have won so many elections. It is a misinformation being spread by the opposition,” Shah replied to a media query on whether the middle class was getting alienated. “There are a lot of schemes aimed at the middle class, we wouldn’t have been in power in so many states if all the classes of the society had not supported us,” said Shah. Shah’s assertions come in the wake of BJP drubbing in the recent by-polls where it lost 12 of the 15 Lok Sabha/Assembly constituencies where polls were held. A united opposition also wrested the crucial   seat in Uttar Pradesh and the   seat in Maharashtra from the BJP. Already disenchanted by the mediocre Union budgets, the middle class is said to be getting away from the BJP especially in the wake of skyrocketing fuel prices.  Besides, traders considered to be BJP’s core voters, have also been getting alienated with the unnecessarily complex rollout of the GST. On the issue of fuel prices, Shah said the government was working on lowering the prices. “Fuel prices have been cut down steadily, the government is equally concerned and working to bring them down more,” he said. He also negated Opposition charges of the country’s border being insecure. “In the last four years, it is the BJP government’s achievement that the most number of terrorists have been killed. Not just our borders are secure but India has a prestigious place in the world. “When (former Prime Minister  ) used to go on a foreign trip hardly anyone would know about it. But when PM Modi goes to any country in the world, he is welcomed by all,” said Shah. Asserting that the BJP will come to retain power in the state for the fourth consecutive time, Shah claimed the   government has doled out large amounts of central funds to Chhattisgarh to contribute towards its progress and development. “Shedding the tag of a “BIMARU” state, Chhattisgarh has now made it among the developed states of the country. Thanks to the Raman Singh government in the state and the Modi government at the Centre, Chhattisgarh is now a hub of development. “From being a power surplus state, to bringing Naxals under leash, from hike in agricultural production to rice to every poor and health to every household to telecom services even in the remotest of areas, I can go on listing the development work of the Raman Singh government,” said Shah. Shah also enumerated various Central schemes under which funds have been granted to the state and asserted the party’s mission of winning 65 seats in the upcoming assembly polls. Earlier, addressing a rally in the state on Sunday, Shah had affirmed that the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and reservation system in jobs will remain in force till the BJP is in power. Campaigning for the party, Shah alleged that the Congress would use the  upcoming assembly polls to spread ""lies"" about the Modi government being “anti-reservation”. ""The Congress will spread different types of lies to mislead people. They will say the SC/ST Act is being abolished, they will say the reservation is being scrapped. “I want to clearly say that the SC/ST Act and reservation will remain in force till the BJP government is in power,"" he added.",2018-06-11,, Everybody says we are fine: Amit Shah in Chhattisgarh | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/everybody-says-we-are-fine-amit-shah-in-chhattisgarh-117438.html
273,Atul Chandra,"Prime Minister  ’s most telling photograph that comes to mind is from 2011 when he refused to wear a skull cap offered by a cleric in Gujarat. It was inconceivable then that one day mosque visits would form an essential part of Modi’s itinerary during his tour to Muslim nations. In Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Oman and more recently Indonesia and Singapore, he visited famous mosques and even agreed to wear a green religious chador without a fuss. These were either diplomatic compulsions or meant to tell Muslims in India that he was not averse to accepting them. Muslims were more amused than convinced with the apparent transformation in the PM as he is yet to visit any mosque in India and his party persists with its policy of dividing the society on communal lines and prepares accordingly for the 2019 elections. Modi is now scheduled to visit Maghar, the place of nirvana of 15th century mystic poet Kabir, in the Sant Kabir Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh on June 28 to lay the foundation stone of Sant Kabir Academy. Unlike the   (BJP) and its leaders who advocate religious divide, Kabir was a secularist extraordinaire who preached through his verses that Ram and Rahim reside in one’s heart and was against muezzin’s daily call to worshippers or noisy invocations to God in temples. Such was Kabir’s appeal across religions that Maghar has a temple built by his Hindu disciples while his Muslim followers have a mazar in his name. With Guru Granth Sahib also having Kabir’s verses, a local gurudwara conveys the saint poet’s message. According to a senior BJP leader, the PM was visiting Maghar to spread Kabir’s message of oneness. That may not be entirely true. The PM’s aim would be to win over weavers, who are Muslims, and Other Backward Classes (OBC) who form a bulk of Kabir’s followers. The move seems to have been necessitated after setbacks in Noorpur and Kairana bye-elections in which OBCs are said to have deserted the party. With the   and the Bahujan Samaj Party joining hands, the BJP is trying to revive its social engineering formula to neutralise the political combo. While the PM’s Maghar visit will be keenly watched, the state government led by  , who bluntly said he does not believe in celebrating Eid, is subtly pressing ahead with his religious agenda. At its meeting held a couple of days back the state Cabinet decided to ban sale and consumption of alcohol in five areas in Mathura – Barsana, Radha Kund, Gokul, Nandgaon and Baldev.  Chief Minister Adityanath also called pro-temple seers, who are upset with the Modi government for not keeping its promise of building a Ram temple, for talks. Those called include Mahant Nrityagopal Das and Mahant Suresh Das, who has warned that the BJP would be defeated in elections if the temple was not built. Meanwhile, the state government is pulling all stops to make Dev Deepawali at Ayodhya, Holi in Vrindavan and Kumbh at Allahabad international events. Work on Navya (new) Ayodhya and a 108-metre tall statue of Ram along the Saryu River are in progress. A Pravasi Diwas (NRI Day) is scheduled to be held in Varanasi in the last week of January 2019 when Lok Sabha elections would be close at hand. While talking development with them, the government plans to take foreign diplomats for a holy dip in the Sangam. Talk on progress will clearly have a religious overtone. Likely renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj before Kumbh will be the highlight of that approach. Vijay Bahadur Pathak, the BJP’s state general secretary, sees nothing wrong in the government’s actions. “We are sworn to cultural nationalism and we will not conceal our faith. We will showcase whatever has been done in Varanasi, Ayodhya, Mathura and at Kumbh as Shiva, Ram and Krishna are symbols of our cultural identity.”",2018-06-08,, Modi's mosque run: Will it help | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/modi-s-mosque-run-will-it-help-117028.html
274,Rajeev Khanna,"About a year ahead of the Lok Sabha and subsequent assembly polls, the Manohar Lal Khattar led   (BJP) is in the firing line of the Opposition. The traditional parties – Congress and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) along with rookie Aam Aadmi Party ( ) have launched a series of public outreach programmes after the recent wheat harvest. To counter this onslaught, Khattar who is the face of the party in the state has started a series of road shows in major towns and cities apart from having a direct dialogue with the farmers in the villages in this predominantly rural state. Farmer issues and concerns will form the core of the political narrative in the state for both the Lok Sabha and assembly polls. In his zeal, Khattar has disclosed that Prime Minister   will soon announce implementation of on of the key recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission that pertains to a Minimum Support Price (MSP) that is 1.5 times of the production inputs. According to a government spokesperson, Khattar made this disclosure while interacting with the farmers of Pai and Habri villages in Kaithal on Friday. He has also been urging the people to remain vigilant of the Opposition leaders who may try to mislead them through cycle rally, jail bharo andolan and rath yatra. While the Congress president Ashok Tanwar has been carrying out a cycle yatra, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has embarked on a Jan Kranti Yatra and the INLD has launched a Jail Bharo Andolan on the emotive issue of completion of the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal and getting Haryana's water share from Punjab besides other concerns regarding water availability. He told the villagers on Friday that in order to address the problem of overflowing of water ponds in different villages, the state government has set up a Pond Management Authority under which the excess water flowing from the ponds would be utilized for irrigation. Pointing that there is a need to check the wastage of water in rural areas, Khattar said sewerage facilities would be made available in Mahagrams having population over 10,000. In the first phase, 16 such villages have been included under the scheme while a total of 126 villages have been identified. Khattar has been exuding confidence that the BJP would return to power on its own. Recently the INLD had entered into a pre poll pact with the Bahujan Samaj Party ( ) while there also a talk of the opposition joining hands and fielding common candidates for the Lok Sabha polls. Khattar has been conveying that the alliance of opposition in the state is a mismatch. Since there are only a few months to go before the model code of conduct comes into effect, he regular exercise of showering sops has also started. Khattar has announced that the work to prepare yellow cards for the poor and below poverty line families will commence from July 1, 2018 and one lakh yellow cards would be distributed. At a public meeting in Dhand in Kaithal that being the chief minister it is his responsibility to maintain a direct dialogue with the people and in the same series 'Mukhyamantri se Seedhi Baat' programme has been started from Pundri assembly segment on Friday. He has been playing up Modi's 'Ujjwala' and 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' programmes in his meetings claiming that the sex ratio that stood at 850 girls per 1000 boys in 2015 has increased to 915 girls per 1000 boys in 2018. He has been claiming that he has so far made 4800 announcements on various development initiatives out of which work on 3300 have been completed. Offering another sop he has announced that the Maadhogarh-Mahenderagarh-Narnaul-Rewari Heritage Circuit in southern Haryana would soon be developed as a tourism circuit under the centre's 'Swadesh Darshan Yojna' and Rs 100 crore would be spent for the purpose. Of late he has been hinting that the electricity rates would soon be reduced in the state and consumers who do not have metres would be given an opportunity to pay their power bills on the basis of the average of last one year. Penalty and interest on such consumers would also be waived off. He had recently announced that the power tariff will be reduced for small and medium enterprises having connection below 20 kilowatt. Khattar government has stood unraveled on various occasions particularly on the law and order front. It failed miserably in the face of violence on occasions like the Jat reservation stir of 2016, the mayhem caused by the followers of Gurmeet Ram Rahim in 2017 and the violence by the followers of another godman Ram Pal in 2014. The record has been miserable when it comes to violence against women and Dalits as a massive hike in cases reported as come to light in the last four years. The record has been equally bad when it comes to the targeting of minorities, particularly by the cow vigilantes. The government has been accused to playing divisive politics by pitting Jats against the remaining 35 biradaris, failing to curtail the continuing atrocities against Dalits and targeting the minorities, particularly the Muslims as was evident over the recent controversy about offering Namaaz in Gurugram. These issues will be raised at a high pitch by the opposition as the polls approach. It remains to be see how Khattar tackles them in the days to come.",2018-06-09,, Manohar Lal Khattar begins public outreach with Lok Sabha & Assembly polls in mind | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/manohar-lal-khattar-begins-public-outreach-with-lok-sabha-assembly-polls-in-mind-117186.html
275,Sulagna Sengupta,"The southern districts of West Bengal have become the latest battleground between the ruling All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) and the BJP. In the recent Panchayat elections, the AITC's vote share decreased in the south Bengal districts of West Midnapore, Jhargram, Purulia and Bankura, while the BJP's vote share increased. Now both parties are trying reach out to people in the area. AITC is taking measures to tackle infighting within the party in these districts, on the other hand BJP has set up an Adivasi Samanwaya Manch to reach out to tribals. On Tuesday, AITC dropped three ministers from the state Cabinet: backward class welfare minister Churamani Mahato, tribal development minister James Kujur and Abani Joardar, who was a minister without portfolio. The party has asked them to concentrate on organisational work. Mahato was elected four times as the Pradhan of the Gopiballavpur Gram Panchayat in Purulia. He is being sent back to revitalise the party at the grassroots. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has now brought tribal development under her own control, after James Kujur was relieved of his responsibilities. Rajib Banerjee who was earlier the state irrigation minister has been given charge of backward class welfare replacing Churamoni Mahato. Soumen Mahapatra has replaced Banerjee as the irrigation minister. After analysing the results of the Panchayat elections, AITC has formed a monitoring committee comprising senior leaders Jyoitipriyo Mullick, Saugata Roy and Chandrma Bhattacharya, who will look after the problems party workers are facing at the ground level. The committee will sit with district level AITC leaders and listen to what workers have to say. The formation of the committee is said to be a direct result of the party's below par performance in South Bengal. Sources in the AITC also said that CM Mamata Banerjee will be meeting district level leaders at the Netaji Indoor Stadium in Kolkata. She will also be interacting with the district secretaries of the AITC's youth wing. According to a senior MLA, there's resentment among people against certain MLAs who don't visit their constituencies. Also it has been noticed that since 2013, there has been a disconnect between Panchayat representatives and the people. In some cases, the representatives carried out development works without consulting the people. Srikanto Mahato, MLA from Salboni in Jhargram, said “A majority of grassroots' workers are not happy with local leaders. The dissidents have either voted for the BJP or fought the election as independent candidates. We have already told the party chief that people who are compassionate towards the development of the tribal population should be appointed in these areas. People's grievances need to be understood”. According to the statistics received from the state election commission, AITC lost 28 out of 79 Gram Panchayats in the area. In the 16 Zila Parishad seats in Jhargram, BJP secured 3 seats and the AITC 13.  In the Panchayat Samiti at Jhargram BJP secured two seats while the remaining six seats were secured by AITC. At the gram panchayat level, BJP secured 329 seats while Trinamool Congress received 372 seats. At Balarampur in Purulia, out of 20 panchayat samiti seats BJP secured 18 seats. The AITC is worried of the impact it would have in the Lok Sabha elections due next year. “The saffron party's inroads into the tribal belt of Jangalmahal and three districts of North Bengal is disturbing because such areas will send five to six MPs to the Lok Sabha. Mamata Banerjee, on the other hand, was aiming to sweep all 42 Lok Sabha seats, so that it pitches her as an important face of anti-BJP forces and give her greater clout in such a coalition”. Senior Trinamool leaders say that they party was in absolute control of the area around 2013. But after 2014, the BJP and RSS have been able to spread their influence. Gopinath Goswami a BJP worker in Balarampur said “There was no scope for open political activity in Balarampur. I first worked there as a Swayamsevak. Of late, people have begun speaking against the corruption by the government. This gave us an opportunity to mobilise people in favour of the BJP”. BJP has set up the Adivasi Samanwaya Mancha (ASM), on the lines of the AITC backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCPA) who are fighting for the development of the tribal community in this region. Lakshiram Singh Sardar, an independent Panchayat member from Binpur II area in Belpahari, is associated with the ASM. “Our main motto is to fight for the development of the tribal population in Janagalmahal areas and that is why we have participated in the electoral process,” Sardar said. The political tussle in the region is said to have taken a violent turn with alleged murder of two BJP workers Trilochan Mahato and Dulal Kumar in Purulia. BJP national president   is expected to meet with the district representatives of Jhargram and give them a plan of action. Dilip Ghosh state BJP president said “ Amit Shah will visit Jhargram district next week and he will speak with to BJP workers. He is happy with party’s performance in the recently-concluded Panchayat election”. A day after the death of Trilochan Mahato, Mamata’s nephew and AITC MP Abhishek Banerjee held a rally in Purulia, in which he claimed that AITC will make all efforts to make Purulia “Opposition free”. The BJP's success in an AITC stronghold like Balarampur in Purulia has clearly incensed the ruling party. To keep her vote bank intact, the AITC government has given a permanent job to Dhritiprasad Mahato, son of People’s Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCPA) leader Chhatradhar Mahato. He has been offered a permanent job at the Lalgarh branch of the Vidyasagar Central Co-operative Bank. The BJP, on its part, has formed armed groups with the help of the Bajrang Dal, following the death of its workers. Sayantan Basu, BJP state secretary, said “ Considering the danger posed by AITC it is necessary to form such groups in the village. We have already set up such armed groups at Supurdi village in Balarampur after taking sanction from our central leadership. We are also planning to increase the number of such groups in other South Bengal districts”. It is clear that the tensions between the AITC and BJP are only likely to increase in the days to come.",2018-06-08,, How South Bengal has emerged as the latest battlefield between Trinamool and BJP | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/how-south-bengal-has-emerged-as-the-latest-battlefield-between-trinamool-and-bjp-117035.html
276,Rajeev Khanna,"  The 'Ghar Wapsi' of poll strategist Prashant Kishor and his IPAC team to the   (BJP) appears imminent as the 2019 Lok Sabha polls approach. Sources say that things are fast moving in this direction and it is a foregone conclusion among the opposition parties as well as BJP leadership at local levels. There were speculations on this front first raised in February this year with reports appearing in a section of the media pointing to the possibility of Kishor and his team reverting to the BJP with Prime Minister   and the party's national president   at the helm. Reports at that time pointed to meetings between Modi and Kishor. Sources say that even Amit Shah who is said to be responsible for Kishor parting ways with Modi after the 2014 polls that had brought the BJP into majority under Modi, is not averse to the move at this point of time as the party is worried about its fledgling support base and the allies being miffed with the party. Sources said that the ground work for the 'Ghar Wapsi' has begun and even the recruitment for the purpose has begun for the control room that will be in Delhi this time. Kishor had joined hands with Modi ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections in 2012 to devise a strategy for the BJP's poll campaign. He crafted a campaign showing Modi as a face of good governance and administration who was being victimised by the central government led by the Congress by giving a 'step motherly' treatment to Gujarat. Thereafter he had hired a huge team large constituting pass outs from premier institutes like the IITs and IIMs besides engaging those employed with multinational companies to sell the 'Modi brand' across India. This was done through 3D shows and a well crafted social media strategy besides other innovative techniques introduced for the first time in poll strategy in India like 'Chai pe charcha' etc. All this had paid off well with the BJP coming into power with majority and Modi ascending to the office of the Prime Minister. But Kishor soon parted ways with the BJP to take on the assignment of developing a poll strategy for the   led 'Mahagathbandhan' in Bihar where he was able to contribute to the alliance making Modi and Shah bite the dust. This caught the fancy of the then Congress vice-president   and the then Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh who is the now the chief minister. From Bihar, Kishor was roped in for preparing the poll strategy for Punjab. This was his first full time assignment for the Congress and working in what is known as 'Congress culture' was not an easy job, especially under a heavyweight like Amarinder. The relationship between the two blew hot and cold with Amarinder on various occasions where Amarinder was quick to snub whenever there was an attempt to cross boundaries from preparing a poll strategy to meddling in organisational affairs. One such occasion was when Kishor held parleys with expelled Congress leaders Bir Devinder Singh and Jagmeet Singh Brar. Again it was Amarinder who put his foot down when it came to distribution of tickets as he ignored the surveys carried out by Kishor's team to give majority of the tickets based on his own calculations. Amarinder also brought in his own team for media management that proved to be far more effective. But Kishor did play an important role in the Congress' victory. He introduced campaigns like 'Coffee with Captain' to woo the youth on the lines of 'Chai pe charcha' that he had done for Modi. The campaign worked despite coffee never being a favoured drink of the Punjabis. “The twitter and Facebook campaigns along with the catchy programmes like 'Har ghar Captain' which was somewhat like 'Har har Modi, Ghar ghar Modi',” said an observer. Kishor's stint in Punjab did not end on a very cordial note. “His campaigns did help in electoral benefits but the Congress leaders are now being hounded by the people on the very same issues on which the government has failed to deliver. The biggest one of them is the promise made for distributing smart phones to the unemployed youth. This is the first issue raised by the people wherever the Congress leaders go. Kishor was made due payments for the services rendered by the Congress but there is still a dispute on the voter data which is still in his possession. If it is not resolved the same data might turn out to be an asset for the BJP in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls as it contains the minutest details about each constituency with regards to the voters, issues etc.,” sources said. Sources added that all this, Amarinder was the one who helped Kishor bag the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand poll assignments by put in a word for him to Rahul Gandhi. But Kishor did not deliver in both these states. Thereafter his organisation was engaged by YS Jaganmohan Reddy of the YSR Congress in Andhra Pradesh for the 2019 Assembly polls. Observers say that much water has flowed between 2014 and 2018 as far as Modi, Shah and BJP are concerned. While Modi remains a brand for his followers, his party is jittery about the 2019 polls with the Opposition trying to come together on a common platform. The BJP does not have much to showcase on the ground as far as economic indicators and rising unemployment are concerned. The free run that the Hindutva fringe groups have enjoyed across India targeting minorities and Dalits accompanied by Modi's stubborn silence on issues like insecurity among the minorities, cow vigilantism coupled with his party men shooting their mouths off on sensitive issues have dented his image even abroad. Things have changed or in fact come full circle. The jokes that targeted Dr   and   are now on Modi. Social media which was once the strongest weapon of the BJP is now turning out to be his bane as there has been a counter attack coming not only from the political opposition but rationalists, academics, activists and common people as well. The BJP's IT cell is making headlines for the all the wrong reasons. Fake news from all corners is being exposed instantaneously. The BJP friendly media's credibility is at an all time low. In such a scenario, the party desperately needs a well planned exhaustive image building exercise. This is a reason good enough to rope in Kishor once again. But will he be able to deliver in 2019 as in 2014? Only time will tell.  ",2018-06-11,, Why Prashant Kishor's 'Ghar Wapsi' to Modi looks imminent | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-prashant-kishor-s-ghar-wapsi-to-modi-looks-imminent-117474.html
277,Aditya Menon,"The Congress and JD(S) got into the act even before the results were announced. Apparently, the Grand Old Party realised that it wasn't going to win a majority on its own so it began sending feelers to the JD(S) a day before the results. As the results showed that the BJP was clearly emerging as the single largest party, Congress President   was quick to offer the Chief Ministership to the JD(S). He deputed senior general secretaries Ashok Gehlot and Ghulam Nabi Azad to the state. Former Congress President   too spoke to JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda. The JD(S) on its part was quick to respond to the Congress' proposal, instead of negotiating a deal with the BJP.   supremo  , West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen President   are all said to have spoken to the JD(S) and urged it to align with the Congress to keep the BJP away from power in Karnataka. It must be remembered that the BSP and AIMIM had backed JD(S) during the polls as well. However, Governor Vala had other plans and he invited Yeddyurappa to form the government, giving him 15 days to prove his majority. This could have sealed the deal for the BJP, giving it sufficient time to put pressure on Opposition MLAs. But this was prevented by some extremely proactive and persuasive legal maneuvering by the Congress. The Congress leadership deputed one of the party's key legal brains Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who approached the Supreme Court the night before Yeddyurappa's swearing-in. Eventually, it was the Supreme Court's intervention that came to the Congress-JD(S)'s rescue. The three-member bench gave Yeddyurappa just two days to prove his majority, instead of the 15 days that had been given by Governor Vala. This made it easier for the Congress and JD(S) to hold its flock together. While Singhvi and his team were fighting it out in the Supreme Court, a parallel battle was going on in Bengaluru. Congress MLA from Kanakpura DK Shivakumar took up the task of preventing attempts by the BJP to poach its MLAs. He is said to have been assisted in this task by Hebbal MLA BS Suresh and his brother. Shivakumar also brought Independent MLA Nagesh on the Congress' side. In JD(S), Kumaraswamy personally took up the task of ensuring that none of his MLAs defect to the BJP. Since a majority of MLAs were from the same Vokkaliga dominated belt as Kumaraswamy, they were unlikely to go against him as it would mean a certain defeat in a repoll. The party's moneybags MP Kupendra Reddy also is said to have played an important role. However, Kumaraswamy didn't want to leave anything to chance and prepared to take his MLAs to a “neutral” state. In this process, he was in touch with various non-BJP chief ministers like Pinarayi Vijayan of Kerala, K Chandrashekhar Rao of Telangana and N Chandrababu Naidu of Andhra Pradesh. Interestingly, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is also said to have been advising Kumaraswamy through this process. For the Congress, it proved to be far more difficult to keep the MLAs united. Two MLAs – Anand Singh of Hosapete and Pratapgouda Patil of Maski – went missing, suppposedly under the BJP's pressure. However, this wasn't enough for the BJP. It needed 7 defections or 15 abstentions and all it seemed to have been able to secure was the support of the KPJP MLA and two possible abstentions (Singh and Patil). Yeddyurappa acted swiftly and transferred a few key police officers, hoping to take control of the administration and put more pressure on the Opposition MLAs. But the SC's intervention placed serious restrictions on what Yeddyurappa could do as CM. The court clearly instructed him not to take any major policy decisions. By Friday evening, the numbers still did not favour the BJP. The party's in-charge for Karnataka – Union HRD Minister   – is said to have communicated to BJP president Amit Shah that the situation wasn't in the party's favour. The Congress, on Friday evening, began releasing audios of BJP leaders allegedly trying to bribe Congress MLAs to defect. The first audio to be released was that of mining baron Gali Janardana Reddy. By Saturday, the audios kept pouring in with alleged conversations of Yeddyurappa, his son MLA B Sriramulu and even BJP general secretary P Muralidhar Rao, bribing MLAs being made public. This put paid to any possible negotiation with Congress and JD(S) MLAs. Both the battle of perception as well as the numbers were firmly in favour of the Congress-JD(S) combine. The final act of the drama played out on Saturday. The police “rescued” Congress MLA Pratapgouda Patil from Goldfinch Hotel in Bengaluru. The Congress alleged that he was being held hostage by the BJP. The hotel, incidentally belongs to Prakash Shetty, a Mangalore based hotelier known to be close to the BJP. The hotel is a common venue for several BJP meetings and functions. Soon, Patil was seen being escorted to the Assembly by Shivakumar. Anand Singh too resurfaced dramatically and came to the Vidhana Soudha. His wife reportedly could be seen thanking Shivakumar with folded hands, adding to the melodrama. The Kanakapura MLA, who is being hailed as the hero for the Congress-JD(S) alliance, could be seen holding Singh's hand and taking him to his seat in the Congress cluster in the Assembly. The writing was on the wall. Yeddyurappa had lost. Amit Shah, BJP's 'secret weapon', had proven to be a dud. Shivakumar outwitted Shah for the second time, the last time being when he protected 43 MLAs from Gujarat to ensure Ahmed Patel's victory in the Rajya Sabha elections. Irrespective of whether JD(S)-Congress manage to form the government or not, Shivakumar's and Singhvi's stature within the party is only going to risein the days to come.The Congress and the   (Secular) pulled off a major coup in Karnataka by preventing the   from cobbling up enough numbers to form a government in the state. BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa resigned as Chief Minister on Saturday even before taking the vote of confidence. This was barely 55 hours after he had been sworn in by Governor Vajubhai Vala. This is a huge embarrassment for the party as only a few days back BJP leaders were boasting ""We have  "" on being asked how the BJP would be able to form the government despite not having the numbers. In the end, the party could not get even a single Congress and JD(S) MLA to defect. Even the solitary Bahujan Samaj Party MLA as well as one Independent did not end up joining its ranks. This, despite the buzz that MLAs were being offered as much as Rs 100 crore to switch sides. Here's how the two parties managed to outwit the mighty BJP.",2018-05-19,, Karnataka: How Congress-JD(S) turned the tables on Modi-Shah and the men who did it  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/karnataka-how-congress-jd-s-turned-the-tables-on-modi-shah-and-the-men-who-did-it-113839.html
278,Sulagna Sengupta,"Even though the ruling All-India Trinamool Congress (AITC) swept the recently concluded Panchayat elections in West Bengal, it performed poorly in the Jangalmahal region. Jangalmahal is a local term used for the tribal dominated areas in the districts of Purulia, West Midnapore, Jhargram and Bankura. Analysts feel this is partly due to factional infighting within the AITC on one hand and on the other, the efforts of the RSS that led to an increase in the BJP's vote share. For instance in Jhargram, BJP won 329 Gram Panchayats, not far behind AITC's 372. At Balarampur in Purulia, BJP secured 18 out of 20 Panchayat Samiti seats. Imankalyan Lahiri, a political observer, feels that “BJP has been able to rope in Swami Aseemanand to mobilise Adivasis in various parts of West Bengal. He has already set up various schools in different Jangalmahal areas and this has given BJP an edge in organising their cadres. RSS also has increased their activities in tribal areas.” AITC, on its part, admits to factionalism in the BJP ranks. Churamoni Mahato, Trinamool MLA from Gopiballavpur in Jhargram, said “After analaysing the results, we found that the increase in BJP’s vote share is at the Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayat level. It seems that many grassroot workers (from AITC) aren't happy with the leaders and may have voted for the BJP. At the Zilla Parishad level, we won almost all the seats in the region. We have submitted our report to the chief minister and urged her to take some steps to reduce infighting in the party in this region.” A senior Trinamool Congress leader said “We have found that in some areas in Jangalmahal particularly at Balarmpur in Purulia, Salboni and Gopiballavpur in Jhargram, the MLA’s did not share a good rapport with ground level workers.” According to Sukhomoy Sathpathi, Jhargram Zilla sabhapati of the BJP, “Trinamool Congress has made false promises to the people of Jangalmahal. The living conditions of tribals in the interior villages have not improved much despite Banerjee’s efforts. Around 20% tribals are prohibited from receiving rice at Rs 2 per kg as announced by the state government. On the other hand, the wealth of some Zilla sabhapatis of the ruling Trinamool Congress party has increased substantially”. Sathpathi said “ There are many dissidents within AITC. In the next election, BJP may use the dissidents for our own interests. We are hopeful of increasing our base. We have won almost 30% Panchayat Samiti seats and 38% Gram Panchayat seats at Purulia, Jhargram, West Midnapore and Bankura”. Maidul Islam, another political analysts, said “ The rise of BJP is Jangalmahal areas is because Banerjee failed to address the problems of the tribals. For the last 60 years, their livelihhod pattern has not been changed. The state government has announced rehabilitation package for the Maoist who surrendered arms and lead a normal life, but she failed to address the plight of the tribals who once marched against the atrocities perpetrated by the CPI(M). This has led to increase in factionalism among the AITC leaders and ground workers”. Partha Chatterjee, state parliamentary affairs minister, said ""We are yet to analyse the reports from Jangalmahal . We knew that our performance was not good. That's why we have decided to organise some camps in in those areas. We will hold meetings with all the tribals to discuss their problems.""",2018-05-21,, Trinamool worried as its popularity falls in Jangalmahal.

279,Charu Kartikeya,"The day began with the Supreme Court rejecting the Congress party's appeal to remove KG Bopaiah as the pro-tem speaker. However, the apex court allowed the floor test to be telecast live, in order to ensure full transparency. Then emerged rumours of BJP having succeeded in poaching at least 2-3 Congress MLAs. Congress accused mining barons Reddy brothers of having kidnapped these MLAs at a hotel. Since the Supreme Court had ordered the DGP to ensure the protection of all MLAs before the trust vote, he personally went to the hotel later to check on these remours. Minutes later, these very MLAs appeared in the Assembly, with Congress' Vokkaliga strongman DK Shivakumar in tow. The implication was clear – if any attempt had indeed been made to poach them, it had failed. The BJP's failure to cobble up the numbers it was boasting about became clear within minutes, as Yeddyurappa started presenting what seemed like a farewell speech in the Assembly. His addressed was interspersed with several bursts of crying, as he tried to convince that the only objective behind all the manoeuvrings he and his party indulged in was to serve the farmers of the state. Promising to serve the people of the state in power or in the Opposition, Yeddyurappa announced his resignation from the CM's position, even before facing the floor test. Commentators were quick to recall former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's similar resignation in the Lok Sabha in 1996 that he too was forced to tender before facing the floor test. The major difference, however, behind the two situations is that Vajpayee, in his speech, had steadfastly refused to resort to the manipulations that the BJP carried out in Karnataka. The BJP's failure to form the government in Karnataka will come as a big boost for the morale of Congress workers across the country. Getting used to seeing their party lose to an ever-expanding BJP even where the latter did not have the numbers, Congress workers will now be able to hope that with the right strategy, their party can still win elections. The Congress's hard-fought victory was the result of a successful three-pronged strategy. While senior leaders of the party lost no time in reaching out to JD(S) for a post-poll alliance on the latter's terms, its legal team snatched power from the BJP's jaws, getting the SC to curtail the 15-day window given by the Governor to the BJP to just one. The third part of the strategy, and the most crucial one, was to do everything possible to keep its flock intact. With strongmen like Shivakumar watching over and with critical help from the ruling TRS in Hyderabad, where all Congress MLAs were sent for a day, the Congress succeeded remarkably in this task. The roller-coaster developments in Karnataka have given two indications. First is that the Congress is finding its mojo back. The party made a quick move for an unconditional post-poll alliance, that woo with a rival, even after not getting the numbers. In the process, it learned the importance of allowing strong regional parties to take the lead. The Congress then launched and saw to the end a successful legal battle, not allowing any move by the BJP to go unchallenged. Both these strategies showed that four years after facing decimation at hands of the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress party is regaining the stomach for a fight. More crucial, however, was the first display of opposition unity in the anti-BJP camp after the Bihar elections of 2015. A number of opposition leaders had critical roles to play in the entire saga.   chief   not just got her lone MLA in the state to support the Congress-JD(S) combine, she also spoke to JD(S) chief H D Devegowda to urge him to make the alliance happen. Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee also spoke to the former PM to make the same appeal. CPI(M) also expressed support, with Congress thinking about packing off its MLAs to a resort in Kochi at one point of time. Neighbouring CMs Chandrababu Naidu and K Chandrashekhar Rao also extended support to this campaign, promising to provide protection to the Congress flock in their respective states. If this sentiment can be further worked upon, a Grand Alliance to give the BJP a run for its money in 2019 could be easier to stitch-up than previously thought. From that perspective, the floor-test saga in Karnataka could become a watershed moment.The   (BJP) Saturday got a bitter dose of its own medicine plus an additionally bitter shot with the fall of its two-day-old government in Karnataka. BS Yeddyurappa's resignation even before the floor test is likely to be remembered as one of the most embarrassing moments in the party's history. If previous developments in Goa and Manipur had established BJP chief   as the master of electoral intrigue, the imbroglio in Karnataka has snatched away that credential from him.  Not only has the BJP been forced to sit out of power in spite of emerging as the single-largest party, its state as well as central leadership has been left red-faced. The party brazenly deployed all underhand tricks a democratic power-play has room for and yet failed miserably. In the process, it also ended up sullying the high Constitutional office of the Governor and the humbling process of government formation itself. The spectacle of Congress MLAs rumoured to have been 'poached' trooping into the Assembly and voting for the JD(S)-Congress alliance was a sight to behold.",2018-05-19,, Why the fall of Yeddyurappa's 2-day govt means much more than just loss of face for BJP | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-the-fall-of-yeddyurappa-s-2-day-govt-means-much-more-than-just-loss-of-face-for-bjp-113841.html
280,Anurag Dey,"BJP president   believes that had the Supreme Court not ordered immediate floor test and the Congress and JD(S) not kept their MLAs away, BJP could well have crunched the requisite numbers and formed the government in Karnataka. Amid the allegations of horse trading against the Shah on Monday admitted that had BJP got the 15-days’ time originally granted by Governor Vajubhai Vala, the scenario in the southern state would have been vastly different. Two days after BJP Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa exited, conceding defeat ahead of the floor test, Shah held a media conference in the national capital where he stoutly defended the decision to bid for government formation in Karnataka. Shah also tried to claim moral victory asserting the popular mandate was with the BJP and not with the “unholy alliance” of Congress –JD(S). “As regards the 15 days’ time, I firmly believe that if the MLAs were not locked up and allowed to meet with the people, things would have been different,” said Shah to a query on the possibilities if the apex court had not curtailed the 15 days window. Asked to comment on charges of horse trading against the BJP, Shah said: “We never believe in horse-trading. Congress should answer what they did with MLAs by locking them in a five-star hotel”. Following a petition by Congress and JD(S) MLAs, a SC bench on 18 May had ordered the floor test be conducted on 19 May thereby curtailing the half month time given to the BJP which had emerged as the single largest party with 104 seats but could not reach the half-way mark in the 224 member Assembly. Despite brazenly deploying all underhand tricks, the BJP was forced to sit out of power with Yeddyurappa's resigning obviating the need for a floor test. His resignation paved the way for the JD(S)-Congress coalition led by former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy to form the new government. But Shah refused to concede defeat. “The people of Karnataka gave us the mandate. It is an anti-Congress mandate; there should be no confusion about it. “Nobody got the majority but does that mean we go for reelection? BJP was the single largest party, hence we staked the claim. If we hadn’t done that it would have been against the people’s mandate,” said Shah. He also contested the argument that the Congress was not given the opportunity to form the government in Goa and Manipur despite emerging as the single largest party in both the states. “They often cite the examples of Manipur and Goa. But I want to make it clear that in both the states, Congress did not stake claim. The Governor invited us only after the Congress did not stake claim in both the states,” claimed Shah. Continuing to attack Congress, Shah wondered what the party was celebrating about. “Despite losing seats, more than half of their ministers losing including their chief minister, the Congress is celebrating victory. “Wonder what the Congress is celebrating about. Are they celebrating being reduced to PPP - Punjab, Puducherry, Parivaar party,” said Shah referring to a jibe by Prime Minister   against the Congress. “The JD(S)’ entire campaign was focused on anti-Congress. Their mandate too is anti-Congress, how can they now join hands. This is unholy alliance,” said Shah who also handed out a collection of CM designate HD Kumaraswamy’s comments against the Congress as reported by the media. Shah also took potshots over Congress not complaining either about the EVM hacking or the judiciary being influenced by the BJP. “Amid all this what is good to see is that Congress seems to have regained its trust on constitutional bodies like Supreme Court and Election Commission. They have even now have faith in the EVMs. It is good sign. I hope this trust, this faith is intact even when they are losing,” he added with a chuckle. He also claimed that the Congress lawyer lied in the Supreme Court that Yeddyurappa had sought seven days’ time from the Governor to prove majority in the House.",2018-05-21,," Amit Shah blames SC intervention, Congress-JD(S) 'unholy' alliance for Karnataka setback    | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/amit-shah-blames-sc-intervention-congress-jd-s-unholy-alliance-for-karnataka-setback-114083.html
281,Riyaz Wani,"Just when we expected the campaign for Central Bureau of India (CBI) probe into the Kathua rape and murder to fizzle out after the Supreme Court ruled it out, the demand for it has only gotten stronger in Jammu. Ousted   (BJP) minister Lal Singh’s continuing public rallies in support for it have seen crowd growing. The latest rally on Sunday drew an estimated 25,000 people. The rally christened ‘Dogra Swabhiman Rally' (rally for Dogra self-esteem) started at Lakhanpur, bordering Punjab and went to Londi Morh Kootah. A large number of protesters, including Singh walked the 36-kilometre stretch. Others accompanied on buses, cars and bikes. In his address to a charged-up crowd Singh made a case for a CBI probe by framing argument in terms of quest for the justice for the eight-year-old victim, calling her “a daughter of Dogras”. At the same time he played to the local sentiment and made the issue a larger battle for restoring the “dignity and honour” of Dogras. “This rally is an answer to all those who labelled the Dogras of Jammu as pro-rapist, hate-mongers and communal people with bigoted mindset and accused us of creating hurdles in delivering justice,” Singh said and the crowd nodded in approval. “Dogras are facing the worst-ever onslaught on their dignity and honour. We have to launch a decisive battle,” he added. The campaign has come a long way since Singh launched it soon after resigning as the state forest minister last month. He and former industries and commerce minister Chander Prakash Ganga were ousted from the Cabinet for participating in a rally of the Hindu Ekta Manch in support of the accused. Now it is less about the CBI probe and more about reconfiguring the political landscape in Jammu in the run-up to the next year’s General Election, to be followed by state Assembly polls in 2020. What has also changed is its bitterly polarising nature. Singh has tried to avert it by recruiting some Jammu Muslims and pitting them against Kashmiri Muslims. “Gone are the days when the Kashmir-centric parties could gag our voice through oppressive means. Now Dogras have decided to fight,” 59-year-old Singh said. “We don’t want any lessons on secularism and brotherhood from Kashmir-centric parties, which lack guts to speak against fundamentalists. Since times immemorial Dogras have accommodated people of all religion and regions.” There were slogans against Kashmiri parties. Singh’s brother Rajinder even called Chief Minister   a “dog”. What was not lost on political observers is that Singh could draw massive crowds in Kathua and Sambha districts. This has worried the BJP, which is looking to improve upon its electoral tally in Jammu. The party won 25 of the 37 seats in the province. BJP leaders from the area – Assembly Speaker Nirmal Singh and newly inducted ministers Rajiv Jasrotia and Devendra Kumar Manyal – are fast losing confidence of their voters. Tempers run so high that earlier this month protesters stoned the cavalcade of another BJP minister Sham Lal Choudhary's on the Jammu-Pathankot highway. The disaffection could only further spread in the province, with a growing number of thepeople certain about the false implication of the accused by a Crime Branch team which though headed by a Hindu has Muslim investigators as its members. And should the campaign crystallise into an anti-BJP mood and rebel Singh succeed in harvesting it for his personal political glory, it could signal deeper trouble for the BJP. In the rest of the country outrage against the rape and murder was more or less uniform. So, the BJP didn’t feel the need to acquiesce in to the demand for a CBI probe. In Jammu, it still has time to conrol the situation. Besides, Singh remains a BJP leader and will be a challenge only once he quits. The party has adopted the line that while it is not against the CBI probe, it can do little after the Supreme Court ruled it out. But the danger inherent in Singh’s campaign, despite his belated secularisation bid, is its possible communal turn – if not against Jammu Muslims then certainly against their Kashmiri counterparts. And should that happen, its political fallout will not remain limited to the state.",2018-05-21,, Lal Singh's mega rally: Long political shadow of Kathua rape and murder | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/lal-singh-s-mega-rally-long-political-shadow-of-kathua-rape-and-murder-114074.html
282,Rajeev Khanna,"The Saurashtra region has emerged as the eye of atrocities against Dalit though many, including local journalists, dispute this. Surendranagar district in the region is among those referred to as one of the most atrocity-prone districts. Vaniya too was a resident of the district's Parmala village. Vaniya, a rag picker, was beaten to death Sunday at a factory in Rajkot's Shapar Veraval industrial area, sources said. When he along with his wife and a female relative went looking for scrap they were apprehended on charges of theft by the owner of the fatory and some workers, a source alleged. While Vaniya was mercilessly beaten up with sticks and belts, the two women managed to escape and went looking for help, screaming all the way. When they returned they found him writhing in pain, crying for help. When they took him to a hospital, it declared him dead, sources said. The police allegedly took their time making arrests, waiting for the deceased's post-mortem report. Things started moving only when video grabs from closed-circuit television cameras went viral. Eventually, the owner of the automobile parts factory and four others were arrested and charged with murder and various sections under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. “He went to Rajkot with his wife looking for livelihood only a few days ago. The family members cremated him at his village Monday after an assurance from the Rajkot Collector for due monetary compensation and five acres of land. If the administration dithers, therer would be a massive agitation,” said Nattubhai Parmar, a Dalit activist from Surendranagar, who attended the cremation. The question that has emerged: why is there no decline in atrocities against Dalits in Gujarat in general and Saurashtra in particular? “The insensitivity of the government fails to curtail atrocities. Perpetrators have got the message that they can get away with anything. Action is taken only after extreme incidents like flogging or killing,” Parmar said. A major grudge Dalits have is that cases of atrocities are diluted or perverted by the police and administration. They remain be peeved at the government for failing to make the report of the probe panel on the 2012 Thangadh killings public despite adverse observations by the Gujarat High Court. People still remember the public flogging in Una (2016) of Dalits for carrying out their vocation of skinning cattle carcass. In several other instances Dalits have been targeted for issues like sporting a mustache or twirling them in from of those from upper castes, attending garba, riding motorbikes by upper-caste houses, ritual riding of horses during weddings and for using surnames like 'Singh'. They are often denied hair cuts by village barber shops, served in separate utensils at tea stalls, made to sit separately for mid-day meals in schools, denied entry into temples and denied water from common wells. Accounting for only seven per cent of the state's population and widely scattered, Dalits in Gujarat are one of the most vulnerable – marginaliSed socially as well as politically. In March, a Dalit was allegedly hacked for buying and riding a horse at a village in Bhavnagar district. Dalits opposed the police letting off upper-caste 'Darbars' accused by the victim's father. They instead arrested a marginal farmer from other backward classes a month and a half down the line, saying that he killed the deceased for teasing his wife. The latest instance once again elaborates the ground for Dalit unrest over the alleged dilution of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act across the country.Dalit unrest has been fueled once again with yet another alleged killing of a youth from the community on the periphery of Rajkot city in Gujarat's Saurashtra region. The 'Gujarat Model' of governance that has been played up across the country by Prime Minister   and his close associate  , the national president of   (BJP), stands shamed again. Agitated Dalits are blaming the insensitive attitude of the state's BJP government for the frequent recurrence of heinous atrocities against them.

285,Rajeev Khanna,"Although it is just a bye-poll which is not going to have any bearing in terms of numbers in the state assembly, the Tharali by-election in Uttarakhand has assumed the stature of a referendum of sorts for the Trivendra Singh Rawat led   (BJP) led government in the hill state. It will a barometer to test the popularity of the Trivendra government that continues to draw flak for being a 'U-turn' government that, like several other BJP governments, is accused of being good at making noises poor when it comes to delivery. The Congress is desperate for a victory and wants to show that it is on the path of revival after a whitewash in last year's Assembly poll when it was trounced by the BJP that won 57 of the 70 seats. The party is now looking towards a better performance in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls. To counter it, the BJP is going full throttle to retain this seat where a bye-poll has been necessitated following the demise of its MLA Magan Lal Shah. The BJP wants to send across the message that it still is the most popular choice of the people under the national leadership of its president   and Prime Minister  . The party had contested the assembly polls last year with Modi as its mascot and Trivendra had eventually emerged as a surprise candidate for the chief minister's post with his RSS backdrop helping him emerge the top choice of the party. The BJP has fielded Shah's widow Munni Devi who is the Zilla Panchayat chairperson and is banking highly on the sympathy factor. The party has pressed several state level heavyweights into campaign. On the other hand, the Congress has fielded former MLA Jeet Ram who had lost to Shah in the last year's poll. The flash floods in the Pindar river in 2013 that had washed away around 160 houses while damaging hundreds of others had a bearing on the fate of the Congress candidate in the 2017 polls. Apart from thee residential structures, a motorable bridge at Tharali along with several small bridges on different rivulets connecting around 50 small villages with arterial roads and several pedestrian bridges had also been washed out. The people were agitated over the slow pace of repairs and restoration works. The seat had been won by the Congress in 2012. The Left parties have also closed ranks to field Kunwar Ram of CPM as their candidate while the lone regional force Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) has fielded Kashbi Lal Shah. Beere Ram is the lone independent horse in the race. The result of the bye-poll would make no difference to the Trivendra led government in terms of numbers as it is firmly in the saddle with a brute majority but a loss would certainly add to its poor reputation on delivery of poll promises. The state continues to face the issues pertaining to employment, poor health facilities and other infrastructure, migration and corruption. Uttarakhand is a classic example of the youngest small states being failed by their politicians and bureaucrats. Trivendra government has earned the nomenclature of a 'U-turn sarkaar' for itself as the government has failed to deliver on what it had promised with aplomb. The biggest issue being pointed out is the Rs 350 crore National Highway 74 scam. “It was Trivendra himself who had sought a CBI probe into the matter and has now reverted to the matter being investigated by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the state after the centre turned down his request and it was none other than union road transport and highways minister   who had opposed it,” points out senior Congress leader Suryakant Dhasmana. Trivendra's opponents then refer to his promise of bringing in prohibition in the state and then not only going back on his promise but bringing in an excise policy that has rather facilitated easy access to alcohol in the remotest parts of the hills. “We have had mobile vans delivering alcohol and excise officials being suspended after being held responsible for liquor shops running in losses,” Dhasmana added. The state government is also on the back foot for earlier promising and then going back on its words on the setting up of the institution of a Lokayukta and bringing about an anti-graft law. Another prominent example being given in support of terming the government as a 'U-turn sarkaar' is the manner in which the government first allowed the private medical colleges to increase their fees and then retracting when the colleges went into an overdrive by increasing the fees by as much as seven times the prevailing structure. Locals say that these colleges raised fees from Rs 4 lakh per annum to Rs 28 lakh in certain courses before the government had to eat crow. The BJP has been playing up the state government claims on zero tolerance for corruption while pointing at the more than 20 arrests that have been made in the NH 74 scam. It is also continuing with its promises of early delivery through the double engine government with the same party being in power in both the Centre as well as the state. But there is another dimension as well to Trivendra not being on as firm a footing as he was at the time of his anointment. There has been dissidence brewing with many leaders, particularly those who had migrated ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls from the Congress to the BJP, upset at their being ignored and sidelined. Trivendra trying to sideline former Congress heavyweight Satpal Maharaj is common knowledge and point of political discussions. “Satpal has always been seen as another contender for the chief minister's post. His coming from a religio-political backdrop and his close links with the RSS on religious grounds has been his strength. It is Amit Shah's backing that has been working in favour of Trivendra. The government has being trying to belittle Satpal Maharaj on various occasions and this is common knowledge,” said a political analyst based at Dehradun. Another former Congress leader Harak Singh Rawat who had migrated to the BJP is also learnt to be upset with Trivendra for his works being ignored. Sources say that the same is the case with former Congress chief minister Vijay Bahuguna who stands 'sidelined' after not being given any post of consequence. It is amid such a scenario that Tharali will be sending a strong political signal on 28 May that will definitely have a bearing on the Lok Sabha polls in the state next year.",2018-05-22,, Tharali bye-poll: Why it will be a referendum for 'U-turn' Trivendra govt in Uttarakhand | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/tharali-bye-poll-why-it-will-be-a-referendum-for-u-turn-trivendra-govt-in-uttarakhand-114224.html
286,Charu Kartikeya,"Last week's developments in Karnataka have once again brought the role of the Governor under scrutiny. Appointed by the President after being selected by the Union government of the day, the office of the Governor has consistently been among the most controversial constitutional authorities. Governors have similar powers and functions at the state level as that of the President at the Union level. They enjoy sweeping powers vis-a-vis the process of formation and dismissal of state governments, which they have often misused in keeping with the convenience of the party in power at the centre. For example, Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala last week invited BJP leader B S Yeddyurappa to form the government in spite of the BJP not having the required numbers. Further, the Governor also gave Yeddyurappa 15 days to prove majority in the state Assembly. Both these decisions gave BJP an edge over rivals Congress and JD(S). However, the rival parties moved the Supreme Court against the invitation and the 15-day period. The SC is still hearing the arguments question the Governor's invite but it struck down the 15-day period instantly and gave Yeddyurappa just one day. This judicial intervention proved to be critical to the political developments. Unable to secure support of MLAs outside the BJP's fold in such a short period, Yeddyurappa resigned in the Assembly even before facing the floor test. In this melee, BJP's rivals were quick to point out that Vala, a former BJP leader from Gujarat, was being loyal to his former party and not the Constitution. Vala is not alone in the long list of 35 Governors, Lieutenant Governors and Administrators to have past linkages with the BJP. At least 22 of them, including Vala, have been formally associated with the BJP in various capacities. These include - Jagdish Mukhi - Assam Satya Pal Malik - Bihar Balramji Dass Tandon - Chhattisgarh Mridula Sinha - Goa Om Prakash Kohli – Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh Kaptan Singh Solanki - Haryana Droupadi Murmu - Jharkhand Vajubhai Vala - Karnataka Chennamaneni Vidyasagar Rao - Maharashtra Najma A.

289,Joyjeet Das,"The cheers of the green-and-white flag-waving JD(D) supporters collected on the lawns of the Vidhana Soudha – Karnataka's legislative seat that the BJP so desperately wanted to dominate – spilled over up to the High Court premises across the road. The brevity of the occasion was outdone by those cheers as it was by the bonhomie on display on the stage by a veritable who-is-who of Indian politics: Bahujan Samaj Party supremo   in a trademark neutral suit, beaming, was one of the first to enter the frame. She was seated next to new-found ally in Uttar Pradesh,   President  . From the other side entered West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in her usual white cotton sari, walking with a purpose up to Kumaraswamy. Sharad Yadav, who has only recently launched the Loktantrik Janta Dal, walked over to greet her. The CM-designate walked in with his family. His father and party patriarch, former prime minister HD Deve Gowda, walked up to the front stage and bowed to the crowd in front. The last time his son took this oath – 12 years ago, supported by the BJP – he had distanced himself, keeping his anti-BJP credentials intact. There was Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the CM of Andhra Pradesh, a part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, up to only recently. From Maharashtra, Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar, a veteran of many political fights, attended. From the Left there were Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary  , his Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan and CPI National Secretay D Raja. Staunch Congress ally Rashtriya Janata Dal was represented by party chief  's son Tejashwi. He might have been the youngest among the guests but was among the most vocal supporters of Kumaraswamy being made the CM when Governor Vajubhai Vala overlooked him for BS Yeddyurappa from parent BJP. There was also western UP strongman Ajit Singh of the  . Congress President Rahul Gandhi walked in with his mother and United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi and outgoing CM Siddaramaiah. Tamil Nadu Opposition Leader MK Stalin of the Dravida Munnetra Khazagam, could not attend as he went to Thoothukudi after Tuesday's police firing killed 11 anti-Sterlite protestors. Telangana CM K Chandrasekhara Rao and Delhi CM   had met Kumaraswamy earlier. Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik skipped the event citing planned engagements. But Wednesday was about those present on the stage and the possibilities they can create. Usual bickering was replaced by smiles, hugs and holding hands. Sonia's show of warmth to the senior leaders, especially to Mayawati and Banerjee was not missed by the cameras. Ditto for the affection that seniors bestowed upon young 'uns like the two Yadavs. Their fathers – Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad – had been part of several such endeavours during their 'Janata' days. One can't be blamed for thinking that the old Janata experiment was the leitmotif throughout Wednesday's event. The throw-back to 1996 was imminent: Deve Gowda was then chosen to lead the central Cabinet by the Janata Dal-led United Front, supported by Congress, to keep the BJP from forming its first government. The passionate movement for building a Ram temple in Ayodhya in place of the Babri Masjid had permanently changed political equations. The Janata Dal was forged in 1988 by former PM VP Singh on a strong anti-Congress plank. He also united a disparate group of leaders from Assam to Tamil Nadu on the same issue. With outside support from the BJP and the Left he ascended the hot seat in 1989. But the very next year he had to give up power after Lalu Yadav – then Bihar CM from Janata Dal – stopped Lal Krishna Advani's Ram juggernaut and arrested him in Samastipur. Tejashwi had not even turned one then; Akhilesh was 13. Deve Gowda's own government tumbled down in 1997 when the Congress, then led by Sitaram Kesri, refused to continue support. For a few more months Inder Kumar Gujaral continued heading that government until eventually the Congress completely withdrew support in 1998. That was the end of the United Front as it was known then. Subsequent efforts to work out 'Third Fronts' proved futile. Twenty years later, the same Deve Gowda was like a mascot on the stage on Wednesday, a nucleus of political heavyweights forming around the swearing-in of his son. The Congress is again in a supporting role with more seats, but as a partner in government this time.  If the goal then was to resist the BJP from assuming power in the aftermath of the Babri demolition (1992) and a corruption-stained reign of PV Narasimha Rao, this time it is to stop the saffron party's victory march and oust it from power. That is a tall task, but ousting the Congress also once looked equally difficult. Yet it was achieved through years of collaboration. Is India looking at another such political realignment? Will it last? After Kumaraswamy's oath-taking one lasting image was him holding hands high with Congress strongman DK Shivakumar. The two Vokkaliga leaders from different parties have had a bitter relationship until now, but Shivakumar was one of the force behind guarding the JD(S)-Congress flock together from being poached by the BJP. If their show of unity survives the topsy-turvy of governance, if the two parties can start for Lok Sabha 2019 United then that can be a primer for all those on the stage Wednesday. And if they do bury mutual differences and ego then BJP chief   should be a worried man. For ensuring Narendra Modi's second term as PM, 31% (voteshare) will then not be enough.Three days before   completes four years in office, a large section of political parties opposed to him presented a colourful show of strength in Bengaluru Wednesday. The occasion: the swearing-in of HD Kumaraswamy as the chief minister of Karnataka.  It was a short affair: the   (Secular) leader was quickly administered the oath of office as was state Congress chief G Parameshwara (as Kumaraswamy's deputy) by Governor Vajubhai Vala, preceded and followed by the National Anthem.",2018-05-23,, Kumaraswamy swears in amid bonhomie in rainy Bengaluru.

290,Catch Team,"The latest Mood of the Nation Survey by the Centre for Study of Developing Societies and ABP News has revealed that Prime Minister  's popularity has dipped significantly, even though the National Democratic Alliance is still ahead of the United Progressive Alliance at this juncture. The survey brings good news for the Opposition as well as provides a roadmap by which it could come close to defeating the mighty   machinery under Modi and  . There are four key findings of the survey: First, it shows that there's general dissatisfaction against PM Modi's government on a number of fronts, particularly in its handling of the economy and failure to generate jobs. Second,  's popularity has increased and the gap between him and Modi as the country's preferred prime ministerial choice is about 10%. Third, Modi's popularity has fallen in the very constituencies he has tried hard to woo: Dalits and Adivasis. It has also worsened among farmers and traders. Fourth, it shows that the BJP-led alliance is likely to be decimated in South India and face significant losses in North, West and Central India. It will be able to make up for some of these losses through gains in the East. However, the most significant aspect of the survey is that it provides a roadmap to the Opposition by which it can defeat Modi: pre-poll alliances. According to the survey, the NDA is likely to get a vote share of 37%, around the same as what it got in the 2014 general elections. However, the UPA's projected vote share is 31%, 6% more than what it got in 2014. Significantly, CSDS has created another category “  and allies” comprising the Bahujan Samaj Party,  ,   (Secular) and Indian National Lok Dal. This alliance is projected to get 10% of the votes. These cluster of parties are almost certain to align against the BJP. If the UPA enters into a pre-poll alliance with these cluster of parties, the combined vote share will be 41%, 4% ahead of the NDA. This cluster of parties has already aligned with the Congress in Karnataka, where JD(S)'s HD Kumaraswamy was recently sworn in as the Chief Minister. In Uttar Pradesh too, this alliance could be on the cards if the upcoming bye-poll for the Kairana Lok Sabha is any indication. Here the SP, BSP and Congress are all supporting an SP leader contesting on a   ticket. It is in Uttar Pradesh that the NDA is likely to incur its heaviest losses. According to the survey, NDA is likely to get 35% of the vote share, down 8% from 2014. Others, mostly SP and BSP together are likely to get 53% votes, way ahead of the NDA. The UPA has gone up from 4% to 12%. A SP-BSP-Congress-RLD alliance is likely to lead to a sweep in Uttar Pradesh. This would be a huge setback for the NDA which won 73 seats in this politically crucial state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Add to this the likely post-poll support of the Left and the Trinamool Congress, Modi could get reduced to a one-term Prime Minister. Given the centrality of the BSP to the Opposition's prospects, the picture of Congress president   and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo   hugging each other during HD Kumaraswamy's swearing-in ceremony might end up being the iconic image of the Opposition against Prime Minister Modi.",2018-05-24,, CSDS Survey shows how a UPA-BSP-SP-JD(S) alliance can defeat Modi in 2019 | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/csds-survey-shows-how-a-upa-bsp-sp-jd-s-alliance-can-defeat-modi-in-2019-114546.html
291,Neeraj Thakur,"The survey clearly suggests that the Modi wave that swept the country in 2014 is no longer in place. People have begun questioning the economic policies of PM Modi and have begun to analyse whether they are benefiting from them or not. However, the Congress-led UPA is still not benefiting directly from such a scenario and over the next one year, the Opposition will have to consolidate its position through alliances with regional parties and present a real economic alternative to the Modi government.The 'Mood of the Nation (MOTN) Poll by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) has said that a large number of Indians are unhappy with the economic policies of the   government. The survey is based on interaction with 16100 people spread across 19 Indian states and Union Territories, including Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu among others. Among the many economic anxieties, the survey reveals that a large number of people in the country are worried about employment , taxes and their personal financial situation. “We find that unemployment continues to be the main concern for most voters. For the third straight MOTN survey, one in every four voters (a plurality) saw lack of jobs as the biggest problem facing the country. What’s more, nearly three in every five voters (57%) said that finding jobs in their area has become more difficult during the last 3- 4 years.” One should remember that PM Modi had come to power with a promise of generating 2 crore jobs in 5 years. Around 13 million (1.3 crore) youngsters join the queue of job-seekers in India every year. Out of these, only a few lakh are getting absorbed in the economy. The rest are either forced to opt for higher studies - a tactic to delay being seen as unemployed - or simply apply for governments jobs. Recently 2 lakh people applied for 1,137 vacancies for the position of constable in Mumbai police. Many among these applicants were reported to be holding degrees in engineering, medicine and business administration. The MOTN survey says that “ Among people who think it’s more difficult to find jobs now, only 27% were found to be voting for the BJP (overall average of the BJP is 32%); this same figure was 33% in January (BJP’s average vote share then was 34%).” Apart from unemployment, Modi government is getting unpopular due to the problems generated by Goods and Services Tax (GST). “While nearly one-fourth of the respondents (24%) had found taxes under GST to be harsh in the January round of MOTN, in the current round, this figure has jumped to more than 40%. While unavoidable changes in question placement could have had some effect on the responses received, a substantial rise such as this cannot be ignored,” says the survey. Another factor that is troubling people in the country is their concern about falling total household income. The CSDS survey says that the number of people worried about their falling incomes has has nearly doubled from 14% in January to 27% now.” The CSDS report adds “The NDA government’s claims of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas’ is no longer convincing many voters. Only 30% or three in every ten were found to be of the opinion that development has been for all sections. Back in January this figure had been much higher at 39%. On the other hand, a far greater percentage now believes that the development that was promised by the BJP in 2014 has been limited to benefiting only the rich (42% as against 36% in January).” But who benefits from rising anti-Modi sentiment? Not UPA. The rise in farm distress and the hardships experienced by traders community due to GST, seem to be benefitting regional parties more than the UPA parties, says the survey. “The NDA continues to suffer among farmers and traders, even though the benefit of their unpopularity accrues not to the UPA but to other regional players.” NDA's vote share among the farmers, has fallen by “3 percentage points since January (from 40% to 37%), while other political parties (barring UPA) have benefited with a 5-point increase (from 23% to 28%).” Similarly, the benefit of NDA’s fall among traders is also reaped by other political parties, the survey adds.  ",2018-05-24,, People across India are losing faith in Modi's economic policies: CSDS survey | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/people-across-india-are-losing-faith-in-modi-s-economic-policies-csds-survey-114547.html
292,Aditya Menon,"In the 2017 Assembly elections. BJP won four out of five Vidhan Sabha seats that constitute the Kairana Lok Sabha constituency: Nakur, Gangoh, Thana Bhawan and Shamli. The SP won one - Kairana Assembly seat - where Nahid Hasan defeated BJP's Mriganka Singh by over 21,000 votes. Mriganka is the daughter of BJP MP from Kairana Hukum Singh who died last year, necessitating the bye-poll. She is up against Nahid Hasan's mother Tabassum Hasan, contesting on an RLD ticket. If all the Opposition parties - Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress - are able to transfer their votes effectively to   candidate Tabassum Hasan, the BJP will be staring at a certain defeat in Kairana. Consider the numbers from the 2017 Assembly elections. If the SP,  , Congress and RLD effectively transfer the votes they secured in the Assembly polls last year, they would have a 19% lead over the BJP. Even in the Lok Sabha polls, in which there was a Modi wave across North India and a communal polarisation in West UP, BJP's Hukum Singh was only marginally ahead of the combined Opposition vote.   The social arithmetic, too, favours the Opposition candidate. Out of nearly 17 lakh voters in Kairana, there are 5.5 lakh Muslims, 2.5 lakh Dalits, and 1.5 lakh Jats. Together these communities account for nearly 60% of the constituency's population. The BJP is relying on about 2.5 lakh Upper Caste votes and 3.5-4 lakh votes of non-Jat OBC communities like Kashyaps, Sainis, Gujjars, Prajapatis etc.  The BJP is also additionally counting on getting a significant chunk of Jat votes, which had propelled it to victory in 2014. It is also playing the communal card in Dalit localities, hoping that the community will vote for it in the absence of active campaigning by BSP supremo  .  BJP hopes that if the communal card and Modi's campaign works, the RLD will be left with just Muslim votes and some Jat votes.   On the Opposition side, the campaign is being spearheaded by RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary, who is countering the communal polarisation by saying that the election is about ""Ganna (sugarcane) not Jinnah"".  This will be a real test for the Opposition, more than even Phulpur and Gorakhpur, where communal issues did not come in the forefront. If the Opposition can get Jats and Dalits to back a Muslim candidate in a communal hotbed like Kairana, it would mean that the BJP's Hindu coalition has decisively crumbled in UP. No wonder Modi and Adityanath are sparing no effort to prevent an Opposition victory.Prime Minister   seldom campaigns during bye-elections but the BJP appears to have made an exception for the upcoming bye-poll to the Kairana Lok Sabha constituency, giving an indication of how desperate BJP is to win the seat. Just on the eve of polling day, Modi will be holding a roadshow and a rally in Baghpat on 27 May. Baghpat is barely 70 km from Kairana. Baghpat and Kairana happen to be adjacent Lok Sabha constituencies. Knowing how BJP arranges crowds for Modi's rallies from adjoining areas, it wouldn't be surprising if part of the crowds for his rally are voters from Kairana. BJP's desperation is also evident by Chief Minister     calling Hindus to unite. ""Where was   when Sachin and Gaurav were murdered? Where was he when false cases were being registered (against Hindus). BJP will never allow such victimisation. But these people will never stop appeasing (Muslims)?"" Adityanath said at a rally on Thursday. Adityanath's desperation is understandable as he would want to avenge the defeat in the bye-poll to his own seat Gorakhpur at the hands of the   earlier this year. The reason why BJP's secret weapon Narendra Modi has been deployed to Baghpat on the eve of polling day and why Adityanath is going on Hindutva overdrive is that the arithmetic in Kairana is stacked heavily against the party.",2018-05-25,, Kairana bye-poll: BJP staring at defeat.

293,Rajeev Khanna,"Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh does not appear to be a person, at least at this point in time, who is serious about contributing to the revival of the Congress before the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls. When he led the Congress to a landslide victory in the Punjab Assembly elections in the face of a 'Modi wave', it was expected that the Grand Old Party's revival will start from Punjab through a responsible government giving a model that the party could showcase. But that has not been the case. Sigh and his party have been marred in one controversy after the other that has been sending wrong signals to the masses. Political observers point out that the Congress has managed to sit pretty until now only because people are still angry with the previous Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-  (BJP) regime and the failure of main Opposition Aam Aadmi Party ( ) to recover from its electoral drubbing last year. The chief minister reportedly chose to be away to Manali to celebrate his Pakistani friend Aroosa Alam's birthday just when the campaign was hitting the peak for the Shahkot Assembly bye-poll. Though the result would not make any difference to his government, the absence gave ample space to his political opponents. Singh was also nowhere to be seen at the grand show of Opposition unity at Bengaluru when the   (Secular)-Congress alliance was sworn in after it managed to put forces led by Prime Minister   and BJP President   on the mat.  Just ahead of the bye-polls came in the announcement of making minister  's son Karan Singh Sidhu a law officer along with several other well-connected candidates. Earlier the former cricketer's wife Navjot Kaur as made the chairperson of Punjab Warehousing Corporation. These not only drew criticism from political opponents but caused a considerable heartburn among the rank and file of the party. After considerable flak, Sidhu reportedly said his wife and son would not take up the roles. This is second major controversy over the appointments. Earlier, the Punjab government drew flak for appointing a grandson of Beant Singh as a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) on compassionate grounds 23 years after the former CM was assassinated. Rules were allegedly bent for that appointment. Beant's other grandson Ravneet Bittu is in the Lok Sabha while his son Gurkirat is a member of the legislative assembly. The government has also faced an onslaught from the Opposition over the ecological disaster in Beas river where considerable aquatic life has perished because of pollution caused by molasses released by a sugar mill. An instant and stern action from the chief minister was expected but what has followed is a delayed response. Things have become complicated with the union environment ministry too jumping in to carry out probe at its end. In a state whose name itself means 'the land of five rivers', such ecological disaster in one of those five is bound to have a political repercussion. The common folk are already pointing out that there is no difference between Singh's previous stint and the present one in terms of accessibility and the 'feudal' way of functioning. They say that they have learnt very well that 'royalty' functions in this manner. It needs to be pointed that Singh had initiated a major political gain for his party by announcing a farm loan waiver last year. Although partial in nature, he had drawn first blood by being the first CM to make such an announcement. But he has not been able to capitalise on that. In fact his the opponents are now scoring brownie points by pointing at the continuing farmer suicides and distress. Political analysts think Singh and the Congress still have about 10 months to steer public perception towards their favour ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. Many continue to believe that a Congress revival at the central level can start from Punjab. But this can be possible only by becoming proactive and accessible. The Congress still has the advantage as the anger of the masses against SAD-BJP has not cooled yet. AAP on the other hand is still far from putting its act together once again in the state that gave it four of the 13 seats in the 2014 during the Modi wave. Will Amarinder be able to deliver in 2019?

294,Atul Chandra,"Despite a Supreme Court order and notices issued by the Uttar Pradesh government's estate department, several former chief ministers of the state show no signs of vacating government bungalows they live in. Kalyan Singh and  , former CMs from the ruling  , vacated without much fuss. While the former is now the governor of Rajasthan, Rajnath is the Union home minister. But  ,   and his son Akhilesh found ways to circumvent the order. Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati agreed to shift to a new address -- 9, Mall Avenue, not far from her official 13 A Mall Avenue residence -- but refused to let go of the massive house. She converted it into a memorial for her mentor Kanshi Ram. A sign now proclaims the venue to be Shri Kanshi Ramji Yaadgaar Vishraam Sthal. Senior   leader Satish Mishra met CM   on Friday, 25 May, with a letter from Mayawati and a bunch of papers to prove that bungalow 13 A was declared a Kanshi Ram memorial on  13 January, 2011 . The government order, which was passed when Mayawati was CM, permitted her to stay in the bungalow as a “caretaker”. Mishra said Mayawati was using only a small portion in the 10-room bungalow. “As the bungalow houses Kanshi Ram’s statue and memorabilia and was officially a memorial, it cannot be allotted to anyone else,” Mishra said. He emphasised that the security and upkeep of the memorial have to be the responsibility of the government. Mayawati also has another official bungalow at 6 Mall Avenue for her security detail for which no notice has been served. “We will vacate this bungalow once we are asked to and after alternative arrangements are made for the security staff,” Mishra added. In her letter to CM Adityanath, Mayawati is reported to have said the bungalow represents the aspirations of the poor and the downtrodden, across the country. Earlier Mulayam called on the chief minister to suggest a way to retain the houses allotted to him and his son Akhilesh by virtue of being ex-chief ministers. Mulayam told the CM that the bungalows may be allotted to Ram Govind Chaudhary and Ahmad Hasan of the  . Chaudhary is the leader of the Opposition in the UP Assembly, while Hasan is the leader of Opposition in the legislative council.  Under this arrangement, they would be able to stay in their respective bungalows, Mulayam said, without realising he would still be an illegal occupant. As his letter got leaked to the media, Mulayam’s plan went kaput. Akhilesh asked for two years’ time to vacate the bungalow as he did not have a place of his own. Disputing Akhilesh’s claim, BJP spokesman Amit Puri released details of the 1A Vikramaditya Marg property owned by Akhilesh and his politician wife Dimple, as declared in their election affidavits. Mulayam owns a 3,230 square feet property in Gomtinagar’s Vishwas Khand, he said. “These are not the only properties owned by the Yadavs,” said Puri, calling their excuses specious. Another former CM who may not vacate the house is ND Tiwari. Responding to the Estate Department’s notice, his wife Ujjwala Tiwari said that her husband was in Delhi’s Max Hospital undergoing treatment for brain stroke for the last eight months. “His condition being serious, I have to be in Delhi. Moreover, he is the only freedom-fighter CM and does not own any house,” Ujjwala Tiwari said in her letter to UP CM as she requested for one year’s time from the government to vacate the house. A notice was also issued to former Public Works Department minister Ammar Rizvi who stays in 11, Gautam Palli, the house where Acharya Kripalani and his chief minister wife Sucheta Kripalani used to stay. The house is allotted in the name of Awadh Krishak Sewa Utthan Samiti.  Rizvi has sought time till the end of Ramzan for vacating the bungalow. “I am the only one paying a rent of Rs 60,000, the market rate, while others are paying less than Rs 5000,” Rizvi said, hinting at the low rents being paid by Mulayam, Mayawati and Akhilesh. He wants the house to be turned into a memorial for Acharya Kripalani. Rizvi also has to host the US ambassador to India on 6 June. “He will be the 13th US ambassador to be hosted by me,” Rizvi said. Another trust in the name of Mahatam Rai, father of former BJP MP Kusum Rai -- known to be close to Kalyan Singh, occupies an official bungalow.

296,Anurag Dey,"The BJP which prides in calling itself “the party with a difference” set the Congress led UPA regime as the benchmark for presenting a report card on the completion of four years of the  -led government at the Centre. Addressing a media conference on the occasion, BJP President   enumerated various schemes of the Modi government to assert the country to have made all-round progress including improving the lives of 22 crore families. However, while replying to a specific query on rising atrocities on Dalits and the skyrocketing fuel prices, Shah fell back on the UPA regime comparison to paint a rosy picture. “The current level prices of fuel prevailed for over three years under the Congress rule and you are perturbed in just three days,” said Shah as he also tried to assure the government was making efforts to bring the prices On the question of rising atrocities on Dalits, Shah replied: “There is no rise in Dalit atrocities under Modi regime. If you look out for statistics, you will find that atrocities on Dalits were far more rampant under the Congress rule. Villages after villages had to be vacated by the Dalits owing to attacks on them,” claimed Shah. In sharp contrast to Shah’s claims, a US 2017 report points out that attacks against Muslims and Dalits grew sharply in India under Modi. Titled the 'Constitutional and Legal Challenges Faced by Religious Minorities in India' and sponsored by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), the   says religious minority communities and Dalits face discrimination and persecution in India where hate crimes, social boycotts and forced conversion have  dramatically since 2014. Data journalism initiative Indiapsend too has   that “over the decade to 2016, crime rate against dalits rose by 25%; from 16.3 crimes per 100,000 Dalits reported in 2006”.  It not just the Opposition including the Congress that have made similar claims but even BJP lawmakers too have made such assertions. BJP MP Yashwant Singh has earlier   to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Dalit MPs like him in the ruling party are victims of atrocities against scheduled castes. The BJP president also shirked the Centre’s responsibility over Tamil Nadu Police firing that consumed 13 lives during the violent protest against Sterlite Industries' controversial plant in Thoothukudi. “Law and order is a state subject so the Centre has nothing to do. Still we have sought a report. The home minister has reacted strongly and sought a report. He has also directed that police should not open fire. The Prime Minister also has expressed concern,” said Shah on the May 22 incident. Shah in his address to the media claimed that the Modi government has fulfilled most of its promises including its twin assurances of being a pro-dalit, pro-farmer and pro-poor government and taking India to place of glory on the world map. “Under Modi we have given a transparent government which is not afraid of taking strong decisions,” said Shah claiming the Modi regime has ended many a prevailing contradictions. “It is this government which through its policies ended the tussle between whether to be pro-poor government or pro corporate. We also ended the tussle of the government either being pro-rural or pro rural through effective all-round development. This government has also established that even after satisfying all economic parameters, welfare of the masses through various social security schemes can be undertaken,” asserted Shah. On the economic front, Shah credited the Modi government for making India the “world's fifth largest economy”. Shah also used the opportunity to attack the opposition which he said was driven by the sole agenda of driving away Modi. “Under the Modi government, the country has seen a big change in the political landscape. From the late 60s’ politics of dynasty, appeasement and casteism, we have moved to the politics of performance and development. “From policy paralysis (during UPA) we have moved to politics of development where the agenda is sabka saath sabka vikas (inclusive growth),” said Shah. Continuing the attack, he accused the Opposition of resorting to “lies, repeated lies and loud lies”. “The opposition has the sole agenda of removing Modi and while the BJP under Modi wants to remove corruption and poverty and provide stability. Those who put at stake democracy for the sake of their family are now giving us sermons on democracy. “Those who jailed over one lakh innocent people durIng emergency are now talking of an environment of fear. Those who put locks on the media are now preaching about press freedom,” Shah said targeting the Congress. He claimed that the Modi government in its four years has fulfilled most of its promises. From providing electricity to every single village to giving 3.5 crore LPG connections, from building toilets in 7 crore houses to providing job opportunities to 9 crore youth under the Mudra bank scheme, the government has changed lives of 22 crore families,” claimed Shah. He also asserted of the BJP retaining power in 2019 with absolute majority. “It is Modi’s politics of development that has enabled the BJP and the NDA to be power in 20 states. 70 percent of the country’s geographical area and 65 percent of the population is under our rule,” added Shah. The BJP has also gone overboard in endorsing and canvassing the achievements of four years of Modi governments. Union ministers and BJP leaders have all taken to the social media in campaigning the what it calls the various achievements of the government. The BJP official website has come out with an   on the “4 Years Of Modi Government” detailing its achievements in various fields.

297,Joyjeet Das,"One of the key takeaways of the   (third instalment), conducted by research programme Lokniti, Delhi-based Centre for Study of Developing Societies and ABP News is the acceptability that   seems to have gained. He still lags Prime Minister  's appeal but the gap is shrinking and shrinking fast. Almost a quarter (24%) of those who took the survey spontaneously named the Congress President when asked about which leader they would prefer as the PM. Modi retained his lead, with the spontaneous preference of 34% respondents. That makes for a gap of 10 percentage points, much lower than the 17 pp gap between the two as seen in the second instalment of the study only five months ago. In January, 20% of the sample population had rooted for Gandi and 37% for the current PM.  Support for other leaders, most notably West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo  , remained more or less the same. In one aspect Gandhi actually trumped Modi: While both were liked by 43% respondents, Modi was disliked by 36% and Gandhi by 32%. That makes him a net gainer over Modi. He converted more haters into likers too: 29% compared with Modi's 25%. Also, he lost fewer likers – 35% of those who disliked Modi said they earlier liked him. For Gandhi, the figure was 22%. Notably, a year ago only 9% had named Gandhi. Clearly, he has come a long way in this one year.  In fact political watchers have keenly followed a sort of a transformation in the 47-year-old. Gone are the days when he would be ridiculed as 'Pappu', carrying the baggage of incumbency of a decade-long   government. Modi would tear him and mother Sonia apart at political rallies referring to his 'silver spoon' entitlements. There was a time when his vibes were interpreted as of that of a 'reluctant prince', like his father, former PM Rajeev Gandhi, was once talked about. After the results for the 2014 General Elections became clear, Rahul came for an evening press conference laughing, leaving political watchers bewildered. Congress-led United Progressive Alliance had been throughly trashed in the polls. His image didn't improve in the next couple of years, as was the case with the Grand Old Party's political performance. The only succour was a victory in Bihar as part of the Grand Alliance with the Rashtriya   and Janata Dal (United). Meanwhile he would disappear from the scene, drawing ridicule from political opponents. Loyalty within his party did not disappear though. Early last year he came across as a more keen participant in the political firmamment during elections to the Assemblies of a handful of states. Congress won in Punjab, largely thanks to the leadership of current chief minister Amarinder Singh but lackadaisically let go of opportunities to form government in Goa and Manipur. What was noticed was, however, the way Rahul reached out to   leader and then CM   in Uttar Pradesh. Eventually UP was won by the  , but Rahul succeeded in creating a bond with Akhilesh, three years his junior. Congress shed some of its ennui when it fought tooth and nail to retain Ahmed Patel's Rajya Sabha seat from Gujarat last August. Rahul faced flak again when he left for Italy. But ever since his image has only improved: He cut an impressive figure at an interaction at University of California, Berkeley and kept the tempo going once back home – taking a keener interest in rejigging the party in order to bring back “inner-party democracy”. On the other hand, another interesting show unfolded in the virual sphere, thanks to a young and vibrant social media team led by Divya Spandana. Instead of getting trolled all the time, Team Rahul started giving it back as good as it came. On Twitter, @OfficeOfRG changed to a more personal @RahulGandhi, comunications improved underscored by a nonchalance perhaps best showcased when he introduced his pet dog Pidi. A new, more confident Rahul had unmistakenly took the stage. And twitterati seemed to like it, driving up his follower count. It's currently at 6.9 million – still way behind Modi's 42.6 million, but increasing every day as are the 'likes', which now often overshadow the PM's count. Towards the end of last year he dived headlong into the Gujarat Assembly elections, touring the state extensively, putting up a frontal attack on the incumbent BJP government and promoting young 'uns be it from within Congress (Alpesh Thakore) or from outside ( , Jignesh Mevani). The hardwork paid off. Nobody thought the Congress to oust the BJP in the PM's backyard, but the results were way closer than expected – BJP stopped at 99, with Congress only 22 seats behind. By the time the results were out Rahul had assumed the office of party chief. In March this year he stamped his authority on the party at its two-day plenary, ramping up the offensive against the incumbent government. The recently concluded Karnataka elections saw him take charge, touring the state extensively, trying to set an agenda without stepping into distractions put up the the BJP. The Congress lost, but ensured that the BJP would be kept out of power by swift coalition politics – an 180-degree turn of the image it put across in Goa and Manipur last year. His work is likely to only intensify with elections lined up in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, building up the crescendo to next year's general elections. The image makeover would surely come in handy. The survey released Thursday too indicates that his sustained stands on issues related to the marginalised sections of the society were paying off. Among Dalit respondents, 25% preferred Rahul as the next PM, up from 18% five months ago. That ties with Modi's ratings among the community, which in fact has shrunk from 35%. Among Adivasis, Rahul's acceptability was even higher – 30%, up from 27%. Modi, on the other hand, dropped to 37% from 42%. If these trends continue along with the new-found bonhomie among Opposition parties, PM Modi should start worrying.

298,Neeraj Thakur," Four years is not a long time in the history of a nation that came into being 70 years ago. But for a politician who came to power negating all the achievements of previous governments, every passing month calls for scrutiny of the change that he had promised in the run up to the elections. On 26 May, Prime Minister   will have completed 48 out of 60 months of the mandate that he received from the people of the country. He had made a number of promises through his party's political manifesto and outside of it. How many of his promises have fructified or are likely to come true by the time his government? Let's take a look. BJP's election manifesto for 2014 was divided into 5 parts, with a focus on job creation, black money, improving centre-state relations, good governance, meeting aspirations of neo-middle class. 1) Job creation: It is no secret that the government has failed to create jobs for the youth. While Modi had promised to create 2 crore jobs in five years (At many places he even promised 1 crore jobs every year). But in Modi's own words, that dream is no longer possible. But he did not concede his failure in straightforward words. He rather asked people to be entrepreneurs - not the modern day, e-commerce stalwart types, who make headlines in financial papers every day, but the old traditional ones who are seen around every nook and corner of our cities. They are the Paanwalas (betel leaf sellers) and the Pakodawalas (Fritter sellers). The idea may seem like a cruel joke to the aspirational youth of the world's soon to be youngest nation, but that is a reality that millions of young Indians have to deal with at a time when countries like US, Singapore and even Australia have begun to filter Indian engineers for IT sector jobs and the much hyped Make in India campaign has failed to create jobs within the country. Score Card: 3/10  2) Electricity for all: Electricity for all was not a new dream for India. For over a decade India had been trying to achieve the goal with delayed deadlines. But Modi government did actually meet the target. On 28 April, 2018, Modi took to Twitter to announce that every village in India was electrified. But electrifying every village of India was sort of a relay race in which Modi was the last runner to take the baton and run to the finish line. The previous. When Modi took office in 2014, out of around six lakh, only 18,400 villages were without electricity. According to an analysis by  , between 2005 and 2014, the UPA-I and UPA-II governments connected over 1,082,280 villages to the grid and over 20 million households, were provided electricity connections. But the problem under the UPA regime was the criteria for recognizing a village as electrified. According to that criteria, a village with just 10% of electrified homes would be considered electrified. Therefore, when Modi in his electoral promise told people that every Indian will get electricity at his home within 60 days, people from villages voted for his party in huge numbers. But Modi, knowing it well that he will start his tenure at the finish line, chose not to change the criteria for electrification to 100% household and just ran to the finishing line to take the award. Due to this, despite 100% electrification of villages on papers, as many as 31 million households are still without electricity. Score Card: 4/10 3) Clean Ganga- India is one of the most polluted countries in the world. Its rivers are one of the dirtiest. But instead of adopting a holistic agenda to cut down pollution, Modi chose only river Ganga for his river cleaning mission. It was done because of the religious importance of this river for 80% of the country's population, making it an important electoral pitch to garner votes. Unfortunately, even after spending crores on the cleaning exercise, there is not an iota of improvement in the pollution levels of the river Ganga. Though one would laud the fact that Modi allocated a seperate minister for the project but despite a change of guard in the ministry that oversees clean Ganga project, (Uma Bharti has been replaced by  ) the hope of seeing India's longest river clean is a pipe dream Score: 1/10  4) Black money and corruption: Modi government was supposed to bring back all the black money stashed abroad within 100 days of coming to power. While nothing of that sort happened within 100 days, but in November 2016, the policy decision of demonetising Indian currency to fight black money backfired. The Indian economy is still struggling with the policies' aftershocks and nobody knows how much black money was unearthed through demonetisation. But, one can't totally negate the government's attempt to nail the black money hoarders. The Goods and Services Tax introduced by the government tries to check the cash and without bill dealings by traders. But, to say that GST will eradicate black economy completely would be really naïve. Score: 5/10  5) Swach Bharat Abhiyan: Cleanliness is one area where India lagged before Modi came to power. Previous governments did try to abolish open defecation in rural areas, but due to cultural issues, the task was always daunting. But Modi government has worked on the idea of making India an open-defecation free relentlessly and its results would be visible in the form of good health of Children in the age group of 3-12 years, who are most susceptible to diseases like typhoid, cholera and Jaundice due to the habit of open defecation.

299,Anup  Dutta,"A few days after Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath indicated an alliance with “like-minded” parties for the upcoming Assembly elections, the   and Bahujan Samaj Party have begun making forays into the state. “We’ll go for alliances with like-minded parties in 2018, keeping the broader picture of the Lok Sabha polls in mind. Abhi hamne charcha kisi se shuroo nahi ki hai, abhi mai sabki rai le raha hoon, ki kiske saath kis tarah ka samjhauta kiya jaye. (We’re yet to begin formal discussions with any other party for possible alliance in MP. I’m still consulting everyone about what kind of alliances need to be struck with whom),” MP Congress Committee president Kamal Nath told media persons. Nath decided to adopt a fresh electoral strategy after the Karnataka Assembly election result that saw the Congress tally falling from 122 in 2013 to 78, even though its vote share increased marginally. He is siad to have recognised the importance of consolidating anti-BJP votes. “In 2014, BJP got 31% votes and claimed that they had the mandate of the people. We don’t want the Opposition vote to be split this time. We’ll soon start discussions with other like-minded parties on alliance for 2018 (polls) keeping in mind the 2019 Lok Sabha polls,” he added. The Congress is said to be collecting information about the seats where they should go for an alliance with like-minded parties in MP. Nath’s announcement at an alliance with ""like-minded parties"" for the Assembly elections in November drew attention from Samajwadi Party. SP supremo   made a three-day visit to the State. He toured extensively the areas bordering Uttar Pradesh from Bundelkhand to Vindhya region, considered largely to be a Congress territory. He addressed the public in Sidhi and Satna districts of Vindhya region, besides Khajuraho in the Chhattarpur district of Bundelkhand. His visit surprised everyone, when Akhilesh inducted a nephew and niece of late Arjun Singh at Semaria in Sidhi district. Sidhi district used to be Arjun Singh’s stronghold. Currently, his son Ajay Singh “Rahul Bhaiya” is a five-time Congress MLA from the district’s Churhat Assembly constituency and leader of Opposition in the State Assembly. However, during Akhilesh’s visit to Sidhi, Arjun’s nephew Bhunwar KK Singh and his niece Vandana Kumari Singh joined the Samajwadi Party. Bhunwar once a Congress party leader of the district, had migrated to the BJP. According to Congress sources, the relationship between Bhunwar KK Singh and Ajay Singh has not been particularly cordial. KK Singh had earlier been with the Congress and then shifted to the BJP.  state president Narmada Prasad Ahirwar has denied any speculation of an alliance. “We are going to contest all the 230 Assembly seats in the state,” Ahirwar said. The BSP has never been a deciding factor in MP, though it can play spoiler in a number of seats. Its highest tally was in 1998, when it got 11 seats. It won four seats in the 2013 Assembly polls. The SP and the Gondwana Gantantra Party didn't win a single seat but ended up helping the BJP grab at least 53 seats, because of a division in Opposition votes.

301,Sulagna Sengupta,"With the West Bengal Panchayat elections still mired in uncertainty, the State Election Commission decided to move the Supreme Court on Wednesday. In the entire row, the role of the state election commissioner Amarendra Kumar Singh has come under criticism from the Opposition. The Opposition parties as well as political analysts have compared Singh's role with that of former election commissioner Meera Pandey, who handled the Panchayat election of 2013. Pandey is said to have refused to give in to the state government and even moved the court on the deployment of Central forces. Contrary to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's wishes, Pandey wanted the elections to be held in multiple phases under the supervision of central security forces. A war of words followed and Pandey went to court. The court went with the SEC. According to Amol Mukherjee, former principal of Presidency College, Pandey’s precise knowledge of the Constitution meant the she knew what she was doing when she challenged the state government and moved to the Supreme Court for deployment of Central forces during the Panchayat election. But Singh is totally dependent on state government and he cannot take any decision on his own that will save the face of both the state government and SEC. As a result, the Commission is facing legal hassles. Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, who approached the Calcutta High Court for the CPI(M), said “ The State Election Commissioner is acting according to the whims and fancies of the state government . This is undesirable. In 2013, Pandey was at loggerheads with the state government and she moved the Supreme Court regarding deployment of Central forces in the rural elections. She knew the constitutional obligations very well unlike the present Commissioner and never tried to draw the attention of any senior minister or even top bureaucrats. She didn't aspire for any top post but worked as a silent and sincere officer, who never shirked from her responsibilities.” Imankalyan Lahiri, professor of International Relations Jadavpur University said, “We are witnessing such a situation for the first time in which the state election commission is facing a series of Court verdict five days ahead of the scheduled date of election. Voters are still in the dark on whether elections will be held as per schedule. This has happened primarily because the state election commissioner has failed to discharge his duties properly. Remembering Pandey's tenure, Lahiri said “Pande had shown great courage during her tenure as the state election commissioner and succeeded in providing a level playing field for all the parties”. In his defence, Singh said “ It’s not right to comment anything about my predecessor. But I can say that I have not received any threat from the ruling political party or from Opposition parties during the poll process. I am just trying to discharge my duties properly.” On the other hand, Pandey said “It’s unfortunate that so many people have been killed during filing of nominations. I feel that the duty of the state election commissioner is to provide a level playing field to all the parties and discharge duties accordingly.” A Kolkata resident, Pandey was born on 22 July, 1949 and studied at the city's Loreto House school. She did her post-graduation in English from Jadavpur University.

302,Rajeev Khanna,"With politics gathering steam in Haryana, the key political players are engrossed in playing water games this summer. The state faces water scarcity and the politicians have chosen the onset of summers to indulge in issues related to water. The Opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) set the tone for a war on water issues last month when it announced a 'Jail Bharo' agitation from 1 May along with its new found pre-poll political ally, the Bahujan Samaj Party ( ). The INLD has been trying to build up a narrative around the completion of the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue for almost a year now, particularly since it's 'ally' the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) was voted out of power in Punjab. The INLD drew the first blood by launching the 'Jail Bharo' agitation targeting both the   (BJP) regimes in both the state and the Centre along with the Congress that is in power in Punjab for not allowing Haryana to get its share of river waters of Punjab. This has compelled both the ruling BJP government in the state under Manohar Lal Khattar as well as the Congress party to join issues in their own ways. Last week, Khattar gave a new dimension to the issue by asking the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab to join hands in checking the wasteful flow of Ravi waters to Pakistan while keeping in view the unprecedented water crisis that looms large before both the states of Haryana and Punjab. He informed that he has written a letter to his Punjab counterpart Amarinder to direct his concerned officers to take up the proposal in right earnest. The letter states, “You must have noticed reports about an unprecedented water crisis that looms large before our states. More and more blocks of Haryana and Punjab have anyway been slipping into the category of over exploited blocks even as our hardworking farmers toil in the face of a stressed farm sector. I think that time has come when we must join hands in checking the wasteful flow of Ravi waters to Pakistan.” It further said, “ You may perhaps be aware that the sixth meeting of the committee formed by government of India in this regard was held by the Central Water Commission, New Delhi on April 24, 2012. It had assessed the quantum of Minimum Utilisable Water (MUW) as 32 cumecs (equivalent to 0.58 Million Acre Feet) on a sustainable basis. The Committee decided that the proposal for its diversion by constructing a 2.0 metre to 2.5 metre high diversion weir structure across river Ravi with a gravity flow canal off-taking from Dharamkot to Harike head works was viable. The Committee also opined that any other techno-economically superior alternative that would minimise the problem of implementation of the scheme may be carried out during preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) based on actual survey and investigation by an agency to be decided separately at an appropriate forum.” The letter says that the government of India had accordingly asked all the partner states to build consensus on engaging the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) to undertake feasibility studies and to construct the above project and that government of Punjab may take follow-up action on the minutes of meeting. Khattar's letter says that it is indeed unfortunate that there has been no visible progress on the issue so far and the ever so precious water is still going to Pakistan. This enormous national wastage of water needs to be stopped immediately. Being divertible, this water should instead be utilised for the benefits of the people of the partner states. The letter requests Amarinder to direct his concerned officers to take up the proposal in right earnest. “I have directed our chief secretary and principal secretary, Department of Irrigation and Water Resources to accord 'top priority' to this. They shall make it convenient to attend any meeting that your officers may consider necessary on the subject so as to ensure expeditious implementation of this proposal which has already been declared as national project by the government of India,” it says. Showing his deft political skills Amarinder has responded by urging the centre to take the lead in ensuring optimum harnessing of the Ravi-Beas waters while suggesting constitution of a technical panel of experts to work out ways to restrict the flow of water from Punjab into Pakistan. During a briefing on Monday, he said that he had not yet received the letter purported to have been written by his Haryana counterpart but made it clear that his government would take every possible step secure more water for the state. Pointing out that melting of ice leads to rise in the water levels in the three rivers of Ravi, Beas and Satluj, causing it to flow into Pakistan, Amarinder said he has written to union water resources minister   suggesting storage of the excess water in dams in Himachal Pradesh to check its flow into Pakistan. He has further suggested that all the stored water be controlled in Himachal Pradesh. Amarinder also claims to have stressed upon the need for the central government to take the initiative in the matter. According to a Punjab government spokespersons it needs to be noted that under the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, India has been allowed unrestricted usage of available water in Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. Significant quantum of water of Ravi is flowing across the international border through tributaries like Ujh, Jallialia, Tarna etc. joining the Ravi downstream of the rim station at Madhopur. The quantity of water of Ravi flowing across the international border is assessed to be 0.58 million acre feet (MAF). In 2015, the Punjab government submitted a report giving two alternatives to utilise this water. The spokesperson further said that a high powered steering committee for implementation of national projects what is chaired by secretary (Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation) constituted a team comprising officers of Central Water Commission and Irrigation Department of the union government on March 3, 2017 to visit the site of proposed second Ravi Beas Link Project and submit a feasibility report. The team visited the site on December 5, 2017 and observed that harnessing the waters of Ravi is in national interest, and from among Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers, the greatest scope for utilisation of unharnessed waters is in Ravi and technical feasibility of transfer of water from Ravi to Beas needs to be ascertained. Earlier in March, Union water resources minister Nitin Gadkari had reportedly said the central government has decided to solve the water problems in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan by utilising water from rivers flowing into Pakistan. At local level former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has been accusing both the INLD and the BJP of failing to get the SYL canal project executed. He has also been scathing in his attack on the Khattar government for shelving the Dadupur-Nalvi canal project after more than Rs 3000 crore was spent on it. The scheme was initiated in 1985 and the project was approved by the state government for Rs 13 crore for irrigation and recharging of ground water in Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra and Ambala districts. For implementing the scheme, 190.67 acre land was acquired between 1987 and 1990. But nothing more was done. There is also the general perception that had Prime Minister   been as strong as former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, he could have got the state governments of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan to sign a dotted line on providing river water share to Haryana. Till 2016 year it was the SAD-BJP combine that was in power in Punjab while his own party has been in power in Rajasthan and Haryana. With Haryana state Assembly polls scheduled to follow the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the water games are expected to intensify in the political games in the days to come.",2018-05-10,, Haryana in poll mode: parties play water games to garner votes | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/haryana-in-poll-mode-parties-play-water-games-to-garner-votes-112511.html
303,Sebastian Sunny,"WMBD 2018 is significant again, as it is for the first time that two major bird conservation days, the International Migratory Bird Day and the World Migratory Bird Day, have been combined. This was decided in October last year at the Convention of Migratory Species (CMS COP 12), held at the Philippines capital, Manila. The new partnership, it has been said, is a “bid to strengthen global recognition and appreciation of migratory birds and highlight the urgent need for their conservation”. It has also been decided that WMBD will be observed again in the year on the second Saturday in October. The activities of these days would focus on education on migratory birds and spreading awareness about the need to protect their habitats and flyways. As many as 2000 species of birds, that is 20 per cent of all known bird species, make regular seasonal movements. Migration is an activity akin to both humans and animals. Bird migration is a regular seasonal movement, along the flyways and between the breeding and wintering grounds. There are many states identified with bird migration and Rajasthan used to be known for the winter sojourns of the rare Siberian cranes in the Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur every year till the turn of the century. Other well known winter  migrants include the highly threatened Yellow breasted bunting, Amur falcon, Sociable lapwing, Blackpoll warbler, Rufous hummingbird, Ruff, Black winged stilt, Common teal, Common green shank, Northern pintail, Yellow wagtail, White wagtail, Rosy pelican, Gadwall, Wood sandpiper, Spotted sandpiper, Eurasian Wigeon, Black tailed godwit, Blue throat, Long billed pipit and Starling. Among the summer migrants are Asian koel, Black crowned night heron, Eurasian golden oriole, Comb duck, Blue cheeked bee eater, Blue tailed bee eater and Cuckoos. Demoiselle cranes, popularly called 'kurja', come to India from Mongolia.  The Red Knot is an iconic American species which travels nearly 14000 kms each spring from the base of Argentina to Canadian Arctic in order to breed. At the turn of the century over 50,000 Red Knots wintered at Tierra del Fuego in Argentina. Aerial surveys in 2017 indicated a disturbing development about their population—there were fewer than 9,000 of them, an all time low.      Birds are categories into “local” and “migratory” going by their habitats, movement and breeding locations. ”Do remember, this is a mistake often committed by most people, including the press reporters. Migratory birds are those which do not breed in places of their migration. As for those migrating to India they may breed over the Himalayas, in Tibet/Ladakh, or North West Frontier areas in Pakistan and Afghanistan or further up in Siberia or China or Mongolia”, observes eminent conservationist Harsh Vardhan. Migration is beset with perils for the birds. Bird migration, driven by weather conditions and food availability, carries high cost of predation and mortality. The migratory birds face threats from poachers and degradation of flyways and habitats along the route. The loss of critical stopover sites such as coastal wetlands, marshes, illegal killing, poisoning, tourism and poor waste management are some of the aspects endangering their lives. According to Birdlife International more than 40 per cent of the migratory birds are declining and nearly 200 are now classified as threatened.  “Birds are doing their best to find ways to live among people, but they are birds after all—they don’t know how to navigate human dominated landscapes,” points out David Yarnold of the Birdlife USA. In these perilous times for migratory birds, how to keep a track on their flyways, habitats and their well being through the journeys, at times involving thousands of kilometers?  “Bird banding or ringing is the most ideal tool to ascertain which bird migrated to which destination and took how many days to do so. This scientific procedure reveals status of any species, declining or being all right. It is done all over the world,” Harsh Vardhan notes. However, sadly in India it is not being carried out. “The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) is the sole agency to do it. It is neither doing itself nor allowing others to do so. Can we amend the current practice to enable young bird watchers join this work? It can be an exciting new profession for many,” he argues.     May 12 is World Migratory Bird Day (WMBD). In fact, the day that follows, May 13 also is part of the WMBD. This year WMBD is important for more than one reason. The first and the foremost is that this year the focus is on unifying the planet’s major bird corridors or flyways—the African Eurasian Flyway, the East Asian-Australasian Flyway and the American Flyway. The WMBD 2018 has “Unifying our voices for bird conservation” as its theme.",2018-05-12,, World Migratory Bird Day  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/world/world-migratory-bird-day-a-clarion-call-for-conservation-112782.html
304,Joyjeet Das,"If Gujarat was a good start, Rahul Gandhi's Karnataka campaign has seen him mature. It was about time too, considering he now heads the Grand Ol' Party. Thursday saw more of that mature Gandhi who went for his bete noire from the word go and didn't lose composure even in the face of googlies from seasoned journalists. “We have a manifesto” he said, “that Mr Veerappa Moily has made after talking to thousands of people and taking the essence of what they want. The BJP, on the other hand, did a closed-door excercise and copied half of what we said.” In effect he laid down a trap in which Amit Shah, the saffron party's national president, walked straight into later in the day when he filled his speech with promises from the BJP's manifesto – smartphones, free laptops, a 'Valmiki scheme' for the scheduled tribes (ST) or a 'Babu Jagjivan' scheme for the scheduled castes (SC), schemes for betel nut growers, coconut planters, an annual international coffee meet at Chikkamagaluru, etc. Rahul Gandhi actually became recorrent at Amit Shah's press meet, even while physically absent, thanks to a volley of questions. Shah played most of them down, but the irritation was palpable – the show of nonchalance was coming at an effort, and at times the nonchalance was bordering on arrogance. The emotion is not new when you talk of the man who Prime Minister   perhaps trusts the most. A day earlier his irritation and arrogance was in full public view at a campaign rally in Shanthinagara constituency. Over enthusistic organisers had hired a group of drummers, another troupe of dancing kettle drummers dressed in indigineous costumes plus a DJ. Needless to say, all that in a narrow lane of Jogupalya created considerable din. “Twice he said 'DJ bandh karo' (stop the DJ) after starting his speech atop his campaign bus. When the noise didn't stop he simply stopped his speech, palmed off the mic to the candidate standing next to him and walked way to inside the bus. When someone approached him with a garland he just brushed it aside,” said an eye witness. Arrogance probably does seep in with success. And Amit Shah has been successful, at least going by his track records in elections which he has won one after the other for his party. Of late though that chariot of victory has hit a few speedbreakers – 'humps' as they call them in Namma City. Rahul Gandhi threatens to make Karnataka a big such hump, going by his recent form. Thursday morning he alleged that the BJP is interested in personal attacks alone and then launched into a scathing attack of his own: * The Rafale deal has benefitted the PM and his 'friends' at the cost of jobs for the youth of Karnataka. * Dalits are at a risk under BJP regimes, as are women. * PM Modi loves discussing sea-planes and bullet trains, not debt wiavers for farmers (in respnse, Shah ended up promising waiver of up to Rs 1 lakh within 10 days of forming a government if voted to power). * The corrupt image of BJP's CM candidate BS Yeddyurappa and others like the Reddy Bros and B Sreeramulu (again, Shah had to come in defence of BSY) * India's foreign policy being “decimatd” – cases in point being China, Nepal and Maldives; Russian arms for Pakistan – thanks to Modi's “one-man show” * Ever-increasing fuel prices despite falling crude prices (when this reporter tried to get a response from  , a visibly irritated Union Minister for Railways and Coal asked “Why can't Mr Siddaramaiah reduce tax?”) When questions threatened to veer into his personal space too, he tackled them with elan and then turned them onto Modi. “My mother is Italian by birth, but has lived here for most of her life and is more Indian than many Indians I know,” he said. On his recent 'temple run', he said he has been visiting places of worship of all faiths for 15 years and it always make BJP uncomfortable. The man, who just a couple of days ago said he could be the next PM, said the current one has anger for everybody. “I am a lightening rod of that anger. I attract that anger because he sees a threat from me. But his anger is his problem,” said Gandhi – a far cry from his listless self in the face of Modi's diatribe five years ago in the same city this correspondent had seen. This time 'round, while being respectful respectful to his chief minister Siddaramaiah, Gandhi tried to set the agenda – not respond to it: “It is a fight between the spirit of Karnataka and the RSS,” he said in an unusual departure, drawing the   – the BJP's ideological fountainhead – right into the middle of the hubbub. “The RSS is trying to take away your state. It is attacking your Basavanna, your culture, your language, your food,” he said quite in line with the pro-Kannadiga, pro-Lingayat image that Siddaramaiah has been projecting.     If Gandhi came across as stepping on the gas and Shah seemed to be self-assured despite his irritation, it is not without reason. That reason is Narendra Modi. A senior journalist who has logged miles after strenous miles across Karnataka in the last three months said: “Things have swung quite a bit to the BJP's favour in the last one week”. Modi started his campaign on 1 May, drew in crowds by the drove and addressed way more eallies he was scheduled to. Congress has reasons to be wary: While it emerged victorious in the 2013 Assembly elections, the 'Modi Wave' of 2014 blew that lead away. “Even in places away from the big cities people have been saying that Modi's government has done things,” the journalist said. “Not that Siddaramaiah hasn't – his has been a good government with useful subsidies and peaceful environment. But the BJP knows how to go about elections; how to rake up issues,” said Cheenappa, a local. “The Congress regime was peaceful – unlike the troubled times in north Indian states,” said Moeen (name changed), who drives an auto rickshaw. But the party may lose votes this time, he said citing the advent of the Muslim Empowerment Party (which he sounds convinced has been floated by the BJP). “ 's support to JD (S) may also cost Congress votes,” he said. Though CM Siddaramaiah has sounded confident about his move to root for a separate religion for Lingayats, that has not gone down well with everyone. “It will be a sweep for the BJP. The Congress has tried to drive a wedge between the Lingayats and Veera-Shaivas,” claimed another local who did not wish to be named. Even the opinion polls have come across as playing it safe. No wonder that in such a situation, even the JD (S) is not being discounted. “See, both the Congress and the BJP are equally poised. So is the JD (S). If they do well, ultimately it may boil down to who HD Kumaraswamy backs,” said Manjunatha (name changed) in Malleswaram, giving credence to the theory of 'kingmaker JD (S)' – a party that has successfully kept its Vokkaliga voters together, especially in the Old Mysore region, over the years. Party patriarch and former PM HD Deve Gowda has publicly declared that he would disown son Kumaraswamy if he rallies witht the BJP after the elections. But that has not laid all doubts to rest. “He has supported the BJP earlier; can do the same again,” said Moeen. The fact that the Bahujan Samaj Party of  , a known BJP baiter, has tied up with JD (S), is not enough for him. Even Siddaramaiah has hinted at a tacit understanding between the Janata splinter and the BJP. On Thursday both Gandhi and Shah reiterated that their respective parties would handsomely win: Shah predicted at least 130 members in the 224-strong Assembly and there would be no need to give or take support, Gandhi claimed his party would win and Modi would lose not only in Karnataka, but also in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and eventually in 2019. But then claims will be claims and both scenarios can't come true simultaneously. In reality, if the scale is as finely balanced as Manjunatha claimed, then giving and taking support might be the only option to consider. Stakes will remain high as whoever does get the chair will also be at a psychological advantage in the state's Lok Sabha constituencies next year. Fun fact: No Karnataka CM has been voted back to power since Ramakrishna Hegde in 1985; nobody has been able to complete two consecutive terms. Will that change after the counting of votes on 15 May?  Bangalore came across unusually calm for the capital of a state going to polls in two days: citizens going on about with their day-to-day life, techies swarming into their respective 'tech parks', magnum size posters promoting this Friday's big releases, shoppers milling around ignoring the afternoon sun – none of them caring to discuss too much about which party will take hold of the state's reins for the next five years, even over the countless tumblers of filter 'kaapi' exchanging hands. It seems a little strange, especially after the hurly-burly of elections in many other states. Take West Bengal, for example, which has been a bundle of nerves for more than a month now over a pack of Panchayat elections. Is this indifference? It may come across as so. That perhaps kept the big parties on their toes on the last day of campaining. The presidents of both the   and the   (BJP) in fact decided to meet the press presumably to make their points one last time and to “happily” take questions. Yes, the   (Secular) didn't look that active, but anybody writing it off at this stage will do so at own peril.  ",2018-05-11,," Karnataka polls: Uneven silence among voters as evenly poised Cong, BJP make last ditch efforts | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/karnataka-polls-uneven-silence-among-voters-as-evenly-poised-cong-bjp-make-last-ditch-efforts-112559.html
305,Sulagna Sengupta,"In what can be seen as a blow to Congress President  's prospects as the Prime Ministerial candidates of a united Opposition, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee hinted that she is not keen on working as an ally of a Congress-led alliance. At an interview to a regional channel, Banerjee said, “I do not feel that Congress can get a majority in the general elections. It is also true that regional parties are also becoming stronger. I am not aware whether other regional parties like TRS, BJD or NCP share a good rapport with the Congress or not”. When asked specifically about Rahul Gandhi expressing his desire to by Prime Minister, Banerjee said, “It is always correct to express one's party’s opinion. I do not see anything wrong in it. But in the present situation, it seems that although the Congress is the largest Opposition party, it is not in a position to get a majority on its own”. On being asked about he own ambitions, she said, “My only mission is to bring all anti-BJP parties under one umbrella. I will be glad if I could do something for the benefit of the country. But I do not have any desire to lead any federal front.” While Banerjee said she has good relations with  , she also criticised the Congress for “acting unilaterally” as the Opposition. “ In Parliament we fight collectively. But when the Congress moved the impeachment motion, we said that this would not work. But the Congress went ahead with their plan. They should remember that regional parties are important.” Political observers see Banerjee's comments as being reflective of her reluctance to join the Congress bandwagon at this juncture. Imankalyan Lahiri , professor of International Relations Jadavpur University, said “It’s clear from Banerjee’s interview that she is not willing to work as an ally of the Rahul Gandhi-led Congress. Congress can't get a majority on its own and will need to ally with some regional parties. Her position on the Congress' impeachment motion against the Chief Justice indicates that Banerjee will prefer to strengthen an alliance of regional parties rather than become a Congress ally”. Another political analyst Suparna Moitra says that, “Banerjee wants to keep all options open for strengthening a federal front. It also indicated that the Congress will have to work harder to win the support of regional parties”.",2018-05-12,, Mamata Banerjee not keen to become a junior partner of Rahul Gandhi's Congress | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/mamata-banerjee-not-keen-to-become-a-junior-partner-of-rahul-gandhi-s-congress-112773.html
306,Rajeev Khanna,"Chief Ministers heading   (BJP) governments in various states seem to be taking the much peddled ‘Modi Model’ a bit too far. They are too engrossed in following whatever Prime Minister   has been doing in his earlier avatar as the Gujarat Chief Minister and now as the Prime Minister of the country. It is a well known fact by now that Modi leaves no occasion or event to garner positive press coverage for himself in his quest to develop himself as a brand even though the event might be of little or no consequence or something that is too personal a matter. Now it is the CMs who have started speaking his language on every occasion. This phenomenon can be best highlighted by the Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat’s drive for publicity. One just needs to sample the brief press note that the state’s information department circulated on Sunday night that had the headline, 'Within an hour of complaint on CM’s Uttarakhand Mobile App, help provided for the cremation of cow' The press note then went on to read, “On a complaint lodged on Uttarakhand CM’s Mobile App at 5 pm on 12 May, the Chief Minister’s office got information that a cow has died in Gaushala of Amit Singh at Kartar Dairy Farm Missarwala Kala, Doiwala but on account of second-Saturday holiday, they did not got any assistance for the cremation of the cow and next day as well, the offices were supposed to remain closed because of Sunday. “After making hectic efforts the whole day, Amit Singh lodged a complaint seeking help on the CM Uttarakhand Mobile App on May 12 at 5 pm. Acting promptly for the redressal of the complaint, ADM, Dehradun and Doiwala police were intimated. After receiving information from CM’s office, police and administrative officials reached Amit Singh’s Gaushala within an hour and got the cow cremated. Amit Singh has thanked the Uttarakhand Chief Minister. Trivendra Singh Rawat and Dehradun district administration and Doiwala police.” One can see that things have come to a pass that ‘cremation’ of a cow has also become an event of sorts to get publicity. Just the day before, Rawat’s publicity wing was circulating media briefs on how he remembered his mother Late Bodha Devi with the message that every mother loves the youngest child the most and being the youngest in the family, he was showered with utmost love and affection. He added that whenever he had wished to go for his studies, social or political works, his parents always encouraged him. He said whatever he has achieved or whatever position he has reached was only due to his parents. Rawat said where ever he stayed, he used to get time to meet his mother and spent time with his parents. Now is it not similar to what Modi has been doing using the pictures of his mother at various occasions including the demonetisation fallout. The media has been too keen to show his picture taking his mother around and her also travelling in an auto. If he can indulge in such publicity gimmicks, why can’t the likes of Rawat. On the occasion of the ‘Mother’s Day’ he even sent out a public address to the mothers that was more of a preaching. The message read, “It is being said that mother and motherland are great than the heaven and I feel myself very fortunate that with your love and blessings, I got the privilege to serve you both. The respect with which I served my mother, with same feelings, I am committed to serve my motherland Uttarakhand.” Observers have been pointing that his entire political narrative is around ‘Modi’s dreams’ that he has been trying to fulfill. “The whole narrative of the ‘Double Engine Sarkar’ where the same party is in power in both the state and the centre is being played to the hilt. The fact is that the government is yet to come out with some concrete achievement to show. The issues on which this government was elected to power remain unresolved. Political posturing and rhetoric is being dished out continuously while a huge effort is being made to build a positive image through media,” said a senior political adviser. What is on display is making the ‘Modi Model’ work all across where hype and hoopla overshadow the actual performance. Uttarakhand seems to be following this model in all earnestness.",2018-05-14,, How BJP CMs are taking the 'Modi Model' of branding a bit too far | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/how-bjp-cms-are-taking-the-modi-model-of-branding-a-bit-too-far-113031.html
307,Anurag Dey,"  With the Karnataka polls now over, the BJP which is perennially on election mode now has shifted its focus on Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh where polls are slated later in the year and of course the grand battle in 2019. Presided over by party president  , BJP office bearers and state party presidents brain-stormed over the upcoming elections and the future course of action in Karnataka where most of the exit polls have predicted a hung assembly. The results for the Assembly elections in the southern state will be declared on Tuesday. Among the issues discussed at the meeting, the party’s bid to reach out to Dalits was high on the agenda. According to party sources, Shah asked all the office bearers to ensure all out efforts to reach out to Dalits and marginalised sections of the society. Often accused of being an anti-Dalit party particularly after the Supreme Court’s recent verdict diluting the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the BJP has trying to shed the tag. Besides eating food at Dalit homes, BJP leaders have been spending nights at SC/ST dominated villages in the country. Following the apex court verdict, Prime Minister   had exhorted all party MPs to spend at least two nights in villages over 50 per cent population of Dalits. However, in the wake several controversies surrounding BJP leaders taking food at Dalit homes, the leadership cautioned against continuing with the initiative. “Shah asked all of us to make more efforts to reach out to the Dalits especially the PM’s programme of spending night at Dalit dominated villages. Over 20,000 such villages have been identified and our MPs have spent night in many such villages. “However, it has been suggested that we should refrain from doing anything which might create a controversy. There has been lot of needless controversies surrounding eating at Dalit homes,” said a party functionary. Recently Union Minister Uma Bharti  a meal with Dalits saying she was not Lord Rama who would purify people by having food with them. Karnataka BJP president BS Yeddyurappa faced a  for “practising untouchability” after he chose to eat food bought from a nearby hotel while visiting the house of a Dalit.   BJP minister from Uttar Pradesh Suresh Rana also courted a similar   when he allegedly ordered food from outside instead of eating at the house of a Dalit man he visited.   BJP leaders’ tryst with food at Dalit homes had attracted stringent criticism from none other than RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat who   them “not to do drama” of taking food at the homes of Dalit families. Besides the Dalit outreach, the party leaders have also been instructed to work more at booth level and at the grassroots. They have also been asked to endorse the various schemes and good work of the Modi government through social media platforms. The meeting comes ahead of a convention of the national executives of all the 'morchas' or the wings of the party on May 17 with Modi scheduled to address it. “Today’s meet Shah shared his vision about the roadmap for the party to undertake in the next one year with special focus to the upcoming assembly elections and the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In the meeting with all the seven party morchas, the Prime Minister will share his vision. “Both Shah and Modi have been stressing on the need to connect at the grassroots and with the youth. The focus continues to be the same. The task is carry the message of down the last people of how the Modi government and the BJP is pro-poor, pro-farmers and pro-Dalit. The message we carry is BJP means inclusive growth,” said a party functionary. Informing about the minutes of the meeting, BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said that Shah harped on the roadmap of the party retaining power in 2019.  “There are still some people who believe our massive victory in 2014 was a fluke. That is why Shah said 2019 is the target. We not just know how to form a government and efficiently run it we also know how to retain power. Shah exhorted that we will come to power with a massive mandate in 2019,” said Hussain. With BJP electoral victories continuing Shah also warned against party growing complacent. “Because of our electoral victory one after the other, there is a sense of satisfaction among the party workers and leaders. But Shah warned that the satisfaction should not give way to complacency. He pointed to the demise of Congress which has suffered the fate because of its arrogance of power and undermining the organisational wellbeing of the party,” said another BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi. The party has also lined up a host of programmes to mark the completion of 4 years of the Modi government which falls later in the month.  ",2018-05-14,, BJP tells leaders to woo Dalits but without eating food at their homes | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bjp-tells-leaders-to-woo-dalits-but-without-eating-food-at-their-homes-113034.html
308,Sulagna Sengupta,"Violence marred the West Bengal Panchayat election on Monday as 13 people have died and several others have been injured in clashes between the ruling All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) and Opposition parties. Two out of the 13 people – one in Gopalpur in Coochbehar and the other at Tehatta in Nadia – died trying to prevent the AITC and the Opposition from entering into a clash. Meanwhile the Union Ministry of Home Affairs has instructed the West Bengal government to submit a report on the incidents of violence reported on the day of polls and action taken by the state police. The West Bengal Director General of Police has said that 12 people died on polling day, six of these due to political clashes and six due to other reasons. There have been allegations of booth capturing and intimidation of voters in Bhangor in South 24 Pargana, Egra in West Midnapore, Mohamadbazar in Birbhum and Dinhata in Coochbehar. Catch went to some of the polling booths at Bhangor in South 24 Pargana. We found that after 2 PM, no poll officials were seen inside the polling booth. For instance at Kanthalia Primary School in South 24 Pargana, voting started at 7 AM and was supposed to continue till 5 PM. But polling officials were not seen after 2 PM. Asil Sheikh, a AITC worker close to party MLA and Bhangor strongman Arabul Islam, said “The poll officials have gone for lunch and on behalf of them, we are guarding the polling booth”. When this reporter asked why all poll officials have gone for lunch at the same time, Sheikh replied sternly, “ I have already said they went for lunch. Please don’t ask any more questions.” Catch spoke to a few polling officials, who were too scared to come on the record. “We risked our lives and came here for polling duty. From 4 AM onwards, AITC goons gheraoed the polling stations. After 2 PM, they did not allow us to work independently and threatened us with a knife that if we still continue to work, we will be killed. We did not have any other option but to keep all the ballot boxes inside the polling station. We were given shelter at a nearby house. The police did not take any action when we asked for help”. On Friday, Arabul Islam was arrested by West Bengal police from his North Gazipur residence at Bhangor for allegedly murdering Hafizul Mollah an activist of the Jomi Jibika Bastutantra O Poribesh Raksha Committee. A senior official of state election commission said “We have received reports from various booths at Bhangor, Coochbehar, Birbhum and East Midnapore that the entire voting process could not be carried out till 5 pm and after 2 pm onwards, no poll officials were allowed to perform their duties. AITC workers threatened the poll officials to stop their work.” The scene at Kanthalia Primary School scene was almost replicated at most of the polling booths at Polerhaat area of Bhangor where Arabul Islam resides. At Polerhaat in Bhangor, Arabul’s people were pitted against the supporters of the Jomi Jibika Bastutantra O Poribesh Raksha Committee. At Anantapur Primary High School, a bomb was found near the polling booth when voters went to cast their vote. The members of the Committee also gheraoed the police at Anantapore More in Bhangor and demanded action against the AITC workers who did not allow voters to cast their vote. Mirja Hasan, general secretary of the Committee said “Trinamool workers did not allow people to cast their vote. At Bhangor in South 24 Parganas, there are eight Zilla Parishad and one Panchayat Samiti. In seven ZPs, Trinamool workers did not allow people vote freely. Police did not take any complaint related to poll malpractices”. According to the reports received from the state election commission, at Nakshipara in Nadia one Trinamool worker was killed due to an intra-party feud when he went to cast his vote. In Coochbehar state minister Rabindranath Ghosh was seen booth capturing and slapping an Opposition polling agent. A CPI(M) worker Debu Das and his wife were allegedly burnt to death by Trinamool workers after being locked inside their house at Kaccharibari area in North 24 Parganas in the wee hours of Monday. At Nandigram in East Midnapore, two CPI(M) workers have been shot dead allegedly by Trinamool workers when they went to cast their vote. A Trinamool worker was allegedly shot dead allegedly by SUCI workers in South 24 Parganas' Kultali. A CPI(M) worker was also killed in North 24 Parganas' Amdanga allegedly in clash with Trinamool workers at a polling booth. In Beldanga in Murshidabad, a BJP worker was allegedly killed by Trinamool workers. At Naoda in Murshidabad an independent candidate was allegedly killed by a Trinamool worker when he went to cast his vote.  general secretary of CPI(M) leader said “ Our state leaders have gheraoed the state election commission office on Monday evening as Commission did not accept any complaint. Democracy is at peril. No condemnation is strong enough to denounce the barbarity which West Bengal witnessed on Monday to ensure AITC‘s project of capturing cent percent of elected Panchayat bodies in the state. In most cases, poll observers are not responding to any complaints”. Partha Chatterjee, state parliamentary affairs minister, said “Minor isolated incidents have been reported. The Administration and state election commission has taken steps where clashes took place. Voting was conducted peacefully and I strongly condemn the attack on journalists.”",2018-05-14,," West Bengal Panchayat polls: On the ground in Bhangor, where AITC controls polling booths | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/west-bengal-panchayat-polls-on-the-ground-in-bhangor-where-aitc-controls-polling-booths-113043.html
309,Anurag Dey,"“Congratulations to the winners of the Karnataka elections. For those who lost, fight back. If Congress had gone into an alliance with the JD(S), the result would have been different. Very different,” she said on Twitter.Prime Minister   has yet again woven his magic enabling BJP emerge as the single-largest party in Karnataka. This brought him closer to his aim of reducing the Congress to ""Punjab, Puducherry, Parivar Congress” or “PPP Congress”, a jibe which he had made against the grand old party during the high decibel campaign. The saffron party left the ruling Congress far behind but was still below the majority mark in the 224 seat Assembly. As per the latest trends, the   (BJP)'s has either won or is leading in 104 seats, the Congress is at 78 and the   (Secular) at 37. However, in terms of vote share, the Congress was marginally ahead with 37.9% votes and the BJP at 36.2%. The JD(S) continued to be distant third with 18.5%. Polling was not held in two Assembly constituencies. In Rajarajeshwarinagar election has been postponed to 28 May due to seizure of fake voter ID cards while polling was countermanded in Jayanagar constituency due to the death of the BJP candidate. Only time will tell whether the Congress is able to avenge the embarrassment in Goa, Manipur and Meghalaya, where the BJP managed to form the government even thought the Congress was the single-largest party. However, Karnataka has remained consistent with his long-standing habit of not providing successive terms to any government. No party in Karnataka has won a second successive term in office since 1985 when the Janata Dal under Ramakrishna Hegde had retained power. If Karnataka too falls in its kitty, the BJP will be in charge of 21 states in the country and the Congress will be restricted to just Punjab, Mizoram and Puducherry. With its poll campaign initially failing to take off, the BJP was heavily reliant on Modi to turn the tide and he did it in style. Increasing the number of rallies to 21 from the original 15, Modi crisscrossed the state addressing rallies one after the other. Focusing his narrative on Congress-bashing and the Dalit push, Modi ensured his connect with masses remained not just intact but also translated into votes. Often accused of being “anti-Dalit” the BJP’s major cause of concern was the massive nationwide Dalit outrage over the Supreme Court’s verdict that diluted the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Modi governments delayed reaction in filing a review petition. Keeping that in mind, Modi in his rallies harped on the party’s commitment towards the cause of the Dalits and BR Ambedkar. Trying to kill two birds with one stone, Modi relentlessly attacked the Congress for its apathy towards the greatest Dalit icon Ambedkar. He also lavished praises on his government for various pro-Dalit and pro-poor schemes and for strengthening the SC/ST Act by introducing new offences by amending the law in 2016. He also talked about how the BJP enabled   a Dalit to get elected as the President and alleged that   did not even paid him a courtesy visit. Modi’s Dalit assertions seemed to have paid off as the BJP made big gains in the SC/ST reserved seats. While Modi’s increase in the number of rallies was perceived by many as a sign of BJP’s nervousness, but the party asserted the Prime Minister was their trump card and his campaign blitzkrieg like in other states particularly Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat will yet again lead to a stellar performance. From connecting with the masses in the native language to paying reverence to local icons and asserting the commitment towards honoring local aspirations, Modi through his rallies made all the right noises. Through the BJP's performance, PM Modi has also been able to prove that his popularity extends to the South as well. The BJP's gains also indicate that the Lingayats have remained with the party despite Chief Minister Siddaramaiah announcing minority status to them as members of a separate religion. As regards its performance, the BJP did well both in urban and rural areas including the traditional Congress stronghold Hyderabad Karnataka where of the 40 seats, it was leading in 14 seats as per latest trends. It was far ahead in Mumbai Karnataka leading in 30 of the 50 seats and swept coastal Karnataka with 18 of the 21 seats. In Old Mysuru with around 60 seats, the BJP was ahead in 10 seats. Among the major winners for the BJP are its prospective Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa who won from Shikaripura for the seventh time. He defeated Congress’ G Malatesha by over 35,000 votes. A former deputy chief minister, BJP’s R Ashoka won from Padmanabanagar constituency. BJP’s G Somashekhara Reddy, brother of scam tainted mining baron G Janardhana Reddy, was leading from Bellary City. A former state minister, Somashekhara Reddy was charge-sheeted in 2012 by Andhra Pradesh's Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in the cash-for-bail case involving his brother. However, B Sreeramulu,a confidant of the Reddy brothers, was trailing to Chief Minister and Congress candidate Siddaramaiah from Badami. Meanwhile joining the bustle for government formation, the BJP central eldership deputed union ministers Prakash Javdekar, J P Nadda and Dharmendra Pradhan to Bengaluru. The party also reportedly cancelled its Parliamentary board meeting that was scheduled later in the day. Yeddyurappa who was slated to come down to the national capital to discuss about government formation has been asked to stay back. Hailing BJP’s victory, Yeddyurappa accused the Congress of “trying to subvert the mandate through dubious means”. “This is a verdict for BJP. People have completely rejected the Congress. The fact that Siddaramaiah himself has been voted out in his own constituency shows the anger of people towards the Congress. “Congress has been flatly rejected by people of Karnataka who have voted for change. However Congress is trying to subvert the mandate through dubious means. People of Karnataka won't allow for this to happen. Will consult with central leaders on the next course of action,” he said.  The BJP's performance has been hailed by BJP leaders and ministers. “People have yet again reiterated that BJP is the only pan-India party and accepted across the length and breadth of the country. Modi is the name which binds this heterogeneous nation into a single chord while   is the person who has introduced a new political culture where all those in public life have devoted themselves 24X7 into the service of the nation. This is the emergence of true grassroots democracy,” said union minister Jitendra Singh",2018-05-15,, Karnataka election result: BJP falls short despite Modi magic | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/karnataka-election-result-bjp-falls-short-despite-modi-magic-113202.html
310,Aditya Menon,"Compared to the 2013 Assembly elections, the JD(S)' vote share came down marginally, from 20.2% to 18.4%. However, this is not an accurate indication of how well the party has done in these elections. It's biggest success was in Chamundeshwari, where its candidate GT Deve Gowda defeated Chief Minister Siddaramaiah with a sizable margin of over 36000 votes. The party's real success can be gauged in comparison with the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. It got a measly 11.1% of the total votes cast, getting squeezed between the two big national parties. It led in just 15 Assembly segments, less than half of its current tally. Much of the JD(S)' gains in its stronghold of Old Mysore are at the expense of the Congress. Among the seats where the JD(S) attained a lead compared to 2013, 17 were held by the Congress and 8 by the BJP. In the Old Mysore region, JD(S) won 20 seats out of 43, with a vote share of nearly 35%, above both Congress and BJP. However, the surprises were the JD(S) wins outside its core region. Particularly significant are its victories in seats such as Bidar South in Bidar district, Gurmitkal in Yadgir district, Manvi and Sindhanur in Raichur district and Nagthan and Sindgi in Bijapur district. In these seats, the JD(S) vote share was less than 10% in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The rise in the party's vote share in all these seats is in excess of 25%. In many of these seats, the party has benefitted due to its alliance with the   and  's All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen. The alliances with these two parties helped JD(S) wean away a chunk of the Congress' Dalit and Muslim votebank. To attract the support of these sections, Muslims in particular, JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda had explicitly stated that he would disown his son Kumaraswamy if he seeks the support of the BJP. The support from minorities made it all the more difficult for the JD(S) to throw its lot behind the BJP following a hung Assembly. However, in the Old Mysore region, the JD(S) may also have benefitted from some tactical voting by some BJP supporters who didn't want the anti-Congress votes to split in seats where the BJP didn't have a chance.    Through clever alliances and a conscious strategy to focus on only winnable and marginal seats, Kumaraswamy managed to achieve a robust tally of 38 for the JD(S) and its allies. The victory was made even sweeter with the Congress, including Kumaraswamy's arch-rival Siddaramaiah, bowing before the party and agreeing to play second fiddle just to keep the BJP out. The ideological basis of the prospective post-poll alliance was underlined by Karnataka Congress chief G Parameshwar, who made it a point to stress that the ""S"" in JD(S) stands for ""secular"". This was an about turn from Congress President  's comment during the campaign that the letter stood for ""Sangh"". Now Kumaraswamy's main task is to keep his flock together and hope that the Congress is able to prevent defections in its ranks. The kingmaker may soon get to become king for the second time.When   (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy claimed during the election campaign in Karnataka that his party would emerge as the ""king, not the kingmaker"", almost everyone dismissed it as hyperbole. He may well have the last laugh as he stands at the cusp of becoming the Chief Minister of Karnataka for the second time. This despite the fact that the JD(S) won 37 seats, three less than its 2013 tally of 40. It's ally, the Bahujan Samaj Party, has won one seat: Kollegal in Chamarajnagar district. Early trends on Tuesday suggested that the   was heading for a comfortable majority in the Karnataka Assembly. However, a late surge in favour of the Congress restricted the BJP to 104 seats, 8 short of the majority mark. Realising the need to prevent the BJP from wresting its 21st state, the Congress was quick to reach out to the JD(S) and announce the unconditional support of its 78 MLAs to Kumaraswamy as the next CM. Congress leader DK Shivakumar, who is said to be the ""money-bags"" of the party, also swung into action and secured the support of Independent MLA H Nagesh, who won from the Mulbagal seat in Kolar district with the support of the Congress, and Ranibennur MLA R Shankar of the Karnataka Pragnyavantha Janatha Party. With these 80 MLAs on his side in addition to his own, Kumaraswamy is said to have the support of 118 MLAs in the 224 member Assembly. The effective strength of the Assembly is 222 as elections weren't held in two seats. However, as Kumaraswamy has won from two seats - the adjoining constituencies of Ramanagaram and Channapatna in Ramanagara district - he will have to resign from one, taking the alliance's tally down to 117 and that of the House to 221. If the BJP fails to engineer any defections in the ranks of the Congress and JD(S), Kumaraswamy will be able to prove his majority in the House when given a chance by the Governor.",2018-05-15,, Karnataka verdict: 'Kingmaker' to king?

By afternoon, it seemed to be stuck an arm's length, away from the required number. Soon, Azad and Gehlot appeared in state capital Bengaluru even as counting was on, seemingly to hold parleys. Those familiar with Kumaraswamy's mood were not confident though. As a senior city-based journalist explained, “he would not be ready to be a deputy of any other chief minister.” In effect, he would want the hot seat for himself. Will Congress, with double the number of seats, be ready to play along? The same Congress, which couldn't make itself party to a Samajwadi-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh just a few months ago, to take on the BJP in bye-polls. Camp BJP did not think it would.

Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda's party was quick to accept the offer. Early evening, the Congress leaders went to the Raj Bhavan to stake their claim, but the BJP was in no mood to give up. At its parliamentary party meet in New Delhi, party chief   presented the results as a BJP victory. Spokespersons of the party were busy telling news anchors that the governor must invite the single-largest party to form the government. Precedents, however, differ: In the past presidents and state governors have made all sorts of invitations in cases of fractured mandates: While former CM BS Yeddyurappa was quick to stake a claim on behalf of the BJP, the Congress cited the examples of Goa and Manipur, where the respective governors had invited the BJP to form the government despite it trailing the Congress in seat-count. Whatever Vala's decision be, none of the sides would find it easy. For the BJP, the seven-seat shortfall looks unbreachable. Even if it manages to woo the BSP, KPJP and independent members, it would need the support of four more. That would keep the Congress and JD(S) on tenterhooks until the floor test on fears of their MLAs being poached – the drama over Ahmed Patel's re-election is fresh in memory. If nothing works, another election would be the only way out. Prime Minister   and Shah have been quick to congratulate the party and claim victory. The Congress meanwhile, was busy trying to prevent its bete noire from assuming power. But the reality is that the mandate is fractured – an image distorted. On the face of it, the BJP made handsome gains – 104 seats, up from a meagre 40 in the last Assembly polls in 2013. Even if you add the six and four seats, won respectively by breakaway factions Karnataka Janata Paksha (led by Yeddyurappa) and B Sreeramalu's BSRCP, the achievement remains tall. Congress, on the other hand, lost vast ground: Falling to 78 from 122. The JD(S) lost a minor two seats while ally BSP bagged one. This clear distinction between the levels of the big parties start fuzzying when you look at the voteshare: While 36.2% of those who voted chose the BJP, the Congress was ahead with 38% votes, which is actually more than the 36.6% it notched last time. Back then, the BJP garnered only 19.9% but adding the breakaways its tally was 32.4% – still, it is a gain. JD(S) fell a notch to 18.4% from 20.2%. That doesn't take ally BSP into account though. The voteshare doesn't reflect proportionally in seats because the Congress votes were spread through the state but not so for others. The JD(S) returned strong numbers in the Old Mysore region (25 of 51 seats) and some other pockets in the east and north, effectively converting its votes into seats. The BJP did that in a much more productive way in the rest of the state and the urban centres. In fact, it won seats in all six geographical areas of the state. In the polarised coastal belt, its dominance was near perfect: 18 of 21. Congress managed seats across the state too but it was evidently spread too thin. This picture of Congress's decimation – the first time after   took over the reins – can be misleading though, once you compare the situation with the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Amit Shah may be putting up a happy face but the fact remains that the master strategist fell short of target – the Mission 150 – again after Gujarat. That 150 was a long shot was clear when last Thursday – the last day of campaigning – he said the party would win “at least 130 seats”. Tuesday's results are way behind even 130. So what happened? The logic of Shah's target gets clearer when you consider that in the 2014 General elections the BJP led in 130 Assembly constituencies while winning 17 of the state's 28 Lok Sabha seats. For someone as ambitious as Shah, a target of 150 is but only a logical progression. It, of course, proved tougher on the ground as a resolute Siddaramaiah threw in a stiff fight, matching the BJP in ingenuity with issues such as a separate religion tag for Lingayats and appealing to the Kannada sub-nationalistic sentiment. The advent of Modi, whose brand equity remains steller in the state, of course gave a much-needed fillip to the BJP in the neck-and-neck race. Journalists and political pundits vouched that Modi was a factor, just like he was in 2014. Thus Shah couldn't be blamed for hoping to at least retain those levels. But Tuesday's results show that was not the case – the BJP slid considerably from its 2014 levels. It has lost ground in the eastern region around capital Bengaluru, even coming third in some seats of Kolar that it won four years ago. The Congress clawed back and wrested 16 of the region's 36 seats while JD(S) took seven, leaving the BJP with 11. In the Hyderabad-Karnataka region, the Congress snatched 15 of 31 seats while the BJP managed 12, leaving four for the JD(S). Even a Modi campaign couldn't win Bellary for the BJP. The same was the case in Chamarajanagar in the south; in Jamkhandi and Koppal; one seat each in Belagavi and Gulbarga and several in Bengaluru. Apart from the coastal belt, the BJP remained strong in the Mumbai-Karnataka region with 30 seats (Cong – 17) and central Karnataka (BJP - 24, Cong – 11). In the 2014 polls, the BJP garnered an overall 43% in the state. The Congress did 40.8%, both declines. Like Modi, a large part of Rahul Gandhi's campaign can also be seen as a misfire. For the Congress, however, it was Siddaramaiah who was leading the battle. Going by 2014 standards, he managed to save most of the party's ground. But it doesn't seem that his banking on the AHINDA base – a coagulation of Kurubas (his own community), the scheduled castes and tribes, other backwards classes and religious minorities – paid off as he expected. To complete the picture you need the JD(S), who penned the story of a spectacular comeback from being reduced to two Lok Sabha seats, with leads in only 15 Assembly segments and a 11% voteshare. Its 18% voteshare this time means it has not only succeeded in holding on to its Vokkaliga base but has also added other communities. The pre-poll understanding with the BSP and the little leg-up from All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief   must have worked. On the whole, whatever Vala may decide and whoever may form the government, if the alliance whose foundation was laid on Tuesday continues it can set precedents and lead to interesting possibilities in the future. Politics, after all, is the art of that.The ball is now in Governor Vajubhai Vala's court: Will he invite the   (BJP), the single-largest, to prove its majority on the floor of Vidhana Soudha or will he pay heed to the combined claim of   and   (Secular)? On Tuesday evening he was still awaiting the final official tally from the Election Commission of India. By then, the picture was clear, though as the fate of all but a handful of the seats were declared. Among the 222 constituencies where elections were held, the BJP won 104 and Congress 78. JD(S) bagged 37 while its ally Bahujan Samaj Party ( ) added one to the kitty. The Karnataka Pragnyavantha Janatha Party (KPJP) and an independent candidate also managed a seat each. Polling was not held in two seats. Considering JD(S) and former CM HD Kumaraswamy won from two constituencies (Channapatna and neighbouring Ramanagaram), the requirement for forming of the government will be the support from 111 members of the Legislative Assembly (excluding the sole nominated member). Ever since counting started on Tuesday morning, BJP took the pole position and maintained its lead through the day. The general consensus among election watchers seemed to be that the saffron party would comfortably sail past the halfway mark. The morale of the bhakts were also boosted by several exit polls splashed across news television channels. Outgoing CM Siddaramaiah had also started sounding a little low after leading a vociferous Congress campaign, defending his record in office. Officially though, the Grand Old Party maintained all was well until Siddaramaiah started talking of a Dalit CM, a day before. The veteran Mallikarjun Kharge, however, introduced a twist in the tale on Tuesday morning: that he would discuss the possibility of an alliance the JD(S) with senior colleagues Gulam Nabi Azad and Ashok Gehlot.",2018-05-16,," BJP places first in Karnataka but Congress, JD (S) pull a fast one | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bjp-first-past-the-post-in-karnataka-but-congress-jd-s-pull-a-fast-one-113210.html
312,Charu Kartikeya,"The mandate can also be looked upon as a referendum on the performance of the government he led for the past five years. However, the failure to win elections is more often a failure of strategy, than the actual performance. In any case, the state has never allowed any CM to come back to power for a second consecutive term, since 1985. What is amply clear is that none of the tricks devised by Siddaramaiah, from raising Kannada sub-nationalism through the demand for a state flag to appeasing the numerically-strong Lingayats by recommending minority status for them, worked. In terms of strategy, the Congress party also appears to have made a huge mistake by not going for a pre-poll alliance with key players like JD(S) and  . Both parties have unambiguously accused the grand old party of arrogance and disrespect for regional parties. Failure to stitch alliances also reflects an inaccurate estimation of the party's own strength. Had Siddaramaiah assessed that his party will not be able to make it on its own, he would have leaned towards an alliance from the outset. It is also the Central leadership's fault to not foresee this. The party has already been found wanting on the alliance front in Uttar Pradesh, with the   and Bahujan Samaj Party joining hands but the Congress party staying away. In Karnataka, the process for government-formation is likely to go down to the wire now. The matter might even get dragged to the courts and there is no saying what the outcome will be. However, it will serve the Congress well to look at the shortcomings of its electoral strategy, with an eye on subsequent polls, including the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.If not for the last-minute coup pulled off by the Congress' old war-horses, the Karnataka Assembly election results would have come as a huge setback for the Congress party. On its own, the party won just under 80 seats and was clearly about to lose the only big state it was holding on to. With the Lok Sabha elections less than a year away, this would have been considered a highly bad portent. Thanks to the willingness of JD(S) leaders to work with them, the Congress party has been saved the ignominy of a rude push out of power. However, the tie-up with JD(S) is only a conciliatory arrangement and Congress must not harbour any illusions about its performance at the hustings. Its seats have nose-dived to a paltry 78 from the 122 it won in 2013. Its total vote share has more or less remained where it was (38.0% as compared to 36.6% in 2013), while the BJP's vote share has nearly doubled (36.2% from 19.9% in 2013). Initial analysis reflected a slide in the party's popularity among all kinds of voter groups, from Lingayats to Vokkaliggas to Muslims to SC/STs. One such analysis, done by NDTV, says Congress lost 19 seats in the Lingayat-dominated north central belt, 9 in the SC-ST dominated eastern belt, 7 in the coastal belt, 6 in the Vokkaliga-dominated southern belt and 2 among Muslim dominated seats. The analysis shows BJP gaining 26, 17, 12, 3 and 7, respectively, in all these areas. The Congress party's failure to win over the state's electorate appears complete, with blame on the shoulders of the state as well as central leadership. Siddaramaiah, now forced to vacate the chief minister's chair, has himself been defeated on one - Chamundeshwari - of the two seats he contested. The only solace for him is the victory of his son from his previous seat, Varuna. Similar to the faith reposed in Amarinder Singh for the Punjab polls, Congress high command had given Siddaramaiah full charge in Karnataka, from ticket allotment to leading the campaign. However, unlike Singh, Siddaramaiah failed to deliver.",2018-05-15,, Karnataka jolts Congress to open its eyes & smell the coffee | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/karnataka-jolts-congress-to-open-its-eyes-smell-the-coffee-113207.html
313,Atul Chandra,"Sunil Singh, the former president of Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) who was expelled from the outfit for fielding candidates for the 2017 Assembly elections in defiance of  ’s directives, announced floating of a parallel outfit in Lucknow. Singh was one of the founder members of HYV. Coming close on the heels of the  ’s shocking defeat in Gorakhpur, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s constituency, the development may not be good news for the mahant of the Gorakhnath mutt.  Sunil Singh was elected national president of Hindu Yuva Vahini - Bharat (HYV-B) at a meeting of its national executive in Lucknow Sunday evening. As chief patron of HYV, Yogi Adityanath appointed Singh its president in 2002. The social and cultural outfit earned notoriety for using strong-arm tactics to propagate Hindutva, protect cows, tackle love jihad and enforce ghar wapsi. He is a firm believer in aggressive Hindutva. While Singh’s move would seem to be a challenge to Adityanath’s authority in Gorakhpur and other parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, he himself clarified that his organisation will only carry forward the Yogi’s agenda of Hindutva, which was his life’s mission with power being only a “commercial break”. Sunil Singh said he would work towards the creation of a 'Hindu Rashtra', which was also the dream of Mahant Avaidyanath, Adityanath’s guru. He added that the Hindu Yuva Vahini had moved away from Hindutva and its members were now more into land grabbing and contractual work from government.  The HYV-B will soon launch a membership drive and a movement for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, he said. HYV General Secretary PK Mall said Singh was playing into the hands of the   and that his organisation had nothing to do with either Singh or the HYV-B. In 2017, Sunil Singh had fielded candidates in about a dozen eastern UP seats threatening to dent the BJP’s poll prospects. An angry Adityanath expelled him. Singh described his sacking as illegal and unconstitutional. He then said that Adityanath “has left his mission” and was running after the BJP. There may be some truth in Sunil Singh’s charge that the HYV cadres were into land-grabbing and government’s contract as within two months of Yogi becoming the CM, the BJP raised the red flag over the “outsider” Vahini’s growing clout. The issue was first raised by Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who had not relinquished the post of party president until then. At the state executive meeting last May 2017 he said “outsiders” were getting preferential treatment in the government while the party cadre was being disregarded. This, he said, was unacceptable. Maurya dismissed HYV as a threat to the BJP. The increasing complaints against ochre scarf-wearing men harassing people in the name of Hindutva and cow vigilantism also prompted Adityanath to warn that he would expose imposters who were “misusing” saffron to malign his government. In April 2017, Adityanath reportedly held separate meetings with HYV and the RSS workers and urged Vahini members to maintain “decency”, not use saffron as the party’s colour, monitor government work and flag any discrepancies to their colleagues in HYV and not misbehave with any officer. The increase in violence in the name of love jihad and cow protection, forced the HYV to stop its membership drive for one year. The HYV’s general secretary PK Mall, a close associate of Adityanath, stated that his organization will not accept any new membership for the next six months. There was an “exponential” growth in HYV’s membership after Adityanath became CM, Mall claimed. As Sunil Singh has returned to haunt the BJP and Adityanath, so far neither has reacted to his announcement on either forming HYV-B or on carrying forward Yogi’s ‘mission’. It is possible that, as alleged by Mall, Singh has Samajwadi Party’s backing. Whether it will be politically advantageous for  , and to what extent, would be known only later.",2018-05-16,, Ex-protege may now be irritant for Adityanath | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/ex-protege-becomes-may-now-be-irritant-for-adityanath-113332.html
314,Rajeev Khanna,"His acquittal in a three decade-old road rage case from the Supreme Court is all set to broaden the area of influence of cricketer-turned-politician  , not only in Punjab politics but in the larger design of the Congress as well. With the shackles of a probable conviction that could have eclipsed his political growth gone, Sidhu now has the opportunity to carve out a niche and a path for his political growth within the grand old party. There are many in Punjab who feel that Sidhu, who is the current local bodies minister and finance minister Manpreet Badal are the most prominent names when it comes to assuming a successor of the state Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Just before the Punjab Assembly polls last year, it was being assumed that Sidhu might be given the designation of deputy chief minister but that was not to be. Offering the post to someone who had just joined the party a few days ahead of the polls would have led to a crisis within the party. This was followed by an era where the messages that came out were that every effort was made to confine him to a corner in the political set up. To begin with, he was given the portfolio of local bodies and culture which are seen as 'lightweight' ministries. More recently, he was cold-shouldered when it came to election of the Mayor in Amritsar after he Congress secured a comfortable win in the local bodies elections there. This was an insult to him as he has been representing Amritsar both as a MLA and Lok Sabha member. To add to this, he had no say in the local body polls in Patiala, Jalandhar and Amritsar that went to polls in December despite being the local bodies minister. But observers feel that now all this will change. “The baggage of the fear of conviction has gone. He will no be more aggressive in the days to come,” pointed a political observer.He is all set to emerge as a new pole in the Congress in Punjab. Sidhu has been the most vocal of the Congress leaders who has been seeking action against Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikramjit Singh Majithia on the issue of drugs and has been calling for steps to rope in the 'cable mafia' in the state that had prospered during the previous Akali-  (BJP) regime. On both these issues Amarinder has taken a 'cautious approach' that has not gone down well both among the Congress cadres as well as the masses. Over the last one year there were indications that his perceived closeness to Congress President   was also on the rocks on account of is not campaigning for the party candidates in both the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. These were two states where he had been listed as a star campaigner and his popularity as a cricketer and a good orator would have surely helped, particularly in the high profile Gujarat elections where Rahul had made extra efforts to ensure a much better performance than before. There is a point of view that this baggage of the road rage case had lots to do with Sidhu not taking on the saffron brigade in these two states. But this perception seems to be changing again if one looks at the speech Sidhu made at the Congress plenary session in Delhi in March, where he made full use of his oratory to convey that he is all committed to the party leadership. Now after his acquittal there are reports that Rahul, Amarinder and Priyanka were among the first to convey their congratulations to him. He too messaged Rahul, “I am now at the disposal of the party 24x7. My life is yours.” Sidhu is learnt to have met Rahul after a brief meeting with Amarinder on Tuesday afternoon. Sidhu's political journey started from the BJP and reached the Congress barely a few weeks ahead of the 2017 Punjab assembly polls. He was both a Lok Sabha and a Rajya Sabha member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He had decided not to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha poll after he was denied a party ticket to contest from Amritsar and was replaced by   as the party candidate. He declined the offer to contest from elsewhere. The party sent him to Rajya Sabha in 2016 to prevent him from joining the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) ahead of the polls. There were numerous speculations about Sidhu making a deal with AAP. He finally joined the Congress after launching a political front, Awaz-e-Punjab, along with prominent Hockey player Pargat Singh and the Bains brothers of Lok Insaf Party. It can now be expected that the Congress will make full use of him during the campaign in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh that go to the polls a few months down the line. The party needs good orators to counter the speeches made by Prime Minister   at the fag end of poll campaign in various states that are known to turn the tables in favour of the BJP. In Punjab, he will now be going full throttle to have his way in matters of governance. In all his political profile is all set for a boost in the days to come.",2018-05-16,," After Supreme Court acquittal, Sidhu's politics may get more bite | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/after-supreme-court-acquittal-sidhu-s-politics-may-get-more-bite-113345.html
315,Sulagna Sengupta,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's troubles have increased with state government employees demanding a high-level inquiry into the death of a poll official Rajkumar Rao, whose body was found at a railway track in the wee hours on Wednesday. Rao was posted at a booth in Itahar at Raigunj in Uttar Dinajpur. The government employees said that the government should ensure the safety of all officials who are on poll duty. Rao worked as an English teacher at Rahatpur High Madrashah School at Karandighi at Raigunj. His body was found at a railway track at Itahar and villagers of that area claimed that he was murdered by the cadres of the ruling All India Trinamool Congress as he did not allow them to enter the polling booth. Manoj Chakraborty , convenor of Trinamool Congress Employees Federation, said “ We demand a high level inquiry into the death of a poll official in Itahar. We have sent a letter to the state election commission and to chief minister’s office demanding adequate security for poll officials”. Bijay Shankar Sinha, general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) backed State Co-ordination Committee, said “We have noticed that employees are afraid to work at the counting centres following the death of the poll official. The large-scale violence during the elections has created resentment among government officials who are demanding a CBI inquiry into the official's death. We have also written a letter to the State Election Commissioner demanding stern action against the accused”. After the violence on polling day, the West Bengal State Election Commission and the state police have come under criticism by civil society, who claim that democracy has been murdered in Bengal . Veteran poet Mandakranta Sen said “If there was so much development in the state, why does the ruling Trinamool Congress have to resort to large-scale violence? The lection has become a farce. Police has been remained inactive in a planned manner in various places on the day of polling.” Senior police officers of state police said that the poll officer whose body was found in the railway track did not die in a political clash, but in an accident and that the investigation is going on. A senior police officer said “Rao was knocked down by the Radhikapur Express at Raigunj on Monday night when he was returning to his home after his poll duty. The Railway police is also inquiring into the matter.” Sources in the state election commission said that the State Election Commissioner has instructed the SP to submit a detailed inquiry report into the death of the poll officer. According to the reports received from the state election commission, repolling was conducted peacefully in 572 booths in around 19 districts. The State Election Commission has also instructed all district magistrates and Superintendents of Police to deploy armed police officials at counting centers and not allow poll officers to carry mobile phones during counting of votes. The SEC has imposed a ban on victory rallies by political parties till counting is over. On Tuesday, Prime Minister   addressed BJP workers and raised concerns about the violence during the poll process in West Bengal. He said that ballot boxes have been found in ponds and said that the violence was an attack on democracy. Upset at the PM's criticism, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has supposedly refused to attend the convocation of Visva Bharati University on 25 May, where Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina will be present. This has so far been denied by the University, which says that it hasn't received the itinerary from the Chief Minister's Office. Meanwhile, Banerjee continued with her efforts at strengthening anti-BJP forces at the national level and called up   (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy to congratulate him on his party's performance in the Karnataka Assembly elections. She urged him to keep up the pressure on the BJP.

316,Anurag Dey,"Former Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah too attacked the governor:  Meanwhile the BJP asserted Yeddyurappa will be supported by more than 120 MLAs. “The Supreme Court has ordered to prove majority in the assembly tomorrow at 4 pm. BJP welcomes this. We are confident that tomorrow at 4 pm BJP legislators and those supporting it will prove majority,"" Karnataka BJP General Secretary Shobha Karandlaje said. Ashwani Kumar, law minister in the previous   Cabinet, said the court’s order would play a major role in ensuring that governors exercise discretion fairly: “The Court’s order is a vindication of democracy, vindication of the Constitution. I believe the court has vindicated itself as the ultimate arbiter of the Constitution. I believe the decision of the Governor to call Yeddyurappa to form the government was wholly unconstitutional and politically unethical. “The exercise of discretion under Article 164 (of the Constitution) is in nature of sovereign prerogative. But it is predicated on the assumption that the power of discretion will be fairly and honestly exercised.”The Supreme Court Friday ordered Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa to demonstrate before the state legislative assembly that he enjoys support of the majority of its members, curtailing the 15-day period provided to him by Governor Vajubhai Vala. The floor test will be taken at 4 pm Saturday and a pro-tem speaker will decide the evenutalities in accordance with law, a three-judge Bench said. It barred the newly elected government from taking any major policy decision until then. The apex court also ordered the state government and the Governor to not nominate any member from the Anglo-Indian community to the House and directed the state police chief to ensure security of all MLAs.  A suggestion that the floor test be conducted by secret ballot was rejected. The Bench of Justices AK Sikri, SA Bobde and Ashok Bhushan was listening to a petition by Karnataka Congress chief G Paremeshwara and   (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy against the decision of Governor Vajubhai Vala to invite the   to form government. “Let the House decide and the best course would be floor test,” the Bench said while clarifying that it will deal with the constitutionality of Vala's decision later. Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who argued for the represented the Congress-JD(S) MLAs, termed the orders historic. During the hearing, Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi representing Yeddyurappa, opposed the floor test on Saturday and pleaded for it be conducted on Monday. He also submitted letters sent by the CM to the Governor staking claim to form the government. Earlier in a pre-dawn hearing on Thursday on an urgent basis, the Bench had asked for the letters to the Governor, while refusing to stay Yeddyurappa's swearing-in. The rare hearing took place after Singhvi approached the top court with the petition seeking to stall the oath-taking ceremony scheduled hours laterm, at 9 AM Thursday.

317,Joyjeet Das,"The BJP had drawn considerable flak March last year after it scooped away Goa and Manipur despite the Congress being the SLP.  In Goa, Governor Mridula Sinha accepted the BJP's claim that it enjoyed majority support though it managed to win only 13 of the 40 Assembly seats, and invited it to form the government. The Congress, on the other hand, was at 17 – closer to the majority mark of 21.  The then Defence Minister   flew back to his native state to become CM with the support of the Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party, the Goa Forward Party, the Nationalist Congress Party and Independent members. Manipur followed the same pattern: The Congress was not invited despite having 28 members – three short of majority. And the BJP, with 21 MLAs, cobbled an alliance with the Naga People's Front, the National People's Party (NPP), the Lok Janshakti Party and a renegade Trinamool Congress MLA. Aspersions were cast that the BJP could pull these off thanks to faithful governors and rampant horse-trading. A few months later, last July, Bihar Chief Minister   put in his papers citing differences with ally Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). The BJP swooped right in with its 53 MLAs to back the 71 of his Janata Dal (United). Again, the SLP – in this case RJD with 80 MLAs – didn't get a chance. Earlier this year, the Congress again missed the bus in Meghalaya bus. In this case, however, it was tied with the NPP with 20 seats each in the 60-member House. But the later got support from the BJP and others to form the government. These inctances came back to haunt the BJP Thursday when the Congress and the RJD raised demanded that either the principle of Karnataka should now be levied in such states or the Congress-JD(S) alliance be given a chance to prove its majority there. Goa Pradesh Congress President Girish Chodankar sought time from the Governor to lay claim over the government there. He later tweeted that the party has got a Friday noon appointment with her. Manipur Congress leader and former CM Okram Ibobi Singh said he too would meet Governor Najma Heptulla for Friday.  Bihar Opposition Leader and former deputy CM   also talked about meeting Governor SP Malik. He also called for Opposition leaders from across the country to go and campaign in Karnataka capital Bengaluru. The Congress and the RJD did not stand alone. Bahujan Samaj Party supremo came down heavily on the BJP:  West Bengal CM and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee threw in her support: Dravida Munnetra Khazagam leader MK Stalin also joined in: Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary   had already criticised the Karnataka move Wednesday. As did National Conference leader and former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah: On the other hand, the few major allies that the BJP are left with – the People's Democratic Party, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Lok Janshakti Party – did not come out in any major way to back the saffron party. Realistically perhaps the Congress and the RJD do not stand much of a chance even if they get appointments with the state governors: An elected governmet can only be brought down on the floor of the House. But the grandstanding in the three states managed to generate a lot of political buzz which will only add to the BJP's pressure over the ongoing Karnataka imbroglio.The 'difference' of the 'party with a difference' now threatens to spoil its party. Ever since   and   took the reins of the  , it has been on a roll electorally. In several states even electoral failure couldn't stop it from assuming power. But its desperation for an encore, in Karnataka, has boomeranged. After Governor Vajubhai Vala appointed BS Yeddyurappa chief minister despite the BJP not having a majority in the legislative assembly, a large section of the political spectrum cried foul. So intense was the bitterness that demands were raised to follow the same principle and bring down BJP governments in Goa, Bihar and Manipur. After a night-long drama, when the Supreme Court did not stay the morning swearing-in, the anger was palpable in Opposition parties. If the BJP could get a chance for being the single-largest party (SLP) in Karnataka, the Congress should also get the same chance in Goa and Manipur, the Grand Old Party claimed. Tejaswi Yadav demanded the same for Rashtriya   in Bihar.  Their claims found considerable support from other parties. On the other hand, not even its allies came out vocally in support of the BJP.",2018-05-17,," Karnataka resonates in Goa, Bihar, Manipur.

318,Rajeev Khanna,"Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala's move invitation to   (BJP) leader BS Yeddyurappa for being the chief minister and the grant of 15 days to prove that he has the support of the majority of members of the legislative assembly has raised several eyebrows. But it was expected. Vala, after all, has a   (RSS) lineage. He has been known for toeing the line of the party's central leadership, ignoring individual or groups. “  (this was bound to happen),” is what you hear when you bring the topic up with any politically aware Gujarati back home. People who have known him from say Vala has been loyal only to his party and not to his caste or community. “This can be ascertained from the fact that the Rajkot II seat, which later became Rajkot (West) that he represented right from 1985 onwards until 2012 hardly has any Karadia Rajput strength, the community to which he belongs. He has just been loyal to the BJP leadership. “At one point of time he was the finance minister in the Cabinet led by former CM Keshubhai Patel and then he acquired the same place in the Cabinet led by   in his avatar of the Gujarat chief minister. The transition in the top leadership never affected him,” pointed out a veteran political analyst based in Rajkot who has seen Vala's journey from a bicycle to a limousine. Vala was a seven-time MLA who held the record for presenting eighteen budgets in the Gujarat assembly before he went to become the speaker in Gujarat Assembly and the governor of Karnataka. Before becoming a MLA, Vala had been a corporator and also the mayor of the town and old timers still recall him as the 'Paaniwala Mayor' because the drinking water crisis in Rajkot had eased a bit during his tenure because of the supply coming from Bhadar Dam. Having joined the RSS during his school days, Vajubhai was among the top leaders of the BJP in Saurashtra at the time of its inception along with Keshubhai Patel and Chiman Shukla. “Vala still leaves no opportunity to come to Rajkot and attend social programmes. He has no qualms in saying that he has been rewarded well by his party for the services rendered by him. He is a qualified lawyer who never practiced,” said the observer. This is pretty evident as he was duly rewarded for having vacated his seat in 2001 when Modi was looking for a constituency after his anointment as the chief minister. Modi wanted to contest from Ellisbridge constituency in Ahmedabad but former home minister Haren Pandya denied to vacate the seat for him. It was Vala who vacated the Rajkot (West) seat for him. This seat is known to be the safest BJP seat in Gujarat. From the next election in 2002 that was held in the aftermath of Godhra train-burning incident and the subsequent anti-Muslim pogrom Modi went on to contest successfully thrice from Maninagar seat before he chose to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.  But he made it sure that Pandya was denied a ticket from Ellisbridge in 2002. Vala went back to his home turf in 2002, won and came back as the finance minister. It was after the 2012 Gujarat Assembly polls that he was made the speaker and subsequently sent to Karnataka in 2014. There are many political observers in Gujarat who are convinced that Modi had seen the possibility of a scenario that has emerged in Karnataka and had taken the timely action of sending his 'yes man' as the state governor and Vala according to them definitely has not let his party down. There are others who point that once Vala was made the governor, it was the rival group led by the current Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani that has established itself in Vala's constituency of Rajkot (West). Rupani won the polls from this seat in the recent polls, As a BJP politician Vala is known as a leader who equated development in rising land prices. He is known to have a keen interest in the real estate sector. Sources say that the booming of shopping malls and multiplexes in Ahmedabad, Rajkot and Vadodara can be dedicated to him because of the easy clearances coming from his revenue ministry that he had along with finance. There are many people who vouch that while even being in Bangaluru, he still keeps a tab on the real estate sector developments in his home state. Vala is also known for his political one liners and 'crude jokes' that he loves cracking in his native Kathiawadi. He never allowed the assembly sessions in Gujarat to be dull even for a single day both as a minister and as the speaker as his one liners provided enough humour to keep everyone alert. Coming back to the present scenario in Karnataka, what is visible is a role reversal of sorts between Vala and   (Secular) leader HD Deve Gowda. It was 22 years ago, when Vala was the BJP president in Gujarat and the Union government led by Deve Gowda had dismissed his party’s ministry led by chief minister Suresh Mehta, following unprecedented violence in the Gujarat Assembly. Now it is Vala holding the strings in Deve Gowda's home turf of Karnataka as the latter's son Kumaraswamy stakes claim to form the government in an alliance with the Congress. The 'nataka' in Karnataka is definitely not ending soon and Vala will continue to play an important role in how things unfold in the days to come.",2018-05-17,, Vajubhai Vala inviting Yeddyurappa isn't a surprise.

319,Charu Kartikeya,"RJD also condemned the Governor's decision, with national spokesperson Manoj Jha saying he was “ashamed to see a governor acting under pressure/direction of Prime Minister   and BJP chief  ”.     Later in the day, RJD leader   declared that his party will hold a dharna in Patna on Friday, demanding the Governor of Bihar to follow his Karnataka counterpart's logic, dismiss the NDA government in the state and invite RJD to form the government. RJD is the single largest party in the Bihar Assembly.  MP (Rajya Sabha) Sanjay Singh also said that the same logic should be applied in Manipur, Meghalaya, Goa and Bihar and the state governments there should be dismissed.   The strongest ripples of these developments were felt in Goa, where the Congress announced that it will parade its MLAs in front of Governor Mridula Sinha to demand that the BJP government be dismissed and Congress be invited to form the government, being the single-largest party in the state assembly.   While all these reactions indicate a growing political movement in the anti-BJP camp across the country, Governor Vala's invitation to Yeddyurappa appears not entirely in sync with the Constitution. Catch spoke to noted constitutional expert PDT Achary, former Secretary General of the Lok Sabha, to understand how constitutionally sound was the decision. Achary said, unequivocally, that the Governor has not fulfilled his constitutional obligation. He explained that Article 164 of the Constitution ordains the Governor to appoint the CM, but also mentions that the Council of Ministers to be subsequently appointed by the Governor on the advice of the CM must be collectively responsible to the House. Achary said that in layman's terminology, this means that the Council of Ministers must have confidence of the House, or majority in the House. He asserted that it was a constitutional obligation on part of the Governor to invite that leader who enjoys a majority in the House, which Yeddyurappa lacks in Karnataka's case. The former SG also recalled that in 1998, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee had staked claim to form the government, heading an alliance of parties, President KR Narayanan ascertained the reality of Vajpayee's claim himself and then invited him to form the government.BS Yeddyurappa's swearing in as the Chief Minister of Karnataka has rendered the midnight drama in the Supreme Court pointless. However, Governor Vajubhai Vala's decision to invite the BJP leader to form the government has not found approval of many. Vala invited Yeddyurappa late last evening and gave him 15 days to prove majority on the floor of the state Assembly. What it effectively means is that BJP has been handed 15 days to make several Congress-JD(S) MLAs switch sides or at least abstain at the time of voting. With the charge of the state administration, BJP has also been given the power to make this happen. Against this background, the Governor's decision has invited opprobrium from multiple quarters. While   chief   called the entire episode “a conspiracy to destroy the Constitution”, CPI(M) General Secretary   said “this is what happens when RSS pracharaks occupy Constitutional positions”.",2018-05-17,, Karnataka Governor is drawing widespread flak for doing exactly what BJP would have wanted | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/karnataka-governor-is-drawing-widespread-flak-for-doing-exactly-what-bjp-would-have-wanted-113501.html
320,Rajeev Khanna,"Incensed at the attempts by Hindutva outfits to interfere in Sikh religious matters and distort the community's history, Sikh groups are now trying to align with other religious minorities as well as Dalits. “We stand with the Dalits, Muslims, Christians and other minorities of India and will not allow the designs of the Brahminical forces including the RSS to succeed”. This is the message being sent out by various Sikh outfits. Members of the United Sikh Movement (USM) that claims to represent various political and social groups that are outside the ambit of the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) disclosed that they are now in touch with various groups and organisations representing the Dalits and minorities that are facing an onslaught from the Brahminical forces across the country. “We want to raise the question - what is happening across India? They are out to finish off everything that makes them uncomfortable. Even the Hindus are now questioning their motives and are feeling insecure and threatened. One day they change the name of colleges and on another change the name of roads. What was the purpose of changing the name of Dyal Singh College to Vande Mataram Dyal Singh College in Delhi when it is well known that Vande Mataram has been converted into a sort of a war cry against the Muslims. Then they go on to create a controversy over a picture of Mohammad Ali Jinnah,” said Captain Chanan Singh at a USM briefing in Chandigarh on Friday . Along with him another USM leader Dr Bhagwan Singh told Catch, “We are in touch with people like  , Prakash Ambedkar and groups like All India Milli Council along with several other organisations. We plan to hold a seminar and a meeting shortly where we will be chalking out our future course of action.” “We are opposed to idolatry, we never fast, we never perform yagnas and havans. We have got nothing to do with Brahminism yet the Brahminical groups are trying to meddle into our affairs. They are bringing out books referring to our Gurus as robbers and thieves while saying that some of them committed suicides. They are being called 'Gau Bhakts'. Anyone opposing them is told to go to Pakistan. We warn them to mend their ways failing which they will be the ones being sent to Pakistan. We will be forced to take to the streets and come out with an Elan-e-Jang,” said Captain Chaman Singh. The blasphemous content in books printed by Shree Bharati Prakashan in Dr Hedgewar Bhawan Parisar in Nagpur has taken the Sikh world by storm. People even outside the political domain are also agitated over reports on such literature being brought out and circulated across the country. It is the uproar over these books that was first reported by Catch that has led to the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) demanding strict action against the publishers of these books. Media reports quote a statement released by SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal stating that the SGPC has taken up the matter with the union human resource development (HRD) minister   and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis expressing the displeasure of the Sikhs over the distortion of the Sikh history and facts relating to the Gurus in the books that are being circulated. Longowal has reportedly demanded immediate withdrawal of the controversial book while cautioning Hindutva groups to restrain from indulging in such activities. But several Sikhs believe that an apology would not do in this case. They want the state government under Captain Amarinder Singh to register criminal cases against the culprits and arrest them. A large number of Sikhs are of the view that the Hindutva organisations like the RSS have infiltrated into the Sikh institutions like the SGPC and the Akal Takht through the SAD that is an ally of the   (BJP). “It is a chain. The Badals (Parkash Singh and Sukhbir Singh) led SAD have become the servants of the BJP and the SGPC has become the servant of the SAD. Things have today come to a pass that no one cares about the directives coming from the Akal Takht Jathedar or the SGPC. There used to be a time when the directives of the Akal Takht Jathedar were sacrosanct. The SGPC itself stands accused of having published books that have shown the Gurus in poor light,” said Captain Chanan Singh. A large number of Sikhs have been questioning the RSS and other Brahminical groups of their contribution to the Indian freedom struggle in the context of their propagating their version of cultural nationalism. Given the increasing beligerence of Hindutva forces, the resistance from Sikh groups is only likely to rise. ",2018-05-18,, How Sikh groups are trying to align with Dalits & minorities against Hindutva | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/how-sikh-groups-are-trying-to-align-with-dalits-minorities-against-hindutva-113659.html
321,Sulagna Sengupta,"Predictably, the All India Trinamool Congress has swept the West Bengal rural local body polls, winning almost all the Zilla Parishads and getting a 90% majority in all the three tiers of the Panchayat system. BJP was a distant second, winning some seats and reaffirming its place as the main Opposition party in West Bengal. The CPI(M) and the Congress stood at third and fourth respectively. Out of total 31,802 Gram Panchayat seats Trinamool Congress won 20,103 seats, BJP won 5291 CPI(M) won 1522, Congress won 969 seats and Independent candidates won 1708. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday dedicated her party's astounding victory to the people of the state. She also took the opportunity to lash out at the BJP particularly Prime Minister  , accused the AITC of murdering democracy in the state. Banerjee said “Our party won a landslide victory. We got 19 out of 21 zilla parishads. We have won despite the canards spread against us by the BJP. She also accused the BJP of going against constitutional norms in forming the government in Karnataka. Meanwhile, there were reports of violence on counting day as well in various districts like Purulia, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri,North 24 Pargana, Malda, Murshidabad, Coochbehar and Jhargram. The State Election Commission had to stop counting in North 24 Pargana and Coochebhar after they received reports that local Trinamool workers barged into counting enters and tried to snatch the ballots and started stamping ballot papers with their own party symbols. There was violence in Nituria in Purulia, Nadia district's Majdia and Bhagwangola in Murshidabad. A senior official of the State Election Commission “We have received complaints in several booths that ballot papers have been allegedly snatched by the ruling party workers. We are investigating the matter.” According to political analysts, the results are no different from the last few elections in which the AITC swept but BJP emerged as the principal Opposition. Maidul Islam, Professor of Political Science at Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, said “ The main reason for BJP's stunted growth in West Bengal is that in Bengal, it remains structurally weak due to infighting within own ranks and inability to match up to AITC's organised ground network. The difference between BJP's rise in Bengal and elsewhere in India is that while in other parts of the country it can grow relatively unhindered, in Bengal it is facing organised and violent resistance from the ruling Trinamool Congress In Kerala too they are facing the same resistance from the Left” According to Islam, the violence during the electoral process is an extremely disturbing trend. Another analyst Amol Mukherjee said “The results of the Panchayat elections indicate that AITC is not only the ruling party in Bengal, it is also the most dominant political force. The BJP is clearly the chief Opposition party while the Left Front is a poor third, and Congress is non-existent in Bengal.” Partha Chatterjee state parliamentary affairs minister said “The election results clearly indicated that the Opposition parties failed to perform on the ground. They approached the Court but they failed to prove their strength on ground. People voted us for the development work carried out across the state.” Dilip Ghosh, state BJP president, said “ It is not a one-sided win for the ruling party, BJP is still a part of the race, and they have grabbed the second position despite large-scale booth capturing and other tactics to intimidate voters. Even many of our candidates have failed to file their nominations.”",2018-05-17,, Trinamool sweeps Bengal Panchayat polls.

322,Joyjeet Das,"It hit the roof. Not that it was not expected. The fight for the chief ministership of Karnataka took an ugly turn and the Supreme Court had to open its gates post-midnight. Eventually the apex court refused to stay the process of   (BJP) state chief BS Yeddyurappa's oath-taking as chief minister, scheduled for 9 AM Thursday morning. Significantly, during the course of the past-midnight hearing of Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi's petition, the defence put it before the court that no anti-defection law would be applicable onto any member of the legislative assembly (MLA) before they are sworn-in. This would potentially make things easier for Yeddyurappa to fill up the seven-seat gap between him and chief ministership. The Shikaripura strongman was invited to form the government on Wednesday night by Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala, an old confidant of Prime Minister  . After keeping the state on tenterhooks throughout the day and meeting both the BJP and the Congress-  (Secular) combine and issued the invite only aroun 9 PM, leaving only about 12 hours for the swearing-in. Contrary to this haste, he granted the CM-designate 15 days to prove that he enjoys support of the majority of MLAs. Expectedly, this made the Congress-JD(S) alliance see red. But instead of taking another punch on its face after Goa, Manipur and Meghalaya, the Grand Old Party this time decided to give it back. Petitioning the Supreme Court against Vala's decision, Singhvi pleaded that the case be heard in the intervening night itself and a stay be granted. The apex court decided to do just that and a three-judge Bench took the case up right away. The Bench constituted by Chief Justice Dipak Misra comprised Justices AK Sikri, A Bobde and Ashok Bhushan.  Singhvi argued that the court would not be approachable once a CM was sworn in. He pointed out the respective strengths of the bickering sides: 104 for the BJP and 116 for the Congress-JD(S) combine, according to media reports. Singhvi argued that giving 15 days to Yeddyrappa to prove that he enjoyed the confidence of the majority of members would encourage the ""constitutional sin of poaching"". The Bench pointed out that the BJP had the most number of members and the Congress-JD(S) alliance was a post-polls arrangement. The government was being represented by Additional Solicitor Journal Tushar Mehta. On the BJP's behalf former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi was present. Before entering the courtroom he told reporters that the court could not intervene in the matter. Whether or not the BJP had the numbers could be proven only on the floors of the House. Current Attorney General KK Venugopal also reportedly arrived at the court. In his arguement, Singhvi cited the example of Goa where the BJP was invited to, and it did, form the government despite the Congress being the single-largest party. Citing past examples, he argued there was no reason to deviate at the present. The court considered the point whether it should restrain the governor, something if it wishes to do would have to be done before Yeddyurappa takes his oath at 9 AM. When the court wondered whether there would be an administrative vaccum, Singhvi pointed out that a caretaker government was already in place. The Congress leader argued that the governor's special privileges were also open to judicial scrutiny. In the past, the only time that the apex court opened its gate for hearing past midnight was before the execution of the capital punishment of Yakub Memon in the Mumbai bombing case. After Singhvi concluded his argument, Rohatgi started his. He argued that the hearing of the petition in the wee hours was ""totally wrong"". Saying the case was was based on speculations, he maintained the line that the court did not have jurisdiction over the matter. The court interestingly raised the issue of swearing-in the members of the House before the CM, which the government opposed citing precedents. The defence presented before the court that any anti-defection law would not apply before members were sworn-in. This means that they would be free to support any candidate of their choice for chief ministership.  The Supreme Court said it was worried about the situation and asked why the governor gave Yeddyurappa 15 days to prove his majority. Though the Bench refused to stay the swearing-in, it also did not dismiss Singhvi's petition, saying it was ""subject of hearing later on"". It issued notices to respondents, including Yeddyurappa. Despite the court refusing to stay the proceedings, Singhvi kept arguing that the swearing-in be at least postponed to Thursday evening so that relevant documents could be examined.",2018-05-16,, Battle for Karnataka: Supreme Court refuses to stay Yeddyurappa's oath-taking | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/karnataka-ball-in-supreme-court-as-race-to-hot-seat-gets-dirty-113361.html
323,Anurag Dey,"The Loya case was also the centre to the unprecedented media conference by top SC judges Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurien Joseph. The four senior-most judges have accused the CJI of assigning importance cases that included the Loya case, “selectively to the Benches of their preference”. The verdict has led to a political slugfest. Welcoming the verdict, the BJP said it was a slap on the face of Congress President  , who were trying to politicise the judiciary. “Congress’ conspiracy lies exposed and its attempt to score political point has failed. The people who have been politicising the judiciary for their own motives, now stand exposed,” said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra. Meanwhile Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the verdict will raise more questions. “You (court) have spoken about lawyers and their personal problems that is not the issue. The issue is the lacunae in the enquiry (into Loya’s death), that has not been addressed,” said Congress leader Tehseen Poonawalla, one of the petitioners. In a series of tweets he also punched holes in the verdict.   Another Congress leader and former Union minister Salman Khurshid said: “Many, many people will be deeply disappointed. The SC view has to be accepted and respected but what was hoped that the SC would go deeper into the affairs, something which is extremely, extremely controversial”.  Veteran legal practitioner Majeed Memon, a Rajya Sabha member from Nationalist Congress Party, said: “Please examine the background in which this matter was heard and disposed off by this Bench. With the highest respect to it, if there was some kind of suspicion, some kind of disbelief in the minds of people that they will not get justice from a particular Bench, then the Bench ought to have recused. If he died a natural death and there is nothing suspicious about it, then what was the problem in having a probe? Whatever the political stands be, it looked unlikely that Thursday's verdict will put the matter to rest.The country may continue to debate about the mysterious death of BH Loya. But for the Supreme Court there was no mystery: the special CBI judge who was hearing the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case – in which   chief   was prime accused – died a natural death. A three-Judge Bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud, dismissed the petitions seeking an independent investigation into judge Loya’s death and warned the petitioners for abusing the process of public interest litigation (PIL) for political and financial motives. Pronouncing the eagerly awaited verdict, the bench held the petitions to be “absolutely meritless”. “PIL jurisdiction is being misused to settle political agenda. There is a great danger if this is allowed to continue. Political battles should be fought in the halls of democracy and not inside court,” said the Bench. It castigated the petitioners’ counsels for scandalising the judiciary and casting aspersions on the Administrative Committee of the Bombay High Court, but stopped short of initiating civil contempt against the petitioner. Among the counsels for the petitioners was Prashant Bhushan, who had been pivotal in a recent aborted attempt to bring impeachment motion against the CJI in Parliament.  After Thursday's verdict, Bhushan said: “It is a wrong decision, and in my view it’s a black day for Supreme Court. Despite the presence of so many doubts and suspicion, the SC instead of an independent probe put a lid on judge Loya’s death. This puts a bigger question mark about the basis on which this verdict was given and at whose insistence”. The petitions seeking a Special Investigation Team probe were filed following reports by t  magazine about Loya’s family members suspecting foul play behind his death and making shocking revelations, including a bribe offer of Rs 100 crore to a top Maharashtra judge in return for a favourable judgment in favour of Shah.  Loya died during the intervening night of 30 November and 1 December, 2014 while he was on a visit to Nagpur. Taking over the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case after his predecessor judge JT Utpat was suddenly transferred, Loya questioned Shah’s absence during the hearing of the sensational case.  Within a month of Loya’s death, Shah was discharged by the CBI court.  Curiously, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which had indicted Shah of being a “part of the larger conspiracy to kill Sohrabuddin, subsequently his wife Kauser Bi and and finally Tulsiram Prajapati, did not challenge Shah’s discharge. In the aftermath of   reports, the Maharashtra government ordered a “discreet enquiry” in the case. In it, the four judicial officers who accompanied Loya to the hospital after he complained of chest pain had denied any foul play in their statements. The CJI Bench, while dismissing the petitions, said there was no reason to “disbelieve the sequence of events leading to the death as narrated by the four judicial officers”.

324,Rajeev Khanna,"The most scathing reaction to the news of the alliance came from BJP state chief Subhash Barala, who called it a “mismatched marriage”, harking back to 1998. “While INLD patriarch Chaudhary Devi Lal was the rallying point for the Third Front, his successors have taken the party to the pits where it is looking up to the BSP leadership for survival,” he said. “In the last Assembly polls where the INLD candidates had come a close second on 17 seats and the margin of loss was less than five per cent of the votes. It is being perceived that with a little support, they could have won and the party tally would have gone up to 38 seats.  “In such circumstances there are often chances of the party forming the government. The coming together of INLD and BSP is a first major move ahead of the forthcoming polls and many more such moves will dot the poll matrix in the days to come,” says senior political observer Balwant Takshak. Observers say that if the combination gathers steam in the months to come it would pose a major challenge to the Congress that is eying major political gains. It need to be seen how the Dalits take to supporting the INLD that is widely perceived to be a Jat political force.  During the Jat agitation of 2016, the Dalits had been at the receiving end in places like Gohana. Many things will emerge in the days to come but for now the INLD has definitely put politicking in the first gear in Haryana.With more or less a year to go before the General election process kicks in, Haryana's political firmament is showing signs of heating up soon. Wednesday the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and Bahujan Samaj party ( ) drew first blood in the poll arena by annoincing an understanding. For starters, a tie-up will surely be a boost to main Opposition INLD, which is out of power for the third term now. But that won't be the be all and end all, political observers think. Dalits, BSP's core supporters, are around 21 per cent of Haryana's population. Although they have been traditionally Congress supporters, the BSP too has been able to put in place a dedicated base. By eying to garner most of the downtrodden community's support,  's party is now looking at emerging kingmaker.  Wednesday Haryana Leader of Opposition Abhay Singh Chautala (INLD) and BSP's Meghraj Singh announced the parties have joined hands in Haryana to keep the   (BJP) and the Congress out of power. Singh is in charge of BSP's affairs in Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand. The two parties had come together for a short-lived alliance in 1998. It remains to be seen how they avoid the repeat of that episode, when senior-most INLD leader Om Prakash Chautala was at the helm of affairs. Abhay, Om Prakash's son, said the alliance was on certain broad contours and Mayawati would be projected as the prime ministerial candidate.  The Congress is guilty of massive corruption and the BJP has left no stone unturned to lead the country towards violent inter-community and inter-communal conflicts and polarise the society. Therefore all forces representing the downtrodden, suppressed, farming and the labouring classes must join hands to oust and keep them away from power, he said. Abhay claimed the coming together has laid the foundation for a Third Front. The two parties are determined to champion the cause of the Dalits, farmers and the working class and create a new Haryana. Meghraj too reiterated the resolve of the two parties to give a credible alternative to the nation and keep the BJP and the Congress out of power in Haryana. The issue sharing of seats in elections has been left open for the moment. Both the leaders also resolved that the BSP will lend its wholehearted support to the 'Jail Bharo' agitation being launched by the INLD from May 1. Meanwhile Meghraj said BSP’s lone legislator in Haryana Tek Chand Sharma has been suspended since party workers were dissatisfied with his functioning and he extended outside support to the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government. In the last Assembly polls, the BSP cornered 4.37 per cent votes, a 2-percentage point fall than in 2009.  The INLD and the BSP formed an alliance ahead of the 1998 Lok Sabha polls and the BSP had even managed to win the Ambala seat. The INLD won its maximum of four out of the state's 10 seats. The alliance was short lived as Om Prakash announced support for the minority BJP government at the centre under Atal Behari Vajpayee. At that time the relation between the BJP and Mayawati had hit rock bottom. In 2009, the BSP had also gone in for an alliance with Haryana Janhit Congress, led by Kuldeep Bishnoi but it broke ahead of the polls.",2018-04-19,," INLD, BSP pre-poll pact puts politics in top gear in Haryana | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/inld-bsp-pre-poll-pact-puts-politics-in-top-gear-in-haryana-108809.html

326,Charu Kartikeya,"The process of rebellion that Yashwant Sinha triggered months ago met its natural conclusion Saturday. The former finance minister announced that he has severed all relations with BJP, the party that was his home for over two decades. “The future of democracy” is in danger, Sinha said while making the announcement, at an event in Patna. The event was the first gathering of a platform created by Sinha and a few other leaders about a year ago, named Rashtra Manch. Saying he was sad at the erosion of democratic institutions in the country, Sinha announced he wasn't just quitting the BJP but was giving up party politics forever. Vowing to never join any political party from now on, he also pledged to launch a massive movement to save democracy. Many will be compelled to say that this will hardly have any impact on the BJP's electoral prospects because Sinha appears to have become a spent force. He has not been fighting elections and has been sidelined inside his party for a long time. However, his action needs to be looked at from the prism of what it says about how BJP has changed from his glory days in the party to now. It must be remembered that Sinha is not from RSS ranks and was a case of lateral entry into BJP. He rose in stature in spite of that and was eventually appointed national vice-president, apart from Finance Minister and External Affairs Minister.  However, the rise of   and   proved to be disastrous for him and two other party veterans, LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi. Along with Jaswant Singh, these three leaders occupied top positions in the party and the government when the BJP first came to power under former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In the year when Modi became PM, Vajpayee, Advani and Joshi were dropped from the party's parliamentary board and relegated to a newly constituted body called 'Margdarshak Mandal', essentially a toothless old age home of sorts. Sinha didn't find a place even there. Non-allegiance to RSS is what distinguishes him from Advani and Joshi and it is this difference that explains the difference in their approaches. Advani and Joshi have quietly receded into the background, largely surrendering to the total grasp of Modi and Shah on the party. Sinha, however, refused to lay low, in spite of the fact that his son is a sitting BJP MP and a minister in the Modi government. Sinha is also not an Advani loyalist, a qualification that is said to have marred the prospects of several leaders in the party who were at the top echelons before the ascent of Shah and Modi on the national scene. In fact, Sinha was the first among the party's top leaders to push for the selection of Modi as the prime ministerial candidate, way back in January 2013. There is little doubt that his rebellion is primarily against Modi and Shah and then everybody else who is seen to be doing their bidding. This rebellion, therefore, means that somebody who was rooting for Modi to be made the prime ministerial candidate five years ago is now not just disappointed in Modi, but is angry with him. This should be fodder enough for others in the party to ruminate over, with elections just around the corner.",2018-04-23,, Yashwant has come a long way from rooting for Modi as PM to seeing him as threat for democracy | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/yashwant-has-come-a-long-way-from-rooting-for-modi-as-pm-to-seeing-him-as-threat-for-democracy-109518.html

328,Ravi Nair,"Rajindar to his close friends, Sachar Sahab to many, Justice Sachar was to the Manor born. Scion to an illustrious Hindu Punjabi family from Lahore in pre-partition India. He became a life-long socialist in his youth. The West Punjab, now Pakistan's Punjab province gave to post-partition India some fine human beings and committed democratic socialists. Seared by the memory of the killings, mayhem and exodus, they kept their basic humanity, secular and Socialist beliefs intact. Some of his lifelong colleagues were individuals like Prem Bhasin, stalwart of the Socialist movement in India; Hans Raj Gulati, a former MLA from Bannu in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and a senior functionary of the socialist Hind Mazdoor Sabha after Partition; Brij Mohan Toofan, President of the Socialist Party in Delhi until 1977; Ishwar Das Khanna and so many others.  His brother-in-law, veteran Journalist Kuldip Nayar, who survives Justice Sachar though not a formal socialist as the others were, was hewn out of that same earthy wisdom, the deeply humane Punjabi stock. It was this intimate knowledge and affinity of the Muslim psyche that led to the crowning achievement of his life. As Chairperson of Prime Minister’s High Level Committee On Status of Muslims, popularly known as the Sachar Committee, he gave the lie to the vicious propaganda of the Hindutva right that minorities in India were mollycoddled.  Its implementation, scuttled presently by the ruling dispensation, has most of the answers to building a composite Indian identity in a few generations. You cannot deny minorities their share of the economic and social cake in India was his constant refrain both in public and private. His economic philosophy was influenced by his deeply held socialist beliefs. Appalled by the robber barons many of whom masquerade as captains of Indian Industry, he bemoaned the lack of successive governments of adherence to Article 39 of the Indian Constitution, which stated that the State shall ensure, “that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production.” He bemoaned that the fact that the Indian State should invest large sums of public money in non-performing and sick private capital ventures, bringing them back to health and then, horror of horrors, return it back to private management. He reminded those who cared to listen that this alone justified Marx’s taunt that “the State is the Executive Committee of the bourgeois class”.  Apart from his deeply held socialist views, his chairmanship in 1977-78 to review the Companies Act and the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act produced a monumental report that is yet to be implemented in full. His work on the composite identity of Punjabiyat in cooperation with former Prime Minister Inder Gujral, Kuldip Nayar, Patwant Singh, Dr Amrik Singh has not got the due it should have to put a balm on the hurt Sikh psyche in the aftermath of the anti-Sikh pogroms and the attack on the Golden Temple. He was also concerned about the demise of Kashmiriyat. An identity that had been forged by Sheikh Abdullah, Prem Nath Bazaz, Mir Qasim and many others who sought to build a “Naya Kashmir”. An identity that was dead on arrival thanks to the back-room machinations of the security establishments in India and Pakistan.  His last personal and substantive conversation with me was over a year ago on the human rights situation in the Valley. He bemoaned with me the usage of pellet guns against unarmed demonstrators, yet saying that he had no time for those who sought enosis with Pakistan. The answer for him lay in Kashmiriyat. and the going back to the possibilities offered by the back-channel talks between Dr   and General Musharaf. As president of Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), his campaigning against Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and Prevention of Terrorism Act was tireless. Soon after his handing over his office as president of PUCL, he put a lot of energy in trying to revive a broad socialist movement in the country until the day he died. Few know that before he was appointed to the Delhi High Court as an Additional Judge in 1972, he consulted Madhu Limaye and George Fernandes about the offer of the elevation to the Bench. He was keen to contest a parliamentary seat in the Punjab on a socialist ticket. He was told that his chances of being elected were as slim as finding the Holy Grail. The Socialists and the country lost a chance in having a thoughtful Parliamentarian. However, the country gained in a having a fine judge, civil libertarian and humanist.

The government urged it to keep in mind the approaching Ramzan fasting month and and the onset of Monsoon. Senior state officers said they have urged the commission to conduct elections before 13 May.

The apex court directed the BJP to move the high court, refusing to interfere in the process. On 9 April, the original last day for filing nomination, the SEC notified a day's extension but withdrew it the next day, allegedly under government pressure. Meanwhile, Trinamool moved the High Court's Division Bench, which referred the case back to the Single Bench. Friday, Opposition parties expressed satisfaction with the verdict. Trinamool said though the court sought a rescheduling, it hasn't ordered for online filing of nomination or for deployment of central forces. Trinamool parliamentarian Kalyan Bandhyopadhyay, who argued for the party in court, came across aggressive after the verdict. “We will see how the BJP files nominations now that the court has order for an extension,” he said. “The High Court’s order is a victory for democracy.

330,Ashwin Aghor,"The fracas between National Democratic Alliance partners   and   was exposed again Monday. The issue this time was a propsed refinery in Maharashtra's Konkan region. The notification for the refinery was being cancelled, the state's Industry Minister Subhash Desai said at a public meeting at Nanar village in Ratnagiri district, the proposed site. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, however, denied anu such cancellation.  ""As the Industries Minister, I have issued orders to scrap the notification,” Desai said. On the other hand, Fadnavis said: “No minister can cancel the notification like this. That authority is with a high-power committee, which has not received any such proposal.” Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan recently said Saudi Aramco, the biggest exporter of crude oil and natural gas liquids, was willing to buy into the the West Coast Refinery Project. Villagers have opposed the project, citing it's “devastating impact” on mango and catchue cultivation. ""The refinery, once operational, will lead to increase in ambient temperature. This will be fatal for the Alphonso and catchue growers in the region,"" said Nitin Jathar, a villager.  The episode is akin to the impasse on Enron Power Project, which faced similar opposition when proposed by the then Congress government. The BJP had opposed it tooth and nail. Late Gopinath Munde had even gone to the extent of saying that, if voted to power, the BJP would dump the project in the Arabian sea. It was proposed at Dabhol, also in Ratnagiri district. At Monday's meeting, Sena chief   said: ""The BJP was free to take the project to Vidarbha. We will support it. Take it wherever they want, but Konkan. We will not spare anyone who will cause devastation in Konkan. It is the sin of Prime Minister   to impose the project on Konkan."" He said that the so called Acche Din of Prime Minister Modi would prove disaster for Konkan. Thackeray criticised Fadnavis for pressing for the project despite opposition by people. Desai had threatened to resign if the CM forced his way.  Immediately after the announcement, Opposition parties such as Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) came down heavily on Sena for making misleading announcements. Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Radha Krishna Vikhe Patil, said: “The announcement is nothing but a cheap publicity stunt by Shiv Sena. The party has realised that it is losing ground all over the state. It is a last minute efforts to regain some ground.” NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said: “Shiv Sena is fooling people. Any notification has to be cancelled by the approval of cabinet and not on an impulse in a public meeting.” Shiv Sena spokesperson Dr Mahisha Kayande said, “Desai is empowered to cancel the notification as Industries minister. We have expressed the feeling of common man of Konkan.” The project, proposed at the border of Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts, is a joint venture of Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL). It is proposed to be the world’s largest integrated refinery-cum-petrochemicals complex, with a capacity of 60 million metric tonne per annum.  The government expects an investment of $40 billion (about Rs2.6 lakh crore) in the project and would be commissioned by the year 2022.",2018-04-23,," Shiv Sena, BJP lock horns again.

331,Akash Bisht,"Ending long-standing speculation over who would lead the Congress in Madhya Pradesh in the run-up to the 2018 Assembly elections, the party Thursday announced senior leader Kamal Nath as its state unit president. He replaced former Union minister Arun Yadav. The appointment of the nine-time member of Parliament from Chindwara was done with the intent to put an end to factionalism within the state unit, which was considered to be among one of the primary reasons for Congress' disastrous performance in the state. Congress also carefully made other crucial appointments to ensure different factions were equally represented in the party's state unit. Congress' chief whip in Lok Sabha and Guna MP, Jyotiraditya Scindia, has been made the chairman of the campaign committee. While many are considering Nath's elevation as a setback for Scindia, political experts believe that being the campaign committee chief gives the Guna MP opportunity to be a constant feature in party's election campaign, which could see him interact with people across the state and build support for himself. According to experts, Nath's appointment in no way suggests that he could also be the party's chief ministerial candidate. Though he is certainly being considered as the front-runner for the post if the party manages to oust the   (BJP). Ever since the Congress won the recently held assembly bye-elections in Mungaoli and Kolaras, there was a buzz that Scindia could be handed the reigns of the party. In fact, even Nath backed Scindia's name for the state chief. However, all this while, former chief minister Digvijay Singh was busy with his Narmada parikrama and on his return, sources claimed that he put his weight behind Nath, whom he fondly addresses as “elder brother”. This many believe made the Congress rethink on Scindia's candidature in order to avoid any more factionalism. Sources claim that on his return, Singh seemed to have made it clear to the central leadership that he was more comfortable with Nath at the helm of affairs instead of Scindia. Other reasons being attributed to Chhindwara MP making the cut are his deep pockets and organisational skills. Despite being considered an outsider in state politics, Nath's “connections” across the spectrum have made the Congress president rethink on his promise of giving youngsters more opportunities. “On the other hand, Kamal Nath, unlike his buddy 'Diggy Raja', has rarely been spotted in Bhopal. He is seen as an 'outsider' and his influence is limited to 30-40 seats in the southern belt,” wrote Bhavdeep Kang in Firstpost. It is for his “delegating and outsourcing” skills that many believe helped him get the job. “Unlike Scindia, who will have to do all the running now, considering he is the campaign chief, Nath is most likely to sit in his office and delegate work. This isn't necessarily bad for Scindia who will get an opportunity to improve his presence and popularity in the state,” said Harish Divekar, a Bhopal-based political analyst. In fact, sources have informed that Congress President   had a meeting with the three leaders – Nath, Singh and Scindia – where they all asked for a change of guard in the state. In fact, one of the senior-most leaders of MP had confided in this reporter that it was crucial for the Congress to declare a name to ensure that the party stands behind him as it looks to end the 15-year-old rule of the Shivraj Singh Chauhan. “The party workers are in a state of confusion and a decision needs to be taken soon to ensure that we stand behind whoever is chosen by the central leadership. If a decision is not taken soon, we will be in a disadvantageous position,” he had said. Meanwhile, senior state leader Mahendra Joshi welcomed the decision and said Nath was given the charge because of his seniority. He even welcomed party's decision to appoint Scindia as campaign committee chief and said, “The experience and acceptability of Nath and energy of Scindia will invigorate and unite the party. With these appointments, every aspect has been taken care of and as a result the Congress will emerge as a very strong team which will end BJP's misrule in the state,” he said. Along with these two appointments, Congress has also announced the names of four working presidents who hail from different regions and caste groups. Bala Bachhan, Ramnivas Rawat, Jitu Patwari and Surender Choudhary have been appointed as new working presidents of the state unit. Interestingly, the party has accommodated these four on the basis of which camp they belong to. Rawat, from Other Backward Classes, is considered particularly close to Scindia while Patwari, also an OBC, is close to Singh. The other two – Bachhan (Scheduled Tribe) and Choudhary (Scheduled Caste) – are Nath's loyalists. Experts have pointed how the party has not given any representation to either the Thakurs or the Brahmins in these positions. However, they believe that apart from the big three, these four represent different caste groups and regions which should benefit the party in taking on the BJP. “In fact, with these appointments, the Congress has created a perfect mix of region and caste which should help it in the run up to the polls. With these changes, Congress has ensured a close contest with the BJP,” said Divekar. He informed that Patwari comes from Malwa region while Chaudhary, Bachhan and Rawat come from Bundelkhand, Nimar and Chambal regions respectively. According to 2011 census, the state's total population is 7.26 crore, out of which OBC's constitute 51% of the population while SCs constitute 15.51% and STs 21.1%.

Bhutia said he would focus on corruption and unemployment in his home state in theh run-up to next year's Sikkim Assembly elections. “Corruption, unemployment, high suicide rates, youngsters getting into drugs/alcohol and lack of leadership in the state are some of the key issues for me,” Bhutia said. He slammed the current Pawan Chamling-led Sikkim Democratic Front government for approving numerous hydroelectric power projects. “Sikkim has a fragile environment. What is the need to have 29-30 hydel projects? Despite having so many power projects, uninterrupted power supply has still not reached a large part of the state,” he said.  “And while we vouch for organic farming, agricultural lands are being taken away by pharmaceutical companies. We need development, but a sustainable one. Even today, a tarred road has not reached my village,” he added. Alleging corruption under Chamling, Bhutia said the ban on the entry of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the state must be lifted. “If they are clean, they need to prove it,” the football ace said. There has been speculation about Bhutia's political future after he fell out with Trinamool. Some quarters guessed he would join the   (BJP), th party against which he unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Darjeeling and the Siliguri Assembly constituency in 2016.

333,Charu Kartikeya,"It is not for nothing that the appointment of Kamal Nath as chief of  's Madhya Pradesh unit has come as a surprise for many. Nath is 71, has never helmed the party's affairs in the state in any position and had himself endorsed the name of Jyotiradiya Scindia for the party's chief ministerial candidate last September. The return of former MP chief minister Digvijay Singh from his Narmada pilgrimage, however, seems to have changed the situation drastically. It has been widely reported that Singh lent his weight behind Nath, telling the party high command that he would prefer the member of Parliament froom to Scindia. Bang came the announcement: Nath appointed president. Scindia was also given a key charge – head of the campaign committee for the upcoming Assembly elections. In yet another surprise, four working presidents were also appointed, two of them said to be bearing allegiance to Singh. Essentially, in one stroke, all three warring factions of the Congress in MP were accommodated. The objective, so far, is clear – unite squabbling leaders and make all of them work for one goal: defeat three-time CM,  . Ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections also, the party had appointed four working presidents for the state to simultaneously reach out to Dalits, other backward classes, Patels and tribals. However, the PCC chief wasn't changed and Bharat Singh Solanki was asked to continue. No CM face was announced. The strategy could be considered a relative success as the party bettered its performance. The  , in fact, came very close to defeat. It was different in Punjab, where former CM Amarinder Singh was formally designated as the choice for the CM's post. Singh was highly confident of his victory and convinced high command to give him complete charge. He was already serving as PCC chief. The Punjab game-plan was entirely successful and Singh brought the state to the Congress again. Congress President   would be hoping that Kamal Nath will achieve the same feat in MP, helped by rival camps led by Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia. There are rumblings in the state that Nath has also been given the charge as he is the one most likely to bring much-needed funds for the campaign. He declared assets worth over Rs 200 crore in his affidavit filed before the Election Commission in 2014. With a 76-year old CM in Punjab and a 71-year old PCC chief in MP, many feel that Gandhi's original strategy of phasing out the old guard has been turned on its head. However, Gandhi himself had indicated this shift in his speech at the party's plenary last month.  “If the youth have to take the Congress forward, it cannot be done without the experience of the party veterans. My task is to be take them together,” he said at the outset. In MP, with the old guard firmly back in the driver's seat, it remains to be seen how much would the strategy work.

This has led to accusations of the SEC bending over backwards to accommodate the Mamata Banerjee-led government's wish, after much dilly-dallying, deliberations and a legal battle. In fact, Opposition parties might even move court to prevent the single-phase election, which they apprehend would lead to bloodshed. There are fewer police personnel per booths when the entire force needs to be deployed for elections; also police statiosn would not have officers, Opposition parties said. They claimed during filing of nominations many party workers were killed and many could not file. Some commission officials admitted to a shortage of secuity arrangement: there will be only 43,000 armed police and 58,000 other police personnel for 43,067 polling booths and 58,467 polling premises. The poll panel has already informed this to the state government. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee though welcomed the move and urged all parties to keep away from 'false political campaigns'.

335,Rajeev Khanna,"For some time now, people in Punjab are perplexed over the issue of Khalistan and extremism raising its head again and again. Only last week Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh brought it up while meeting Union Home Minister  . Also, representatives of Indus Canada Foundation gave a much more serious dimension to it. Observers have been underlining for quite sometime that the militant movement for Khalistan in Indian Punjab is dead. The idea is alive, though 'marginally', off shore where Khalistani sympathisers keep on organising events and seminars to discuss it at various platforms. One thing that marked the run up to the last year's Punjab Assembly elections is the fact that the discourse over the issue came alive amid allegations and counter allegations of hobnobbing with hardline Sikh elements. It was thought that these were just poll pranks being played by the three main players – the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-  (BJP) combine. But the issue has remained an integral part of Punjab politics ever since with it being played up time and again by none other than the state government. Last Thursday Amarinder urged Rajnath for a comprehensive strategy to tackle the re-emergence of extremism in Punjab, which according to him, is threatening to disturb the peace and stability of the state again. The Punab CM stressed upon the need for the formulation of an all-encompassing strategy to counter emerging extremism and suggested strengthening the intelligence apparatus along with action against foreign handlers based in Canada, United Kingdom, the United States, Italy and Germany who are actively engaged in activities for revival of terrorism in Punjab. Amarinder also underlined the need for countering social media activities aimed at disturbing the peace and stability of the state. He was of the opinion that strengthening the state government’s 'Connect with Your Roots’ programme would help. A Punjab government spokesperson said Rajnath agreed to look into the state’s demands under the Modernisation of Police Forces Scheme (MPF Scheme). Citing the state’s security concerns, Amarinder had reiterated the demand for central assistance in the modernisation of the police forces. He said under MPF, Punjab should be designated a 'Category-A' state for financial assistance with 90:10 centre-state sharing basis on the pattern of Jammu and Kashmir and the eight north-eastern states. He also sought allocation of additional funds to Punjab under the MPF Scheme for strengthening the state's Special Branch for various law-and-order challenges like proxy war, trans-border terrorism and influx of drugs, weapons and explosives. A home ministry spokesperson said Amarinder apprised Rajnath about the situation in Punjab, including issues related to attempts to create disturbances through targeted killings. A number of such killings have taken place over the last one-and-a-half years. Rajnath assured all possible central assistance, as requested by the Punjab government. Amarinder appreciated support being provided by central agencies in investigating these cases. The NIA is carrying out probes into these killings, suspected to be carried out through a criminal conspiracy to disturb communal harmony in the State. On Wednesday Vikram JS Bajwa of Indus Canada Foundation while talking about various NRI issues said the students going abroad for studies, particularly to Canada and the US have been falling in the Khalistani traps.  He said majority of the students going to Canada, their number reaching around 25,000 per quarter, are being sent by their family members after selling off land or other assets. They face financial hardships there or paying their and funding their academics. Thus they are easy prey for Khalistani groups who are fronts of the Pakistani agency ISI.  “The problem is that most of these students just matriculates and are not pursuing professional courses but regular courses. They also face problems in getting jobs. The Khalistani lobbyists are luring them for anti-Punjab and anti-India training,” Bajwa said. He said his organisation has authenticated this to the Punjab Police chief Suresh Arora. He said there is no village-level record available with the government of the students going abroad. In addition to this the Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has no programme to help such students in distress abroad.  He further explained that a large number of students become parts of gangs in Canada and the US that are being run by Khalistani elements. Bajwa claimed that once they get involved in any legal matter they are assured of a long stay there because the local laws do not allow their departure before the said cases are taken to their logical conclusion. He however did not come out with specific instances but claimed that there are around 600 such students on the West Coast of Canada and around 1,000 on the East Coast. This is a new dimension to the issue and can have far reaching ramifications. The manner in which both the Centre and the Amarinder regime 'cold-shouldered' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during his recent visit and how the lobby adamant on raising the Khalistan bogey was successful in its attempts is well known. But what is baffling a large number of Punjabis is that why is Amarinder singing to a tune that is generally perceived to that of the BJP under the leadership of people like Prime Minister   and the party's National President  . There is a strong point of view that Amarinder has been trying to carve out a niche for himself in the 'nationalist politics' that is the flavour of the politics in India since Modi came to power. But a more precise view comes from Dal Khalsa leader Kanwar Pal Singh who said: “The whole issue is about polarising voters along communal lines in Punjab ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress knows that the Sikh vote will be split between the Akalis and them. It wants to consolidate the Hindu vote in its favour by raising the issue of Khalistan again and again.”  The Hindu vote bank had shifted towards the Congress during the assembly polls because of various factors like the AAP leadership being seen close to the Sikh hardliners in Canada, impact of demonetisation on small traders etc. Kanwar Pal Singh further said: “Sikh chief ministers, whether from the Congress or the Akalis, have proved to be the best friends of the centre. They have always contained the anti-Centre sentiment. The Centre has always saddled them with the task of keeping at bay the issues related to separate identity, homeland etc.” There is a wide perception among political observers in Punjab among the non BJP chief ministers in the country, Amarinder is the one who has been echoing BJP's line on such issues to a large extent. Many observers feel that having failed to deliver what he had promised in the run up to the elections, Amarinder has been trying to divert attention by raising the issue of Khalistan.  Whatever the case Amarinder will have to come out with an explanation to debunk all these perceptions to clear the political mist around Khalistan that is once again engulfing Punjab.",2018-05-01,, Why Khalistan keeps raising its head in Punjab's political narrative | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-khalistan-keeps-raising-its-head-in-punjab-s-political-narrative-110879.html
336,Akash Bisht,"A mid-air scare after his plane developed a technical snag has forced Congress president   to vow to undertake the arduous Kailash Mansarovar trek after the Karnataka elections. Speaking to party workers and leaders while launching the Jan Aakrosh Rally in Delhi, the Congress president said that once he feared that his plane is going to crash, he thought of visiting Kailash Mansarovar. The self-claimed 'Shiv Bhakt' will now travel to the mountain that is the mythical abode of Hindu deity Shiva, which many see as yet another attempt by the Congress president of indulging in soft Hindutva politics before the crucial assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh to counter the  's aggressive Hindutva agenda in these states. Earlier, Rahul had embarked on several visits to temples in the run-up to Assembly elections in Gujarat, which political pundits believed did help the Congress in putting up a brave fight against the BJP in Prime Minister  's home state. After its improved performance in Gujarat, Rahul adopted a similar strategy in Karnataka where he was seen visiting multiple temples and mutts in what many think was yet another attempt at playing the soft hindutva card to woo the majority community voters to its fold in this do or die battle. With only 11 days left before the southern state goes to polls, it still remains a mystery whether the gamble to woo the voters with temple runs have succeeded in giving the party an edge over its saffron rivals. Experts believe that unlike Gujarat, there has been negligible impact of his visits to temples with some even questioning Rahul being a factor in the upcoming polls. “It is having no impact whatsoever because voters are well aware that Congress is more secular compared with the BJP. Congress has had a long history, starting with Nehru's idea of secularism and people are aware of Congress' Nehruvian cultural practices.   did say that we are victims of appeasement, which is leading to identity markers becoming problems for political parties. It does not bode well for our democracy,” said Prof Muzzaffar Assadi, who teaches Political Science at Mysuru University. According to him, Rahul's visit to temples and mutts in just ritual symbolism and should not be mistaken with soft hindutva. “Ritual symbolism doesn't carry the meaning of hate or communalism which soft Hindutva to an extent does. There is a consensus amongst voters in Karnataka that Congress is trying to woo them through ritual symbolism and not soft Hindutva. Soft Hindutva must have worked in Gujarat but no one in Karnataka bothers about it,” he added. He also thinks that even if the Congress may want to transform, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will not. He would continue to carry forward the legacy of secularism. Assadi added, “He symbolises liberalism, intellectualism and secularism and the main fight in the state is between Siddaramaiah's subaltern model and BJP's divisive agenda.” Meanwhile, Professor Narendar Pani, who teaches Political Science at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru, disagreed with Congress indulging in soft Hindutva politics in the state. According to him, former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi often visited temples and mutts in the state and that there is nothing new to what Rahul is doing. “It's only the media that is labelling such visits as soft Hindutva. These visits are nothing but reactions to Congress being portrayed as an anti-Hindu party. Soft Hindutva has no role in Karnataka and elections are being fought on local issues. I don't know whether Rahul is even a factor in these elections,” Pani pointed. According to him, the logic of it working in Gujarat cannot be applied here in Karnataka. “The same brush can't be used for every state. It might have worked in Gujarat but not in Karnataka,” Pani said while pointing that Rahul has also visited several dargahs in the state and no one seems to be bringing that up. When asked that dargahs are known to attract people of all faiths unlike mosques, Pani countered, “If we use that logic than mutts are also not temples.” Interestingly, a Congress leader from the state concurred that these temple visits seem to have created a negative impact on some of the party's traditional voters. Speaking on the request of anonymity, he said, “We were Hindu earlier as well so why this need to prove that we are more Hindu now. This is making some traditional voters angry because they are asking: Were they not Hindus when they won in the past? Why do you have to prove that you are a Hindu now. Visiting temples and mutts has been there for ages in the Gandhi family,” he said. According to him, the party has fallen in the trap laid out by the BJP, which has succeeded in saying that Gandhis are not Hindus. “We are all Hindus so where does the question even arrive? Only that will help us in winning elections would be a pro-poor image. They should realise that they can't fight BJP on the Hindutva plank,” he added. Citing victories of 2004 and 2009, he asked, “We never visited any temples or mosques back then and still won. We lost in 2014 because our leaders had become corrupt and lost connect with the workers. Now, these seniors want to put all blame on Rahul by saying that you were indulging in appeasement and it can only be undone by visit to temples. If they thought visiting temples would help them win, why didn't they do it themselves.” Amid all this, there are also talks of Muslims feeling alienated by Congress' move of playing the soft Hindutva card and could possibly support another party. Assadi dismissed such claims and asserted that Muslims, who form 18% of the population, feel that the BJP remain their No 1 enemy. “They have this fear that if BJP wins yet another term at the state and the Center, their personal and physical security is at stake. In Karnataka, the perception is that if BJP comes to power, it could be the end of their community's freedom, cultural practices, among others. Such fear psychosis has been created in the state. BJP is seen more as a monster than a political entity,” Assadi added. Even Congress leader echoes similar views and said that the community will vote for the Congress en-masse. According to him, once Modi begins his visit to the state, the bond between Congress and Muslims would strengthen further. As far as the   (Secular) is concerned, Assadi believes that Muslims won't prefer them over Congress because of them being a “non-dependable and non-trustworthy ally”. He said, “Post-Babri Masjid demolition, Muslims felt uncomfortable under the Congress government and went on to support the likes of  , Bahujan Samaj Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal etc, which led to marginalisation of the party in the north. However, we never had any communal riots because we are a much tolerant society. That is the reason why such marginalisation of Congress did not happen here. This time around Muslims realise that if the BJP has to be kept out at power at both the Centre and state, they need to back the Congress.”",2018-04-30,, Kailash and temple run: Does Congress need soft Hindutva and will that work | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/kailash-and-temple-run-does-congress-need-soft-hindutva-and-will-that-work-110763.html
337,Anurag Dey,"The charter of demands by the NCSPA includes:On a day when the world celebrated Labour Day, Dalits and tribals along with Leftist leaders from across the country held demonstrations across India to make a powerful statement against the Supreme Court’s verdict that diluted Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. A collective of more than 500 Dalit and Adivasi organisations collected under the banner of 'National Coalition for Strengthening Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act' (NCSPA). They marked Tuesday as 'National Resistance Day', demanding that the   Government to either through Judicial or Parliamentary recourse, restore the status of the SC/ST Act as before the apex court’s 20 March judgment. National Resistance Day was observed in over 70 cities across 22 states, where Dalits and tribals along with rights activists and left politicians flayed the apex court and the Modi-led government over the verdict and called for intensifying the movement against it. This comes after the 2 April nationwide shutdown called by the organisation against the verdict. Harping on the “abuse of the Act by vested interests”, an apex court Bench of Justices AK Goel and UU Lalit, in the verdict issued directions in effect diluting the provisions related to immediate arrest for offences under the Act. Besides removing the mandate of immediate arrest under the Act, the   that arrest can be made only after preliminary inquiry and sanction by the competent authority. It also removed the “absolute bar” on an accused taking recourse to anticipatory bail. Faced with growing outrage over the verdict, the Modi government filed a review petition before the SC urging the bench to reconsider its verdict. The apex court is slated to hear the review petition on 3 May. The NCSPA as also the Kerala Government too filed a petition seeking review/ recall of the 20 March judgment.  The NCSPA demonstration in the national capital saw the participation of several political leaders, including Communist Party of India's Rajya Sabha member D Raja, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Brinda Karat and Congress parliamentarian Pradeep Tamta.  Flaying the Modi government over the rising atrocities and crimes against Dalits, Raja dared the Centre to convene a special session of Parliament to discuss the issue and pass an ordinance to negate the verdict. “The SC judgement has virtually made the SC/ST Act redundant. We wanted to raise the issue in Parliament, but the Prime minister and the Government was not willing to debate. So they did not allow Parliament to function. Modi is blaming the Opposition for Parliament not functioning, but it’s them who did not want to it to function,” Raja said. “It’s being said the government is planning to move an ordinance to negate the judgment. If it is so, if the government is really sincere then why don’t they convene a special session of Parliament for this? But they will not do that, because this government is anti-Dalit this government is anti-worker,” said Raja referring to reports of the Centre planning to take the ordinance route. Union minister and the National Democratic Alliance's Dalit face   has said the government will issue an ordinance to uphold the rights SCs and STs if the Supreme Court does not go back on its judgment. Taking on the apex court, Karat said the judgment was a blow to social justice and strengthened the caste system. “The SC used this case to strike a blow to the country’s social justice and the decades of struggles against the caste system. Lakhs of cases are pending before the Supreme Court for years, but in this case, magically the SC came out with verdict within few months of the petition being filed. “It’s not just the SC but the government too played its part in this. The government preferred to remain a mute spectator and only filed the review petition only after faced with intense protests,” said Karat. Spelling out the NCSPA’s charter of demands, National Convener VA Ramesh Nathan said the onus was on the Modi government to set things right. “Rather than confining itself to the petition that was filed over caste discrimination, the SC went beyond and came out with a verdict which has diluted the PoA Act. It’s time for the Centre to act and ensure the law is restored like before. This can be done either through judicial process by revoking the judgment or through parliament by way of an ordinance,” he said.",2018-05-01,," Dalits, tribals turn 1 May into Resistance Day against dilution of SC/ST Act | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/dalits-tribals-turn-1-may-into-resistance-day-against-dilution-of-sc-st-act-110927.html
338,Akash Bisht,"A new challenge has cropped up for the   in Punjab: several legislators from scheduled castes as well as other backward classes have indicated a rebellion against Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for not being adequately represented in his Cabinet.  Trouble began after Singh expanded his Cabinet but did not accommodate any of these 10 members of the Legislative Assembly. Several Dalit MLAs alleged that he preferred loyalists at the cost of merit and seniority. They highlighted that Jat Sikhs, who constitute 25% of the state's population, secured eight ministries but SCs, with 32.5% population, got only three. Backward classes (19%) were not allotted a single portfolio. “We met at Punjab Technical Education Minister Charanjit Singh Channi's house Tuesday where we raised these issues. It was decided that we will write to the CM and await his response,” a Dalit MLA told Catch. He added that earlier they visited Delhi to raise the issue with Congress President  , who asked them to wait: “We have been assured by Rahul and we take his word seriously. However, we think that the chief minister is not serious about it and it is for this reason that we have decided to raise this again and again till some action is taken.” In fact, other legislators have also met Rahul and raised their concerns over the issue but that has not helped their cause. Another MLA, who was part of the delegation that met Rahul, said how they would not take any extreme step since that would destabilise the government and not bode well for the party in the upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. “We are not here to break the party but we want to remind the chief minister that we are also part of this party and should not be ignored like this. If he wants to keep his loyalists happy that is fine but he should also think about us and the communities we represent. If they don't think about that, the party might lose support of Dalit voters in the Lok Sabha elections,” said another legislator. At the meeting at Channi's place the MLAs also discussed how the government waived off loans of prosperous Jat Sikh farmers but ignored the poorer ones, particularly agricultural labourers, also Dalits. “If you can waive off loans worth Rs 2 lakh of prosperous farmers, you should also think about these poor farmers who would be content with even Rs 20,000,” another MLA said. Among a total 31 legislators from the communities only three are in the Cabinet of 18. The rebellion was triggered by the Amarinder government's decision to nominate only five Dalits for the 125 posts of law officers. Shamsher Singh Dullo, who represents the Grand Old Party in Rajya Sabha and is a Dalit, claimed the community has been denied its share since Independence. “For 70 years, we have failed to ensure representation of Dalits in jobs, forget ministries. Even now they are not allowed to enter temples or gurudwaras. I just want the Punjab government and the chief minister to fulfill the promises made to people in its manifesto,” he said. He also alleged that a scam was in the making in the state regarding scholarships to backward caste students. “Children are not getting scholarships, forcing them to discontinue studies. The Punjab government has not been issuing SC certificates to many such students. I have raised it with the SC/ST Commission, which has promised to look into it,” he added. Boasting the highest density of Dalit population among states, these developments in Punjab don't bode well for the party that have constantly being attacking the   government over Dalit issues. With Punjab being the only Congress-ruled state that has such a sizeable population of Dalits, a rebellion of this sort would certainly put the party on the back foot before it approaches crucial elections in several states where caste plays a major factor.",2018-05-03,, Punjab Congress faces rebellion over lack of representation for Dalits | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/punjab-congress-faces-rebellion-over-lack-of-representation-for-dalits-111154.html
339,Rajeev Khanna,"Ever since   led the   to a thumping victory in the 2014 General Elections, several political parties have tried taking on the saffron party's might with varying degrees of success. Now it seems the momentum is shifting towards non-party structures. A conglomeration of progressive groups including trade unions, student bodies, farmers' associations, women's groups and Dalit organisations besides other civil society formations and non-governmental organizations have formed a collective called Jan Ekta Jan Adhikar Andolan Manch (Jejaam). Its affiliates plan mass-mobilization from May 17-22 at hyper-local levels across the country to culminate in demonstrations and rallies up to sub-divisional levels on May 23. The thrust will be to highlight unfulfilled promises made by the Modi and his party in the run-up to the previous Lok Sabha elections. The initiative in fact has adopted a slogan 'Modi ke char saal, pol khol halla bol' (Four years of Modi, get the truth out and sound the cry). The initiative follows the celebration of May Day this year as Resistance Day by Dalit organisations across the country to express resentment against the dilution of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Jejaam activists said they have realised the need for collective action – a la trade unions – to take on the government that has behaved in a “dictatorial method denying the marginalised societies their rights achieved after sustained struggle”.  According to them, various segments of the society need to be told that their goals are interlinked and they need to come together for a common cause: Trade unions must take up issues of students; students need to support farmers; farmers should speak for workers and so on. They underlined that students, women, farmers, labourers and others come out from common families and their issues cannot be looked at separately in the light of the fact that the government has been standing with the perpetrators of violence and those who have been exploiting the common masses. “The country is witnessing an attack on the common man from all sides. If we talk about farmers, there is a policy attack on them from all sides. Every political party has been promising about implementing the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission on agriculture but no one has come forward to do it,” said Communist Party of India's ND Ranaut at a Jejaam meeting in Solan, Himachal Pradesh. “The country has now seen some powerful movements by the farmers in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab. They have been fired upon, but the governments had to accept their demands. The most recent example is the historic march from Nasik to Mumbai that began with 25,000 participants and gradually swelled to double that number. The government was on its knees before they even held their rally,” he added. Citing Himachal, he said: “This small district exports tomatoes worth at least Rs 70 crore; yet there is no food processing unit here, no minimum support price mechanism and no proper insurance.  NC Shandil, a senior functionary of Himachal Pradesh Transport Workers Union, pointed out that though the number of buses with the state government has doubled, the number of employees remain the same. “Those who enrolled for skill development programmes and trained in driving are being paid a paltry stipend and are being used to run the show. They work for a minimal amount in the hope of that elusive regular employment.” Attacking the National Pension Scheme he questioned why was the Modi government not getting lawmakers to first enrol for it instead before hardselling it to common workers. Jagdish Chandra Bharadwaj from All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) said steps were underway to demolish trade unions. “Once they bring about the 'fixed-term employment' trade unions would obviously become redundant. In the garb of fixed-term employment where labour is laid off after a fixed term and then others are hired the government plans to spruce up its employment figures. “There is a move to do away with Industrial Disputes Act and Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Act. People need to be told that such laws that give them some security were promulgated after long struggles,” he added. People also must know how the  , the ideological fountainhead of the BJP, and its affiliates were intruding into institutions at the smallest level. “I was a part of the initiative to set up an Employees State Insurance Specialty Hospital in the Nalagarh-Barotiwala-Baddi industrial area. Today the people at the helm of affairs include one from RSS, one from BJP and one from Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS),” he said. Representatives of youth organisations pointed out how a whole new narrative was being given by various right-wing groups to the debate on reservation in jobs and how Dalits were being vilified. They also highlighted the right-wing campaigns on recent rapes in Kathua and Unnao. “People need to be told how Dalits are being painted as villains for joblessness to cover up for the failure of the government to generate jobs. Similarly on the issue of rapes they have been saying why so much noise was made only on Kathua and Unnao rapes while rapes are being reported elsewhere also. We will tell the people that Kathua and Unnao became major movements because people from various right wing groups were defending the rapists instead of the victims,” said Ajay Bhatti, a youth leader who had also contested the last Himachal Assembly polls on youth-centric issues. Many feel that the initiatives like Jejaam are movements at the micro level that might go under reported but have a potential to counter the micro management in which Sangh Parivar has been taking a lot of pride. The activists point out that the movements at local level, particularly in semi-rural and rural areas do rattle those in power. There is also a view that these can contribute a lot in bringing together progressive political forces together in the long run, an issue that has been gaining importance over the years.",2018-05-07,, Mass organisations come together to count Modi's failure | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/mass-organisations-come-together-to-count-modi-s-failure-112011.html
340,Charu Kartikeya,"A brazen display of communal bigotry and majoritarian bullying is cocking a snook at rule of law at a place barely 15 kilometres from the national Capital. The men and women responsible are usual suspects – radical Hindutva elements who quickly gang up to paint a fake picture of Hindu victimhood. On 26 April, police in Gurgaon arrested six people for disrupting a gathering of Muslims collectively offering namaz at a vacant plot in the city. The arrested men, identified in a video recording of the incident, were chanting 'Jai Sri Ram' and 'Radhe Radhe' while abusing the people assembled there, and asking them to stop the namaz and leave the plot (http://indianexpress.com/article/india/disruption-of-friday-namaaz-in-gurgaon-six-people-arrested-5152491/). Even as the men have now been released on bail, Hindutva activists are up in arms. Local members of Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad,   and other Hindutva organisations were quick to organise themselves under the banner of an outfit that they named Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti. That can be loosely translated into Joint Committee for Hindu Struggle. Struggle for what, may one ask? For the right to take law into one's own hands? For the power to frighten people of other faiths and tell them that they are second-class citizens? This platform has already achieved two of its objectives. The arrested men have been released on bail and the number of Muslims gathering at that plot has dropped significantly. Emboldened, the Samiti is now asking for more – quash the charges against the accused and impose a city-wide ban on reading namaz in the open. In fact, Samiti members have demanded from the state government through a letter that “Rohingyas and Bangladeshis residing in Gurgaon” should be identified and marked, “permission should not be given to read namaz in Hindu colonies” and “permission should only be given in those places where the strength of 'this' population is more than 50%”. “Otherwise”, the letter threatens, “there will continue to be a possibility of peace being obstructed.” The brazen communalism in these demands can not be overlooked. Why should Rohingyas and “Bangladeshis” be marked? Why should Muslims be obstructed from offering namaz in “Hindu colonies”? What is this awful construct that these people are referring to as “Hindu colonies”? Why can't Muslims or people of any other faith pray in the presence of Hindus? Are kirtans, jagratas and 'chowkis' held in Hindu-only colonies? Don't temples come up at the most mundane of places and are simply accepted by the community? The dangerous demands that the Samiti is making will not only encourage ghettoisation of Muslims, they will further divide the society that is already polarising at a rapid pace. Muslim-only neighbourhoods also render the residents deeply vulnerable in times of communal riots. From where are these people getting the power to make such demands so vocally? The formation of this Samiti and its phoney struggle is not too different from the way Hindutva sympathisers formed the Hindu Ekta Manch in Jammu's Kathua. The Manch was formed to express solidarity for the men charge-sheeted by Jammu police for raping and killing an 8-year old Muslim Bakkarwal girl. Members of the Manch are demanding the release of the accused and a CBI probe into the case. This Manch received open backing from a range of BJP leaders, including members of legislative assembly and ministers. While the BJP sacked two of these ministers after facing uproar, the local MLA who also backed the Manch and its demands has now been inducted into the state Cabinet. Another MLA, recently promoted to the position of deputy chief minister, has called the incident a 'minor' one. There is no ambiguity around BJP's support to the narrative that the Manch has been trying to propagate. This is the source of power for such platforms. They receive direct support from the larger Sangh Parivar because they act as foot-soldiers of its campaign. So, while the prime minister will try to get away by coining empty slogans like “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas” and citing the Quran in his speeches, foot-soldiers of the Parivar will keep carrying out such campaigns on the ground. These campaigns are designed to keep the minorities perpetually scared and they must not go unchallenged.",2018-05-01,, The namaz incident in Gurgaon means Jammu-style bigotry on open display | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/pov/the-namaz-incident-in-gurgaon-means-jammu-style-bigotry-on-open-display-110937.html
341,Riyaz Wani,"As the Jammu and Kashmir Cabinet reshuffle brought in new ministerial faces, including new Deputy Chief Minister Kavinder Gupta, all seemed well with the coalition between   and People's Democratic Party. But Gupta struck a discordant note, terming the Kathua rape and murder “a minor incident” – displaying yet again the ideological strain between the parties that keeps betraying itself at the unlikeliest of occasions. It also gives a measure of how the tension would be like when the situation isn't going well, for example, during the deeply polarising three-month-long campaign in support of the accused in the Kathua crime. And this, at times, does push the alliance to breaking point. Only a fortnight ago, on 14 April, the ruling PDP had gone into a huddle in Srinagar, following renewed complications in its coalition with the BJP over Kathua. The saffron party's attitude was ambivalent towards the accused; some of its leaders still backing the protests in Jammu in favour of a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation, had become a source of embarrassment for the PDP in Kashmir Valley, its core constituency. The PDP was also sore about the continuing killings of the civilians in protests, seen largely as the outcome of the Centre’s iron-fist approach towards the Valley. Several PDP leaders spoke in favour of a break-up with the BJP to arrest the detrimental fallout of the alliance on the political base of the party. But in the end the party resolved to continue with the coalition after senior leaders cited the resignations of two BJP ministers – Chaudary All Singh and Chander Prakash Ganga – who had earlier participated in the rally of the Hindu Ekta Manch in favour of the accused. The coalition partners have now reconciled again, forced by the inherent dynamics of J&K politics, compulsions of their respective electoral mandates and of course the mutual convenience. The truth is that the PDP-BJP coalition has completed four years in power. The first year was under the chief ministership of the late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed – a year of relentless political tug-of-war which often pushed the state to the brink. In its second wind under  , the turmoil has been no less. After unsuccessfully trying to hold the BJP to its terms in the Agenda of Alliance during the three months of her conditional refusal to join it, Mehbooba reconciled to the state of affairs. Ever since she has, more or less, submitted to the BJP’s belligerent politics and at times ideological overreach. In the process her political stock has been declining. The BJP, backed by its government in New Delhi, has dictated the state’s policies in the past four years, and its agenda and discourse: on the Kashmir solution, a strict integrationist policy has replaced the PDP's pitch for the resolution of Kashmir, which in rhetorical terms sometimes bordered on soft separatism. The BJP has hijacked the local political discourse by ensuring that a steady stream of issues and controversies are initiated and controlled by it even on issue as indefensible as the rape and murder of the eight-year-old girl. This, in turn, has squeezed the play of not only the separatist narrative but also that of the local mainstream politics. And as for the development of the state, a prospect that had lent the PDP-BJP coalition it's biggest rationale, only around Rs 14,000 crore of the much-hyped Rs 80,000-crore package announced by Prime Minister   in November 2015 has been released in the three years since. Where does the coalition go from here? Nothing can be said with certainty. After having been together for four years and endured the consequences of their ideological divergence – albeit predominantly to the detriment of the PDP – there's no reason that it should break. More so, when there is little to gain from such a break-up. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's political standing has plunged to an extent where it cannot even hope to claim political martyrdom. There is another problem and that is, the TINA factor. The PDP often presses it in its defence: There Is No Alternative. “Whether the coalition will last is not the right question. Whether there is a substitute in the system is,”Works Minister and J&K Government spokesman Naeem Akhtar told Catch. “We have to bear in mind the complexities of the state. Unless you give every region, every community a sense of participation and a consequent sense of empowerment, there's no other option to go about this"". When asked if the BJP’s losing the 2019 national election make a difference to the PDP’s preferences, Akhtar said the PDP was looking forward to Modi winning again. He said even if Modi were to lose the poll, it won't impact the J&K coalition. “This is a state arrangement. Truth is you can't keep one region out of the power structure. We have a mandate for six years. The mandate is such that it is region-specific for all parties. Can you afford to keep anybody out of the system?” Akhtar said. Though traditionally the electoral arithmetic arising from the demographics guaranteed the Valley its political primacy, the existing political mandate has upset the chessboard. In the last Assembly election, the majority Hindu community in Jammu voted en masse for the BJP, giving it 25 out of the province’s 37 seats, thus making the Hindu nationalist party a significant political actor in the state and a necessary part of the state’s governing structure. But in the Valley, the much-fancied PDP pulled off just 25 of the 46 seats, with others being divided up inequitably among the National Conference, Congress, People’s Conference, Awami Itihad Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The PDP was helped along to its final tally of 28 by its wins in three seats from the Muslim-majority areas of Jammu. Akhtar denied that the BJP was running away with the political agenda in the state. “It varies from event to event. And some things are inbuilt into the political structure of the state. You have to see it in its perspective. You can’t take it away from its historical background,” Akhtar said adding the PDP had ensured it doesn’t compromise on its own ideology and had taken steps to defend it. “There is now only one voice in the country which seeks peace with Pakistan and which is that of Mehbooba Mufti. Even liberal political voices in the country don’t ask for it”. And to the question that the BJP had yet to fulfil its commitments in the Agenda of Alliance, Akhtar agreed that the “eco-system”, which was necessary for such a fulfilment had not been created. “Kashmir is what it was pre-2003. But during Vajpayee regime, the atmosphere had changed, ecosystem had changed. There was peace. There was exchange of delegations. It was trade. It was opening of routes. That process has halted”. Despite such issues, Akhtar said the coalition will go on as there is no alternative. But with the country due to go into an election mode in a few months, Kashmir could become a hunting ground for the political parties looking for issues to rally public support in the rest of the country. And this could include attempts at polarisation too. So, the task of the PDP to hang on to the BJP might get only tougher.",2018-05-03,," Despite Kathua, polarisation, PDP-BJP coalition looks strong.

342,Sulagna Sengupta,"The dismal state of security in Bengal before large-scale Panchayat elections has become even more apparent – a sizeable section of the state government's employees have now sought proper security for polling. While some of these employees owe allegiance to opposition parties, some are also affiliated with the ruling Trinamool Congress. The government staff apprehend violence and are concerned about their safety as it will be them who will eventually have conduct the polling process at the ground level, whenever electiosn are held. As of now, the Calcutta High Court is yet to okay 14 May as the date of polling, proposed by the state election commission (SEC). There has been rampant violence in West Bengal during the process of filing of nominations, with all major opposition parties alleging that their candidates were forcibly kept away from filing nominations. So much so that in more than a third of seats, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's party is set to win unopposed. The widespread violence has even raised concerns about the lack of democratic space in the state and several quarters have criticised the government. Paradoxically it still enjoyed a lot of support for its scheme, according to a recent survey by a leading media house in the state otherwise critical of the government. This violence seems to have spooked the governent staff who apprehended more on polling day. “Employees are afraid to go on polling duty after violence during filing of nominations. We have urged the SEC to provide adequate security to polling personnel,” said Manoj Chakraborty, convenor of Trinamool-backed Employees Federation. He demanded that the government announces a compensation of Rs 20 lakh for the family in case any staff member dies on duty. Bijay Shankar Sinha, general secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist)-backed State Co-ordination Committee of West Bengal said there were plans to meet election commissioner Amarendra Singh Thursday. “We have already sent a deputation to the commission demanding adequate security.” He underscored that that proper security cover would be necessary for around 2.5 lakh polling personnel to be deployed in around 58,467 polling stations in 20 districts. “We feel that for each polling premise there should be an armed police personnel and in the polling booth there should be at least four police officers,” he said and added that families of polling personnel were really worried.",2018-05-03,, Everybody is afraid of Bengal Panchayat polls.

343,Rajeev Khanna,"Along with the summer temperature, politics in Haryana too has started soaring. With the wheat harvest over and barely a year to go for both the Lok Sabha and state Assembly elections, key political parties have started shifting gears. Their leaderships are announcing political programmes one after the other. After the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) drew first blood recently by announcing a pre poll alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party ( ), the remaining two political forces – the   (BJP) and the Congress too have made their political moves by initiating programmes. The Aam Aadmi Party ( ) which has been a rank outsider till now is also making noises aiming to draw its pound of flesh in the forthcoming electoral battle. The Congress has been the most active in the state albeit in a divided manner. This remains the key concern for its supporters who have been pointing out that the people at this point of time are in favour of the Congress but the divided leadership may squander away the window of opportunity that has emerged. Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda who remains the most powerful Congress leader in the state has announced a 'Jan Kranti Yatra' from Panipat 3 June onwards. He plans to cover every constituency under this Yatra in the days to come, raising issues pertaining to farmers, poor, labourers and the youth. He had earlier decided to start this Yatra in February but had to postpone it following a fracture that he had sustained immediately after its launch from Hodal. Hooda has been gunning for both the ruling BJP government under Manohar Lal Khattar as well as the INLD leadership. Responding to the INLD-BSP pre poll pact he said, “The pact will break before the polls like it had in 1998. What can one say about the INLD that has been entering into pacts with BJP, BSP and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) one after the other.” He has been scathing in his attacks on the BJP questioning the performance of the government both in the state as well as in the centre on issues like job generation, addressing concerns of the farmers, repeated failures on the law and order front and its reliance on caste and communal polarisation for electoral benefits. Meanwhile, the state Congress chief Ashok Tanwar who heads another Congress faction has also announced his programmes that include a Dalit Mahasammelan at Karnal on May 27. It needs to be pointed that Karnal is the home turf of Khattar and Tanwar wants to score brownie points by holding the event there. Karnal and its adjoining areas have been in the news for instances of Dalit atrocities.  It is a two-pronged attack that Tanwar plans to launch in the state. While taking on the Khattar regime at the chief minister's home turf on issues pertaining to Dalits, he has also announced to undertake the second leg of his Cycle Yatra in Sirsa district which happens to be the stronghold of the INLD. This leg of the Yatra will be carried out from May 17-21 mainly covering Sirsa district that is spread over one tenth of Haryana's geographical area and is the biggest district in the state. The Yatra will also pass through Chautala village which is the home of Chautala family that is at the top of the INLD hierarchy. These initiatives will later be carried out in other districts as well in the days to come. Tanwar intends to raise issues like farm distress and demand for loan waiver, the Staff Selection Commission scam that rocked thee state recently and the effort of the government to cover up various scams including the activities of the mining mafia in the river beds and in areas adjoining the Aravalli mountain range. “We will also be taking up issues of the continuing atrocities against the officials from both the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes that have been coming to light. It has come to light that officials from these communities are not being given important posts,” he said. Not to be left behind, the BJP with Khattar as its government head is also shifting gears. Khattar has started holding road shows in various parts of the state. He has started camping in villages overnight chairing 'Gram Chaupals', breaking bread in Dalit households and promoting schemes launched by his government among the masses. He recently held two such programmes in Yamunanagar and Karnal districts. He has started showcasing the achievements of his government while conveying to the people that there is no paucity of funds in Haryana for development. He plans to soon enter the districts in the Jat heartland that are the stronghold of the Congress and the INLD. He has been interacting with rural masses to check the ground realities of the schemes launched under the ‘Gram Swaraj Abhiyan’. The ruling BJP has also reportedly drawn a road map to carry out party programmes across the state in the next two months. These are aimed at reaching out to the people and apprising them of the government programmes and achievements in the last four years.  The INLD-BSP combine have launched a 'Jail Bharo' agitation from 1 May with main focus on the the emotive issue of completion of the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal on which it is targeting both the Congress and the BJP. It is also playing up the issue of water scarcity and the failures of the recent Congress and the present BJP regimes of addressing it. Its leaders have been saying that the Government of India which has been directed by the Supreme Court to complete the construction of the SYL canal has been sitting over the directive even after the final disposal of the dispute for the past eighteen months. They have been accusing the centre and the state government of conspiring against the interests of Haryana. Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Abhay Singh Chautala has stated that the central and the state governments do not seem to realise that Haryana is staring at a man-made disaster by delaying the legitimate share to it from the river waters. He reminded that even at this moment south Haryana has slipped into ‘dark zone’ in context of groundwater. “Much of the development in that region was undertaken because of the belief that the water needs of the region, both agricultural and residential, would be adequately met with the waters from rivers through SYL canal when it would reach these areas. Now that it appears that the BJP, both in New Delhi and the state, is insensitive to the needs of the people of the state, it appears that this region is on the brink of becoming barren,” he said. Even AAP is gearing to make its presence felt on the political map of the state. After an impressive rally and road show of party's national convener and Delhi chief Minister   a few weeks ago, the party is in the process of formalizing an organisational structure in the state. The party's state chief Naveen Jaihind has stated that the party leadership will be traveling across all the 90 constituencies soon. The party has also started the process of shortlisting potential candidates. It is just a matter of time before campaign picks up in this state that is known for its sharp politics across India.",2018-05-05,, Political temperature starts soaring in Haryana as parties line-up programmes | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/political-temperature-starts-soaring-in-haryana-as-parties-line-up-programmes-111629.html
344,Anurag Dey,"Seven Opposition parties including the Congress had brought an impeachment motion against the CJI on five grounds of “misbehavior” including “forgery” and “abuse of exercise of power”. Naidu, on 23 April refused to admit the notice of the motion saying that the documents annexed to the motion “do not make out a case which can lead any reasonable mind to conclude that the Chief Justice of India on these facts can be ever held guilty of misbehavior”.A petition challenging Rajya Sabha Chairman M  's rejection of an impeachment motion against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra was withdrawn on Tuesday after a five-judge Bench set up to hear the matter, refused to divulge details of the order constituting the Bench. The petition was filed by Congress Rajya Sabha members Partap Singh Bajwa and Amee Yajnik and contended that the rejection of the motion is “ex facie illegal, arbitrary and violated Article 14 of the Constitution” and hence should be quashed. The petition claimed that Naidu “in utmost haste and in the most illegal and arbitrary manner and against the settled law on the subject, rejected the notice of motion”. It also sought setting up a committee to investigate into the allegations made against the CJI. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the petitioners, pleaded the five-judge Bench to provide a copy of the order constituting the Bench. But the Bench insisted him to argue the case on merits and refused to give details. After over half-an-hour of arguments and counter arguments, the petition was withdrawn. Later interacting with the media, Sibal informed that he had mentioned the matter on Monday before the court of Justice J Chelameswar, who had asked him to come on (Tuesday). But on Monday evening the case was listed for hearing by a five judge Bench comprising Justices AK Sikri, SA Bobde, NV Ramanna, Arun Mishra and AK Goel. “Yesterday (Monday) evening we got to know about the formation of the five-judge Bench. On what basis this order (to constitute the Bench) was made, who made it, we did not know. Because there is no judicial order,” said Sibal. He said that reference to a five judge Bench is made only when the matter involves deciding a substantial question of law involving the interpretation of the Constitution. “The Supreme Court Rules do not permit the Chief Justice to pass an order in this behalf on the administrative side. Never before has a petition been referred to a five-judge Bench immediately on filing and by an administrative order,” said Sibal informing about the court proceedings. “We needed to be informed about who constituted this Bench, who passed this order. If the CJI did, then give us a copy of the order. It is our constitutional right to know who passed the order. Unless we get a copy of the order, how can we challenge it,” asked Sibal. He said on the refusal of the court to clarify about the constitution of the Bench, the petition was withdrawn. He also asserted that there was no politics involved in the matter. “We don’t have any personal grievances against any judge, we want to protect the court’s independence. But at the same time we want the judicial process to be transparent. We want to ensure the process is not polluted and they is pure. “We did not raise any political matter, we are being accused of being against the judiciary, but the matter we raised is not connected with politics, it is purely a legal matter,” added Sibal. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who played a key role in the impeachment motion, in a series of tweets claimed the CJI “illegally” constituted the five-judge Bench.

345,Rajeev Khanna,"Politics in Punjab is on the boil again. This time the issue pertains to the alleged dilution of Sikh history in the school textbooks for Classes 11 and 12. The issue is all set to gather steam in the days to come given its emotive nature. One must keep in mind the distinct character of Punjab when it comes to such issues, no matter how big or small they are. This is a border state where a national minority is in majority. It is a state that has witnessed a lot of turmoil over issues of Sikh identity and homeland and these issues still form a part of political narrative. The political battle began with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) firing the first salvo and former education minister Dr Daljit Singh Cheema accusing the state's own school board of expunging the history makers of Punjab from the history books. He said the move could be part of a deep rooted conspiracy to rob the future generations of Punjabis from knowledge about the history of Sikh Gurus and Sikh warriors of Punjab. He said there were 23 chapters carrying information about Sikh Gurus, Sikh warriors and historical facts about Punjab in the class twelve history book that have been removed illogically and replaced with a half page description about the glorious period of Sikh history. “This is intolerable as it amounts to playing with the sentiments of the Sikh community and purposefully ignoring the contributions of the Sikh gurus in the history of the country,” he said while pointing that the new book has also done injustice to Punjabis by ignoring their stellar role in the freedom struggle as well as their contributions to safeguard the unity and integrity of the country. The main Opposition party, the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) too joined the issue with its leadership collectively pointing that the move of Punjab State Education Board (PSEB) to remove the chapters related to the history of Sikh gurus and their teachings, Anglo-Sikh wars, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Sikh struggle against Mughals and Ahmad Shah Abdali and the origin and growth of Sikh Misls etc will isolate the youth of Punjab from glorious past of Sikhism in particular and Punjab as a whole. Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh was quick to dismiss these 'malicious' allegations and claimed that courses had merely been realigned with the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus to enable the students from Punjab to compete at the national level. He claimed that the history chapters had been now spread across Classes XI and XII, on the recommendation of an expert committee, of which a Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) representative was also a member. He further claimed that far from removing any chapter on the Sikh Gurus, the Board, under his directives, had in fact incorporated chapters on the lives of the four Sahibzadas in the school text books to ensure that the youngsters also learn of their sacrifices, along with the history of the Sikh Gurus. He later pointed that the decision to realign the courses with NCERT syllabus was taken during the Akali regime in 2014. Taking the battle to the next level the Akalis have given an ultimatum to the government to immediately issue orders to stop 'the conspiracy to eliminate the proud and unparalleled history and heritage of the Khalsa Panth or face a worldwide popular resistance movement by the Sikh quom'. They along with their ally   (BJP) have decided to seek the Governor VP Singh Badnore's intervention in the matter. SAD President Sukhbir Singh Badal has convened an emergency meeting of the political affairs committee, the working committee, the general council, all the political advisers, all the zila and circle jathedars of the party Amritsar on May 11. To make matters worse, historians are also pointing at factual errors in the new books with regards to dates, references to historical figures and incorrect usage of words while referring to several aspects of Sikhism. Admitting to the mistakes, the government has apologised and promised to make necessary corrections after a review. Reports say that as many as 45,700 copies of the book have already been printed in Hindi, Punjabi and English mediums. Observers point out that this is the first issue on which a major confrontation between the Congress and Akalis appears imminent. Till now the Amarinder government has been facing flak for going soft on Akalis on various other issues. It is being questioned what was the need to change the syllabus knowing very well that this is a touchy issue. The additions were welcome but dilution of already existing content would obviously create unrest in a state like Punjab and that too in a syllabus of a subject like history for classes 11 and 12 where it is an optional subject and not a compulsory one. The government needs to tell who finalized the syllabus and when as the printing of books followed later. The issue is an emotive one that has fallen in the lap of the Akalis. It has all the potential to snowball into a major one at a time when Punjab prepares for the Shahkot Assembly by-poll scheduled for May 28 that will be followed by Lok Sabha polls in less than a year.",2018-05-04,, Punjab politics on the boil over 'dilution' of Sikh history in textbooks | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/culture-news/punjab-politics-on-the-boil-over-dilution-of-sikh-history-in-textbooks-111486.html

He must have given some injection that is why now Rahul Baba is daring to ask about four-and-half years of Modi government. “But the it’s the country which is seeking answers from you, four generations of Congress which ruled the country what have you done,” said Shah referring to Gandhi’s meet with Pawar after BJP’s loss in UP bypoll of Phulpur and Gorakhpur seats.  “When we lost the two Lok Sabha seats, Rahul Baba distributed sweets. But what about the  Congress, their candidates even forfeited their deposits. He is perhaps the only leader to distribute sweets when his party candidates forfeit deposits,” said Shah. Besides enumerating various welfare schemes, Shah raked up the Army’s surgical strikes across the LoC, to signify the Modi government’s achievements.  “During Congress rule, Pakistani terrorist would often kill our people and even beheaded our soldiers, but the government could do nothing. So when the Uri terror attack (2016) happened, Modi avenged it withing matter of days by sending soldiers across Pakistan for surgical strikes,” said Shah.  Reaching out to dalits, Shah asserted the BJP government will never abolish reservation system.    “They are now trying spread lies that the BJP diluted the SC/ST Act and claim we want to do away with the reservation system. BJP will never abolish reservation rather if the Congress tries to do that we will prevent them with all our might,” he said.  He also targeted the Congress over the disruption in Parliament that led to washout of a majority of the budget session. “Congress (leader) Ghulam Nabi Azad says that the government is afraid of facing questions in Parliament. We are not afraid, its them who did not allow parliament to function.  “We are ready for debate, why just Parliament, we are ready for debate on any platform. We are not afraid of debate because we have nothing to hide,” said Shah challenging Azad.  Continuing his attack Shah reminded Gandhi about BJP wresting power from it 11 states since 2014.  “We lost two seats, but want to tell Rahul that under Modi we snatched 11 governments from the Congress. From Maharashtra to Haryana from Jharkhand to Manipur, Assam and Uttarakhand, BJP is everywhere.  “Today 20 states and nearly 70% of the country’s population is ruled by BJP. But it is still not our golden period. BJP’s golden period will come when we will have governments in West Bengal and Odisha and retain power in 2019 with absolute majority,” said Shah exhorting partymen to prepare for the next Lok Sabha polls.

347,Ashwin Aghor,", a party that was always critical about dynasty, has just taken one more step towards it. Tejas Thackeray, younger son of party chief   has been projected on party hoardings put up after thumping victory by Yuva Sena in Mumbai University Senate elections. Yuva Sena is youth wing of Shiv Sena headed by Uddhav’s elder son Aditya. He was elevated as Shiv Sena leader in recently held national executive meeting of the party at Mumbai. Speculations are rife that Tejas will be handed over responsibility of Yuva Sena. It was strikingly highlighted in the hoardings put up by Yuva Sean after the victory in Mumbai University Senate elections. For the first time, Tejas featured on any political hoarding of Shiv Sena or Yuva Sena. It is a clear indication that Uddhav is promoting his younger son to take the charge of Yuva Sena. Unlike his father and elder brother, Tejas had been low profile. He came into limelight for the first time when Tejas discovered five species of fresh water crabs in February last year and one of them was named after him.  Being in oblivion since then, Tejas suddenly hit the limelight when his photo appeared on party hoarding recently. Shiv Sena Secretary Milind Narvekar put Tejas’ photo on the advertisement published in party mouthpiece Saamna, congratulating Yuva Sean for the victory in Mumbai University Senate elections.  “It is the beginning of branding Tejas as politician who in all probabilities will soon be heading Yuva Sena. The post will be vacated once Aditya completely shifts to Shiv Sena,” said a senior Shiv Sena leader who did not wish to be named.  Shiv Sena Spokesperson Manisha Kayande said, “Tejas is a keen environmentalist and social activist. Party cadre will definitely welcome the decision if the leadership decides to induct him in the Yuva Sena.” The youth wing of Shiv Sena, won all the 10 seats to Mumbai University Senate under the leadership of Aditya Thackeray recently. This thumping victory and Aditya’s elevation to Shiv Sena was the right time to induct Tejas in the politics, feels another senior party leader.  “Once Aditya was elevated to Shiv Sena as leader, it was obvious that he would gradually withdraw from the day to day affairs of Yuva Sena. And in that situation, Tejas can step in elder brother’s shoes and take over the youth wing,” the leader said. Once Tejas takes over Yuva Sena, Aditya will concentrate on forthcoming state Assembly and Lok Sabha elections with his father. “The victory in the Mumbai University Senate elections is the concrete evidence that people have complete faith in Shiv Sena and its ideology. This victory is result of the social service we have been doing over the last eight years. “Similar activities are being carried out by Shiv Sena. It will help us in forthcoming state Assembly and Lok Sabha elections as well,” said Aditya Thackeray. After elevation to Shiv Sena as one of the eight first line leaders, Aditya will now focus on the affairs of Shiv Sena. “In fact, his progression to Shiv Sena bagan in 2014 when he was part of the team that discussed seat sharing with BJP,” said a Shiv Sena leader. While Shiv Sena leaders are enthusiastic about the development, the other parties such as   (BJP) and Congress apparently have decided not to comment on it, saying it was the internal matter of Shiv Sena.",2018-04-06,, Is Shiv Sena staring at Dynasty 2.0? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/is-shiv-sena-staring-at-dynasty-2-0-106642.html

Binoy Tamang, GJMM leader said “We have decided to go for an electoral alliance with the Trinamool Congress in the Dooars region in the upcoming Panchayat elections. We will support the AITC in those GP, Panchyat Samiti and Zilla Parishad where they have put up candidates. In some areas where AITC cannot provide candidates, GJMM candidates will fight as independent candidates and will support AITC.” According to GJMM spokesperson  , this has been done to restore peace in the Darjeeling hills. He said that they support the government's initiative to usher in development and restore peace in the hills. Sources in the GJMM said that a four-member team will be visiting Dooars next week and speak to the AITC. The Kamtapur Progressive Party and Adivasi Vikash Parishad have also given a call to support AITC in the Dooars region in the upcoming Panchayat election. Sourav Chakraborty, AITC's Zilla Sabhapati at Jalpiaguri, said “ We have spoken with GJMM in this regard and we have come to an electoral understanding. However, the final discussions will take place next week. It was decided that wherever we are unable to put up a candidate, GJMM will field candidates. They can fight as independents and support us.” According to Chakraborty, there are various Gorkha communities staying in the Dooars region and if an electoral alliance is formed with GJMM, it will benefit the AITC. The GJMM has got a strong foothold in the tea gardens of Bagrakot, Madarihat, Birpara, Jaigaon, Kalchini and Chamurchi. In the last Panchayat elections, GJMM backed nominees had won from these seats.

349,Rajeev Khanna,"Debt waiver to farmers remains at the centre-stage of Punjab of politics and it will continue to be so at least till the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The reason is that it was the Congress-led government under Captain Amarinder Singh that set the ball rolling last year by announcing a 'partial waiver' and the Congress will try to cash maximum on this. The announcements on the waivers by the   (BJP) chief ministers in the other states came much level. Despite the criticism on the various aspects of the waiver in Punjab, Amarinder appears to be determined not to let go of the political advantage achieved till now. In fact taking it to the next level, he has now announced that his government would soon begin the waiving off farm debts from commercial banks, which would be completed by the end of the year. Till now the loans being waived off were those extended by co-operative banks. Experts on agricultural economics point out that the government will have to think of a long term solution on the issue of farm distress and farmer suicides as on time waiver is no guarantee that the debt will not be accumulated by the farmers again or it will put an end to the suicides. In addition to this, the waiver on loans from the commercial banks will add to the debt of the state government. The waivers can be seen as an instant measure to extinguish the fire but fire prevention measures need to be put in place for the future. Whether any political party has a blueprint for this is the main question facing Punjab at this point of time. On Thursday, Amarinder handed over debt relief certificates worth Rs.156.12 crore to 26,998 farmers from six districts of the state. He also announced a financial assistance of Rs. 50,000 each to the landless labourers to bail them out of the current agrarian crisis. In a token gesture, he handed over debt waiver certificates to six farmers one from each of the six districts of Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Nawanshahr and Hoshiarpur and said that so far debt relief to the tune of Rs. 457 crore had been disbursed to nearly 1.02 lakh farmers in three different phases covering 16 districts. He said that after completing the debt relief scheme of co-operative loans, the state government would soon begin the waiving off farm debts from commercial banks. He pointed that despite the massive financial crisis facing the state his government is giving the maximum financial assistance to the farmers in terms of debt waiver relief up to Rs.2 lakh. He claimed this is the highest in the country while pointing out that in case of Uttar Pradesh it is Rs.1 lakh, while Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are waiving off only Rs 50,000 each. But the Opposition has been attacking Amarinder for not waiving off the entire loan of the farmers, a promise the Congress party had made in the run up to the polls. The attacks on Amarinder also indicate that the Opposition would not allow the Congress to walk away with electoral benefits on the issue. There has also been criticism of the government organizing elaborate functions to hand over the certificates of loan waivers to farmers which many feel amounts to public humiliation of the poor farmers. Aam Aadmi Party ( ) leader and Sukhpal Singh Khaira who is also the leader of Opposition has castigated Amarinder for indulging in 'cheap political gimmickry' by holding functions to glorify absolutely 'meager, laughable and non productive debt waiver' being given to the aggrieved farmers. He said that this smacks of cheapness by a feudal, besides rubbing salt on the wounds of debt ridden farmers. Khaira said that instead of apologizing to the farmers for promising to write off their entire loan, be it banks or commission agents, Amarinder is on the contrary exploiting their indebtedness by holding these functions to distribute meager debt waiver. He stated that Amarinder has till now waived off a total of Rs. 485 crore worth debt including the Rs. 156.12 crore waived off at Gurdaspur which is not even half a percent of the colossal debt of Rs. 1 lakh crore. He pointed that 390 farmers and farm labourers have committed suicide during the Congress regime. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) too has attacked Amarinder saying that it is a shame that the Congress government is insulting farmers in the name of a loan waiver when nothing is being done for them or farm labourers even as farm suicides are on the rise with almost 400 farmers committing suicide in the last one year. Senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia said it is shocking that the Congress government is using popular singers and an advertising blitzkrieg to be-fool Punjabis into thinking that a farm loan waiver is taking place in Punjab. “The truth is that the Congress government has failed to implement the promised Rs 90,000 crore farmer loans taken from nationalized and cooperative banks as well as private money lenders,” he said. He said the SAD on its part would continue to fight for the cause of complete waiver of loans of farmers and farm labourers and would shortly announce an agitation plan for the same. While the parties slug it out on the farm waiver on the political turf. Agriculture economy experts point out that the waiver would be futile in the face of the absence of a long term strategy to tackle agrarian crisis. They said that if the government goes ahead with a waiver on loans taken from commercial banks, it would amount to a debt burden of another Rs 70,000 crore on the state. The state will have to borrow this money to execute this. “One time waiver is no guarantee that the farmers will not accumulate debt again or suicides will stop. The state will have to go in for diversifying the rural economy in Punjab. It will have to go in for value addition through agriculture processing. Emphasis has to be on skill development in the rural areas besides focusing on rural health. There has to be stress on making rural population employable and creating employability in the rural areas,” points out eminent agriculture economist Professor Ranjit Singh Ghuman who heads the Nehru SAIL chair at Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development in Chandigarh. He underlined that unbridled populism neither amounts to good economics nor good politics. But for now, long term goals can wait. The politicians are more focused on short term electoral gains. One this is for sure that after the recent farmers' march in Maharashtra and a series of farmer agitations in states like Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and just a couple of days back in Himachal Pradesh, agrarian distress will be one of the core issues in the 2019 polls and every party will try to exploit it for its electoral gains.",2018-04-06,, Farm loan waiver: Has Captain done enough to ease agrarian distress and prevent farmer suicides? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/farm-loan-waiver-has-captain-done-enough-to-ease-agrarian-distress-and-prevent-farmer-suicides-106646.html
350,Charu Kartikeya,"Several ills do plague the online media sector and therefore efforts to address them are welcome, but the way the Modi government has initiated the process is problematic. This government's record of a propagandist and an autocratic approach to media has further complicated the situation. The most glaring gap in the constitution of this new committee is that it does not include any representative from the very sector it seeks to study. There are at least a dozen respectable players in the online news segment alone, but neither the editors nor proprietors nor any representative from these organisations are a part of this committee. How does the government propose to come up with regulations for the sector without involving the people who know it first hand? Efforts to seek the ministry's response on this question were unsuccessful. Catch reached out to Amit Katoch, Director of the ministry's New Media Cell, via email but he did not reply. Siddharth Varadarajan, one of the founding editors of website The Wire, has come out with scathing comments against the move. “The fact that @smritiirani and @narendramodi have excluded digital media representatives from the committee tasked with formulating rules and regulations for news websites speaks volumes for their real intentions, Varadarajan said in a series of tweets. He also stressed that the argument that news websites are 'unregulated' is incorrect because the IT Act “is a major form of regulation”, apart from “all provisions of IPC, tax laws”.   Senior journalist Vikram Chandra also agreed with the contention that such an effort was meaningless without representatives from the online sector.     Interestingly, in 2016, the union government had initiated a process to frame guidelines for PIB accreditation for online journalists. Editors of several web-based organisations had also been invited to give their inputs. This process was much more open that the latest one announced by the I&B Ministry. However, no one knows what was the result of that first round of consultations for accreditation. Accreditation for online journalists is yet to take off and the editors never heard from the PIB again.     The record of this government, its ministers and large number of names associated with the ruling party does not inspire any confidence in their ability to effectively regulate the online ecosystem in a way that will not hamper its functioning. Recently, as many as 13 ministers of the Modi-government were found pushing dubious content published by an equally dubious website.   BJP leaders, including ministers, have been found guilty of pushing similar content, essentially propaganda, on many occasions earlier. Several such websites keep publishing pro-BJP and anti-Opposition content and BJP leaders push them on social media. This has led many to argue that if the BJP indeed wants to ensure that content on the web is factual and devoid of propaganda, it will have to first set its own house in order.       Until the BJP shows willingness to stop these propaganda wars on the internet, its efforts to regulate media will always be looked at with suspicion.  It appears the super-busy Information and Broadcasting Ministry is working on multiple fronts simultaneously to take the   government's media strategy to the next level. After the controversy over the government's misguided attempt to regulate fake news, it has now been reported that the I&B Ministry has initiated efforts to regulate online media. A committee has reportedly been set up under the new media cell of the ministry to deliberate and come up with a “regulatory framework for online media/news portals including digital broadcasting and entertainment/infotainment sites & news/media aggregators”. An order issued by the ministry, dated 4 April, says the terms of reference of the committee include - to delineate the sphere of online information which needs to be brought under regulation to recommend appropriate policy formulation, keeping in mind FDI norms, programme & advertising code for TV channels, norms circulated by the Press Council of India, code of ethics framed by the National Broadcasters Association and norms prescribed by the Indian Broadcasting Foundation to adopt best practices from similar mechanisms globally.  ",2018-04-06,," Dear Smriti Irani, why is nobody from online media on your panel to regulate it? | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/dear-smriti-irani-why-is-nobody-from-online-media-on-your-panel-to-regulate-it-106649.html
351,Neeraj Thakur,"Hinduism has been debated over and defined innumerable times by an array of theologians, sages, kings and philosophers. Going by the records of interpretations of Hinduism, it would be difficult to point out one particular way or ritual that could be defined as peculiarly Hindu. From the Vedas, to the Upanishads and the Puranas, one finds a number of different, often contradictory versions on the Hindu philosophy and rituals attached to it. In this context, the title of Shashi Tharoor’s new volume ‘Why I am a Hindu', makes it clear that the politician-author is staying away from prescribing his Hinduism to others. He is putting out his understanding of the religion that he was born in and in the process raises questions for his readers to ponder before blindly subscribing to any interpretation of this millennia-old religion.  The idea of political Hinduism was first introduced by Mahatma Gandhi during India’s freedom movement against the British. It is believed that without Gandhi’s call for a Ram Rajya – essentially a Hindu theocratic state – it would not have been possible for   to become a party of the masses. However, soon after Gandhi fired the imaginations of the masses with his idea of a Ram Rajya, a section of Hindu hardliners (including Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh or RSS) emerged. Over the years, it redefined the meaning of Ram Rajya – focusing on aggressive analogies from the religious traditions of Hinduism in an attempt to give a monotheistic face to a religion that had evolved in a polytheistic manner.  This changed Hinduism is fast becoming popular and has given a clear majority to a non-Congress party only the second time since Independence. Given the role that religion has played in Indian politics, since the days of freedom struggle, Tharoor’s theological polemic is an attempt at reclaiming the fast fading idea of Hinduism that helped Gandhi to move the masses- from the RSS version of it under the nomenclature of Hindutva (a term coined by BJP’s icon, VD Savarkar). Tharoor is a prolific writer with close to two dozen titles to his name that deal with varied subjects ranging from politics, history, sociology, culture and religion. This kind of scholarship, takes Tharoor closer to the legacy of none other than Jawaharlal Nehru, who in his book, ‘Discovery Of India’ also made an attempt to explain Hindu traditions and its ever evolving nature to accommodate newer streams of philosophy that emerged with the passage of time. Nehru talked about the reasons behind the fall of Indian Civilization that surrendered to the British. Tharoor, in his thesis on Hinduism, is drawing attention to the immediate danger that looms over this age-old civilisation due to the emergence of an exclusivist interpretation of an inclusive way of life. Tharoor, quotes with ease chronologically from Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, epics to put forth an idea that while each of the sacred texts that are part of Hinduism are important none of them can claim to be superior to the other: “ Hinduism has not one sacred book, but several, both complementary and contradictory to each other. The Hindu scriptures are commonly divided into Srutis, Smritis, Itihasas, Puranas, Agamas and Darshanas.” Since Tharoor is countering RSS/BJP-supported Hindutva, which has entered the kitchens of people enforcing upon them the eating habits of North Indian Brahmins, he quotes the tradition of ‘animal sacrifices’, in the Rig Veda, “including those of cattle.” Giving vivid description of the six Indian philosophical schools of thought, Tharoor, argues that Hinduism has the tradition of even accepting atheism – unlike Abrahmic religions – therefore any attempt to limit it to a particular ritual or any one religious book would be against the essence of the tradition of the Indian civilisation that has travelled a long way from the days of Indus Valley Civilisation. While the BJP, as a part of its project to consolidate the Hindu philosophy has tried to selectively appropriate certain Hindu philosophers, Tharoor, cleverly, for his readers brings alive many more souls who have contributed to the tradition of this religion. Tharoor does not stop there, he pitches the philosophy of Vivekananda against that of Golwalkar. Quoting Swami Vivekananda’s speech to the Chicago convention in which he defended the idea of freedom to choose one’s way of worshiping God, Tharoor builds a narrative against the later Hindutva ideologues who the BJP takes inspiration from. “Unity in variety is the plan of nature, and the Hindu has recognized it. Every other religion lays down certain fixed dogmas and tries to compel the society to adopt them. It places before society only one coat which must fit Jack and John and Henry, all alike. If it does not fit John or Henry, he must go without Coat to cover his body. The Hindus have discovered that the absolute can only be realized or thought of or stated through the relative and the images, crosses and crescents are simply so many symbols – so many pegs to hang spiritual ideas on. It is not that this help is necessary for everyone, but those that do not need it have no right to say that it is wrong. Nor is it compulsory in Hinduism.” Compare the above mentioned idea of Vivekananda with the following one put forth by M.S Golwalkar- the second Sarsanghchalak of the RSS in his treatise ‘ We, or our Nationahood defined’: “To keep up the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her purging the country of the Semitic Races – the Jews. Race pride at its highest has been manifested here. Germany has also shown how well nigh impossible it is for Races and cultures, having differences going to the root, to be assimilated into one united Whole, a good lesson for us In Hindustan to learn and profit by.” Tharoor, by drawing comparison between two different streams of thoughts on the idea of India, nature and its culture, leaves it to his readers to take a call on what type of Hinduism would they want to espouse – Vivekanada’s or Golwalkar’s ? Tharoor has not kept his book limited to dealing with only the ancient values of Hinduism. The second part of his book defines the limits and possibilities of a modern India. He talks about hunger, poverty, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and secularism. It is an attempt by Tharoor to prescribe the assimilation of newer democratic values in this age old religion. By doing so, he widens the scope of his book from being concerned with only theological pursuits, to something that concerns sociology and constitutional debates as well. The battle between Hindusim and Hindutva is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, more so because the propounders of the latter after a struggle of close to 100 years have built their stronghold among a sizeable chunk of the country’s population. But such books are not written for immediate results. It is aimed at taking on the idea of exclusivist identity of Hinduism- something that takes selectively from the past to serve the political purposes of the present.  Why I am a Hindu is an important addition in the tradition of intra-religion theological debate. How these ideas percolate down among followers of Hinduism will decide the future course of India's politics.",2018-04-07,, Why I am a Hindu book review: Shashi Tharoor takes on political Hindutva with his personal Hinduism | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/culture-news/book-review-why-i-am-a-hindu-shashi-tharoor-takes-on-political-hindutva-with-his-personal-hindusim-106801.html
352,Charu Kartikeya,"The wind vane of Indian politics has spoken. Less than a month after   BJP leaders to be “more tactful and avoid blunders”, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has now cautioned that Dalit anger could erupt like a volcano. The Lok Janshakti Party chief, currently serving his ninth term as MP and seventh stint as Union Minister, is among the country's most well-known Dalit leaders. Against the background of ongoing protests by Dalits, Paswan has admitted in an   that the BJP has a perception problem among Dalits. Not just that, he has warned that Dalit anger will erupt like a volcano if it is suppressed. “There is lava inside — when it comes out slowly, the volcano doesn’t erupt; but if you suppress it, then it becomes an active volcano,” Paswan said, in his sharpest comments on the condition of Dalits under the  -government so far. It must be noted that Paswan had studiously avoided any critical analysis of the Modi government throughout the last four years. It appears that rising anger and aggression among Dalits across the country has finally forced him to come out of his comfort zone and challenge his own government, led by the BJP. Various Dalit organisations had called for a nationwide shutdown on 2 April, in protest against the government's failure to file a review petition in the Supreme Court. The agitators wanted the government to oppose the apex court's alleged dilution of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The shutdown was largely successful in many parts of the country and left the government visibly shaken. Several Dalit MPs of the BJP have spoken out against the plight of Dalits across the country and have warned of agitations if their concerns were not immediately addressed. Modi and other BJP leaders, while blaming Opposition parties for the agitation, appear to have felt the heat. The PM has instructed BJP MPs to spend at least two nights in Dalit-dominated villages in a bid to “restore” the faith of the community in their party. Paswan's statement at such a time has come as a veiled indicator of a concern among NDA parties that the Dalit vote might indeed be shifting away from the BJP and, by extension, the NDA. For BJP, Paswan has suggested the way out of this mess but his prescription is nothing short of reaching for the moon. The steps outlined by him include creating model villages for Dalits, reservations in the private sector, reservations in promotion, land to landless Dalits and creating an all-India service for better representation of Dalits in the judiciary (https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-image-among-dalits-needs-to-change-ram-vilas-paswan/story-8SoPRG1gXxnWW4lbyghGKK.html). All of these are hotly-contested propositions and have been put on the back-burner by successive dispensations for past several years. The Modi government too is yet to signal any movement towards these steps. So, Paswan's warning, in a nutshell, is that the BJP has all but lost the Dalit vote. However, Paswan's assessment of the scenario presently unfolding in the country has deeper portents. Frustrated by decades of exploitation and violence at the hands of upper-castes, Dalits appear to be increasing refusing to cow down anymore. They are not only asserting their rights, but are also agitating, forming armies and organising shutdowns. They seem to be indicating that they have had enough of tokenism and now they want real steps that will lead to a change in their fortunes. Through his lava metaphor, Paswan is warning of a larger social crisis and not merely an electoral one. If BJP chooses to ignore him now, the party will do so at its own peril.",2018-04-09,, Paswan's clear message to Modi: BJP has all but lost the Dalit vote | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/paswan-s-clear-message-to-modi-bjp-has-all-but-lost-the-dalit-vote-107088.html
353,Sulagna Sengupta,"The tussle between Opposition and the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) in the West Bengal Panchayat elections is continuing. The Opposition parties claim that they were unable to file nominations in around 80% places due to threats by the ruling party. Adding to the their agony was the West Bengal State Election Commission's decision to withdraw its earlier notification extending the last date for filing nominations from 9 April to 3 PM on 10 April. The new order mentioned said “It appears that there was no specific direction by the Supreme Court of India for extension of the nomination date. Therefore, on perusal of all the papers and considering all the points, the Commission hereby recalls the said order and therefore rescinds the (previous) order.” The decision created huge resentment among the Opposition parties. On Tuesday, various Opposition parties staged a demonstration outside the SEC office. The BJP has threatened to approach the courts again. The High Court will be hearing the matter on Thursday. Meanwhile, the CPI(M) has called for a state-wide bandh on Friday, 13 April. According to the BJP, it could not file nominations in around 26,000 seats out of 48,650. Out of a total number of 9,217 seats in Panchayat Samiti, they could file nominations around 4,500 seats and out of a total of 825 seats in Zilla Parishad, they could file nominations in around 550 seats. Sources in the state BJP said that the worst affected districts include Birbhum, Bankura, Burdwam, South 24 Parganas and parts of North 24 Pargana and Murshidabad . According to CPI(M) leaders, the party could not file nominations around 40,000 GP seats, 7,000 seats in for the Panchyat Samiti and 300 seats for the Zilla Parishad. According to the figures collected from the state BJP office, in Birbhum the party was able to file nominations in 3,000 GP seats, while at the Panchyat Samiti they could field candidates in 450 seats. The party was only able to field a candidate in one ZP seat. In Burdwan BJP could file nominations at 3,000 Gram Panchyat seats, 300 seats Panchyat Samiti seats and 20 seats in the Zilla Parishad. In Bankura BJP could file nominations at 2,000 Gram Panchayat seats, 250 Panchayat Samiti seats and 22 seats for the Zilla Parishad. In South 24 Parganas, BJP could file nominations 2,000 Gram Panchayat seats, 200 Panchayat Samiti seats and 15 Zilla Parishad seats. In Murshidabad, BJP could file nominations in 3,000 Gram Panchyat seats , 350 Panchyat Samiti seats and 30 Zilla Parishad seats. According to state BJP president Dilip Ghosh “This is simply grabbing of power. We have already informed to the State Election Commission that our party workers were unable to file their nominations. Even on Monday our workers were beaten up in many places when they went to file their nominations even at the SDO office. After receiving the Supreme Court judgment , we went to the Election Commission and urged it to provide proper security coverage for filing of nominations”. In response to a petition by the BJP, the Supreme Court had refused to intervene in the poll process and instructed the party to approach the state election commission. According to CPI(M) leaders, the party workers were unable to file their nominations even on the last day for the process. A four-member team led by CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty met State Election Commissioner Amarendra Singh and handed over the nomination papers of those candidates who could not file nominations. CPI(M) leader Robin Deb said “ There is total anarchy in West Bengal . The ruling party is trying to grab power without elections. It won’t last long. We met with the State Election Commissioner on Monday as well and urged him to take proper steps so that candidates could file their nominations. We are ready to fight in 100% seats”. Adhir Chowdhury, West Bengal Congress chief, said ""I went to the High Court on Monday and appealed it to take steps so that we could file nominations peacefully. We are unable to file nominations in majority of the districts except a few seats in Malda and Murshidabad."" In his petition, Chowdhury claimed that the ruling AITC workers are perpetrating violence in the state to terrorise Opposition candidates. He appealed for the deployment of central forces to ensure security of voters as well as candidates during the panchayat elections. The ruling AITC, however, has accused the Opposition of trying to discredit the state government. According to state parliamentary affairs minister, Partha Chatterjee, “ It's the Opposition's failure that they could not file their nominations.

354,Rajeev Khanna,"It is a sordid tale of intrigues and deception that is unraveling in Punjab as dirt stumbles out of the government's closet. At the helm of all this are top police officers, bureaucrats and politicians. The man who stands cornered is none other the Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh who is responsible for the developments as he also holds the home portfolio in the state. It all began on Friday when one of the Director Generals of Police (DGP) Siddharth Chattopadhyay in a plea before the Punjab and Haryana High Court blamed DGP Suresh Arora, DGP Dinkar Gupta and Inspector General (IG) LK Yadav for dragging his name in a high-profile suicide case. According to media reports, Chattopadhyay suggested that the role of top two DGPs, including the state police chief, came to light in a drug case probe. He also pointed at a benami property acquired by a DGP. These allegations brought out the cold war that has been going on in the top echelons of the state police. Sources say that there has been a considerable heartburn over Amarinder deciding to continue with Arora as the police chief as the latter had been promoted to the top slot by the former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) –   (BJP) dispensation and it was being assumed that someone else would replace him with political change of guard after the Punjab Assembly polls. But along with the details about the cold war, came a bagful of embarrassment for Amarinder who immediately swung into damage control mode saying he would not tolerate any indiscipline in the force. He discussed the issue with Home Secretary NS Kalsi, DGP Suresh Arora and his Chief Principal Secretary Suresh Kumar directing them to examine the matter and suggest suitable action. According to a government spokesperson, Amarinder was of the view that any grievance by any member of the police force, including those against colleagues, should be routed through the well-established administrative procedures and channels laid down for the purpose. There are well laid down hierarchies that need to be stringently adhered to, if the police force is to function efficaciously. He said that as a former member of a uniformed force, he is of the opinion that any act of indiscipline is a matter of grave concern, to be treated with seriousness. The 80,000 strong Punjab Police force naturally looks up to its senior officers for leadership and direction and internal discord or friction can seriously undermine its professional and operational capabilities. Amarinder pointed that the Punjab Police that had bravely fought militancy in the state in the 1980s and 90s is required to be both professional and transparent in its functioning in order to effectively deal with the various challenges on the crime along with law and order front. He said that police personnel, especially senior officers, are in the public eye at all times and need to exercise due caution in their personal and professional conduct. He made it clear that he would not hesitate to take stern action, if needed, to check indiscipline. Amarinder has directed the Kalsi and Suresh Arora to ensure that all investigations in the drugs cases are carried out impartially, without fear or favour. He asserted that his government is committed not only to the elimination of drugs but also to stringent punishment, under the law, to those responsible for destroying the state’s future generation with this menace. Such a stance was fine till it was confined to the police department and the administration. What came out alongside is all set to have a damning impact on the politics and it remains to be seen what course Amarinder takes. Sunday morning saw a report in a leading English daily saying that a report filed by the Special Task Force (STF) created by Amarinder after assuming office last year says that senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia 'had a role in facilitating supply of a drug pseudoephedrine to two Canadian NRIs in the infamous Jagdish Bhola scandal of 2013'. Pseudoephedrine is reportedly used to manufacture the pharmaceutical drug 'Chitta' that has caused havoc in Punjab over the last more than one decade. The document filed by the STF chief Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) Harpreet Sidhu before the Punjab and Haryana High Court reportedly says that there is prima facie sufficient evidence on record to further investigate the role of Majithia regarding various allegations. Here begins the political tangle. Majithia is the brother of Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal who is the wife of SAD president Sukhbir Badal. Majithia is the leader to whom Aam Aadmi Party's ( ) national convener and Delhi Chief Minister   had apologised last month for leveling allegations of his involvement in the drug trade in Punjab. He had drawn flak from his party men in Punjab as the drug issue had been at the core of AAP's campaign for the Punjab assembly elections. Interestingly, senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh who is also facing a defamation case filed by Majithia for the same charges has not taken his words back. But more important had been the statement coming from Amarinder's Cabinet colleague   who had also said that the STF had enough evidence against Majithia and had sought the latter's arrest. He had read out the report findings in a media briefing. Majithia at that point had held Sidhu responsible for contempt of court. With the latest reports coming out, he has reportedly said that he and Harpreet Sidhu are estranged cousins who are not on good terms. He has said that he would reveal everything about the issue soon. Just a couple of months back, former Punjab Congress chief and sitting Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa who is known to be Amarinder's arch rival, had also flagged the issue in an interview. Replying to a question on Amarinder going soft on Akalis, he had reportedly said, “He talks of ‘no vendetta’. We are talking of justice to the people of Punjab. Those who looted Punjab for 10 years have to be made accountable for acts of omission and commission. Bikram Majithia should have been booked a long time back.” Over the last two days the AAP's Leader of the Opposition Sukhpal Khaira has been gunning for Amarinder writing one tweet after the other reminding him of the tall claims that he had made in the run up to the Punjab polls. AAP has always accused of the Congress and the SAD-BJP combine playing a friendly match thus cheating the people of the state. He has also been challenging the Badals to clarify their stand on the issue. Observers say that it is just a matter of time that voices will be raised from within the Congress too seeking action from Amarinder. Interestingly, he has maintained a stoic silence on Majithia over the last two days. A large number of observers feel that Amarinder has spent one year dilly-dallying on different issues but he will have to come up with something concrete that is visible ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls if the Congress wants to make gains not only in Punjab but in the adjoining states of Himachal Pradesh and Haryana as well that are also feeling the heat of pharmaceutical drug menace. Till that happens, the popularity of the party is all set to erode in Punjab.",2018-04-09,,  Amarinder and top cops cornered as drug dirt against Majithia tumbles out of the closet | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/amarinder-and-top-cops-cornered-as-drug-dirt-against-majithia-tumbles-out-of-the-closet-107096.html
355,Neeraj Thakur,"Despite its claim of being pro-poor and pro-Dalits, the BJP seems to have systematically undermined the rights of the Dalit communities in India. on April 4, a group of MPs accused the government of having blocked post-matric scholarships (PMS) for students belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, worth Rs 12,000 crore. In a letter written to Finance Minister  , three Communist Party of India (Marxist) MPs – P.K. Biju, Jitendra Choudhury and Mohammed Salim and one Indian National Lok Dal MP, Charanjit Singh Rori, wrote that scholarship funds for around 56 lakh SC/ST students have are facing delays. This amount is reimbursed by the social justice and empowerment ministry, which is the nodal ministry for the welfare of SCs. It is important to note that their upper caste groups have recently stirred up online and offline campaigning against reservations for SCs in education and jobs accusing the system of “killing merit”. But the failure of the BJP government to support meritorious students from SC/ST communities at school level tells a different story altogether. “I don't understand what the government is doing. Nirav Modi alone siphoned off Rs 12,000 crore in the (PNB bank) scam. And the government is saying they do not have money for students,” said Kancha Illaiah Shepherd, Dalit intellectual and activist. “In the absence of funds, a large number of students will drop out from schools,” adds Shepherd. The impact of delay in releasing the post-metric scholarship funds for SC/STs has affected universities and higher education institutes as well. Tata Institute of Social Sciences was forced to withdraw fee exemption given to SC, ST and OBC students (including religious minorities) who were eligible to the Government of India Post-Matric Scholarship. In February this year, students from the affected community went on strike against the administration, which in return blamed the central government for not giving funds. Then, smartly, in the name of giving more autonomy to graded universities, the government cleared the decks for withdrawal of subsidies to universities by asking them to generate their own funds. This move is set to force universities to increase the fee structure of courses. This move is also likely to affect the SC/ST/OBC students the most, as the number of economically backward students in large in these communities. But these are just economic setbacks that Dalits have received under the BJP government. According to  , a crime is committed against Dalits every 15 minutes in India. And six Dalit women are raped every day, according to official statistics that register a 66% hike in atrocities in the past ten years 2007-2017.” But under the BJP government since 2014, there has been a major spike in crimes against Dalits- especially by cow vigilantes in and around Dalit villages. The attack on Dalits for skinning dead cows in Una made headlines. It is not a surprise that a young Dalit leader Jignesh Mewani, who led the protests after the UNA violence against Dalits went on to become a member of legislative assembly in Gujarat in 2017. It is an irony that despite increasing violence against Dalits, the Supreme Court of India decided to amend the SC/ST act, which dilutes the provisions of the law that ensures immediate arrest of those perpetrating crimes against the oppressed castes in the country. The decision of the SC has led to mass protests all over the country forcing even BJP Dalit leaders to speak against the government. BJP president   has told his MPs and MLAs to go and eat with Dalits and celebrate the birth anniversaries of different Dalit icons. But unless his party stops the right-wing Upper Caste forces that see Dalits as lesser mortals meant to be suppressed, it is not going to be possible for the BJP to repeat 2014 kind of electoral performance in the country. Therefore, the focus of the BJP should be to protect the rights of Dalits and not indulge in empty symbolism.In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP is said to have won over a substantial chunk of Dalit voters, who had earlier been voting for the Bahujan Samaj Party or the Congress. This was partly due to the party's success in winning over important Dalit leaders like Ram Vilas Paswan, Ramdas Athawale and Udit Raj. Now there are rumblings against the BJP within the Dalit community. Even two of these three leaders – Paswan and Udit Raj – have criticised the BJP in the recent past over its treatment of Dalits. Another Dalit ally, Jitan Ram Manjhi, has snapped his alliance with the BJP. The 2 April Bharat Bandh is said to have been the culmination of Dalit anger against the BJP. While the trigger was the Supreme Court's dilution of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the anger was also against the BJP broader apathy towards Dalits. The question that needs to be examined is what has the   government done for Dalits in the past four years?",2018-04-11,," Dear Amit Shah, safeguard Dalits' rights instead of indulging in empty symbolism | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/dear-amit-shah-safeguard-dalits-rights-instead-of-indulging-in-empty-symbolism-107440.html
356,Rajeev Khanna,"Having dithered from contesting the Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections last year, the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) is moving towards contesting the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in Haryana as a serious contender. The Lok Sabha polls are scheduled one year down the line and the Haryana assembly polls would follow in a few months after that. The party is putting its organisational structure in place besides chalking out a series of programmes that are to be undertaken in the months to come. Its national convener and Delhi Chief Minister   had addressed a well-attended rally in Hisar last month that was followed by a successful roadshow in Rohtak-Bhiwani areas of the state. Taking the momentum forward, the emphasis is now being put on strengthening the organisation at the booth level. It has been decided that Kejriwal himself would hold meetings after April 15 with booth level workers in different constituencies of the state. The decision was taken at a meeting held in Delhi some days back at Kejriwal's residence in the presence of party's Haryana in-charge Gopal Rai and state unit chief Naveen Jaihind. AAP has already announced that it will be contesting both the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the state. According to Jaihind, teams have been constituted by the party to zero in on the potential candidates for the elections. AAP has made the right move by taking the decision to contest the polls as Haryana provides a fertile ground for the party to expand its base outside Delhi and Punjab. To begin with the party can exploit the spill over effect of its governance in Delhi in areas that fall in the national capital region (NCR). It can play up what it has delivered in Delhi to the people in these areas. With a large number of its leaders in Delhi, including Kejriwal, having ancestral connect with Haryana, they can easily reach out to the people with emotive appeals. But the most important is the opportunity that is available in the Jat heartland. AAP's leadership appears to understand this very well and this is why Kejriwal's rally and the subsequent road show were held in the Jat heartland. Observers say that after the Jat reservation agitation of 2016 and the subsequent developments, particularly the isolation of Jat community, the Jats are expected to vote one-sided this time. With almost one fourth of the vote share the community is just sitting on the fence observing the developments in the different parties. With the Congress dilly-dallying on handing over the reins of the party to its most powerful Jat leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda with a pan Haryana presence, the situation remains fertile. The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), the other party having Jat support has also been out of power for more than a decade. With the Jats unlikely to go with the   (BJP), there is a window of opportunity available for AAP to make its presence in the Jat community. However, AAP isn't just targetting the Jat vote. It is also looking at wooing Bania voters who have tradionally been supporters of the BJP. Both Kejriwal and Jaihind happen to be Banias. Even in Delhi, the party has tried hard to woo BJP's trader vote bank, by raising issues like sealing by MCD and the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax Leaving asides the politics of wooing various communities, Haryana today is offering a number of issues to the political parties to lap up. These issues include farm distress, unemployment and employment scams coming to light, women safety and security, the skewed sex ratio, the menace of cow vigilantes, targeting of minorities, atrocities on Dalits, the high number of rapes etc. These are issues that will form the narrative of both the forthcoming Lok Sabha and assembly polls in the state. There is a strong view that under the BJP regime led by Manohar Lal Khattar, the state is fast turning into another laboratory of Hindutva after Gujarat. While Khattar and his party will try to hard sell their achievements on the 'development' plank, the fact remains that the government has unraveled whenever there has been trouble at hand, be it the violence at the Dera of godman Ram Pal, the violence during the Jat agitation or the mayhem by followers of Baba Ram Rahim in Panchkula. AAP has started attacking the state government with Jaihind issuing a statement recently saying that Khattar regime is behaving like a big trader in the job market. He said that AAP had flagged the recent job scam that has been making headlines in the state two years ago. It was on April 5 that Khattar's Flying Squad had busted a gang of employees of Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) and other departments along with their brokers running a job-for-cash racket. They would take money from aspirants for getting them selected for government jobs. Jaihind has accused the government of doing nothing over the last two years and now taking credit by making a few clerks as scape goats. Jaihind has leveled a series of allegations against the BJP regime saying that those people have been made members of HSSC to recruit school lecturers and taxation inspectors who are themselves incapable of becoming clerks. He has said that people have been misled about the selection criteria in context of evaluation of interviews and written exams. He has also raised the demand that is being aired by other Opposition parties with regards to the action against HSSC chairman. The Opposition has been accusing the government of shielding the chairman by promising a probe in the Assembly. It has been demanding his dismissal and a probe by the CBI or other competent agency while pointing that an audio recording of his allegedly discussing graft payment is doing rounds in the social media. AAP has also accused the government of doing nothing to check the leakage of question papers in a series of exams in the state and also of delaying the recruitment against various posts. He claims that question papers have been leaked on no less that 19 occasions during the Khattar regime.",2018-04-11,," Led by 'local lad' Arvind Kejriwal, AAP seeks to expand its base in Haryana | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/led-by-local-lad-arvind-kejriwal-aap-seeks-to-expand-its-base-in-haryana-107436.html
357,Charu Kartikeya,"Political parties need events to survive. Every event gives politicians an opportunity to give their local network of political workers some work. Party machinery gets into action, coffers are opened, crowds are paid to attend, hoardings, posters and banners are printed, stages are set up and all other trappings necessary for making an event look successful are ordered. The key ingredient, however, is an issue. For events to be successful, they must have an issue at their core – either a demand to be made or an act of protest. Demands help politicians in rallying behind their cause while protests give them visibility. Another USP of successful political events is that the organising party/individual must be seen to be genuinely involved with the issue. If it is a demand, public interest must be proved and if it is a protest, then the organiser must not carry the impression of having been accused of the same ill at any point of time. Only the aggrieved can successfully protest against aggressor. Protests against corruption will be taken seriously only if the organisers are seen to be honest. Going by this yardstick, the BJP's one-day nationwide fast against disruption of Parliament appears to be nothing short of farce. The country has been told that the party, led from the front by reigning mascot Prime Minister  , is hurt by the way Congress and other opposition parties disrupted the just-concluded budget session of Parliament. The session was almost a washout, with demands and counter-demands by the opposition and treasury benches not allowing either of the two Houses to run without disruption for even a single day. Most of the opposition parties were riled at the way diamantaires Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi fled the country after duping several banks, most notably the public sector giant Punjab National Bank. The Opposition wanted the government to respond in Parliament, but the government appeared scared of the issue getting more limelight. The union government's failure to grant special status to Andhra Pradesh in spite of BJP's electoral promise to that effect also led to huge protests by Telugu Desam Party and Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP). TDP quit the BJP-led NDA midway through the session and YSRCP's MPs resigned from the Parliament by the end of the session. Both parties also brought no-confidence motions against the union government but the Speaker never took the motions up for debate. The   also contributed to this melee by protesting on the Cauvery issue. With this symbolic protest-fast, the BJP is trying to tell the country that the Opposition is responsible for the session's washout. For which of the issues enumerated above is the Opposition responsible? Isn't the government answerable when people accused of massive corruption suddenly leave the country? Shouldn't the ruling party be asked why is it reneging on its electoral promises? Is it fair then to lay the blame for the disruption in Parliament only at the Opposition's doorstep? If that indeed be made the yardstick to measure commitment to Parliament, the BJP is a front-runner of sorts on that count. During the Congress-led UPA's second tenure, the BJP didn't allow the Parliament to function right from 2010 to 2014. The then leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha,  , had then described parliamentary disruption as a legitimate tool to apply pressure on the government. If Modi wants to fast, there is no dearth of issues to repent for. On the policy front, he could fast for his failure to revive the economy and create jobs, for his damaging decision of demonetisation and for implementing a faulty GST system. He could fast for the continuing saga of suicides by farmers and for the failure of his government in improving their condition. Apart from governance failure, the BJP and its sister organisations operating under the aegis of the Sangh Parivar, have ignited a million fires across the country, in pursuit of their agenda of radical Hindutva. Dalits are being tortured and their constitutional protections threatened. Muslim men are being killed in the name of the cow and Muslim girls are being raped to serve a communal agenda. Saffron processionists are triggering communal passions in towns and villages across the country. If Modi and BJP want to fast, they must fast to repent for these ruptures their poisonous ideology has inflicting on the country's social fabric.",2018-04-12,," Modi should fast, but to atone for the million fires his reign has lit | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/modi-should-fast-but-to-atone-for-the-million-fires-his-reign-has-lit-107672.html
358,Rajeev Khanna,"The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) is all set to launch a water assault on the ruling   (BJP) in Haryana. INLD, which is the main Opposition party in the state at present, plans to launch a series of agitations across the state on the water woes next month. The party will be launching a 'Jail Bharo' agitation from May 1 and at the top of this would be its agitation on early construction of the Satluj Yamuna Canal (SYL) canal to get its water share from Punjab. Haryana is a state that will go to both the Lok Sabha and the state Assembly polls next year. The Assembly elections will follow the Lok Sabha in just a few months. It is a state that has till now been witnessing a triangular contest between the Congress, the BJP and the INLD but this time around Aam Aadmi Party ( ) is also expected to be a fourth contender. The INLD is a party that has a strong rural base, particularly in the Jat heartland. It has the advantage of inheriting the political legacy of an iconic farmers' leader Chaudhary Devi Lal. Over the last more than one year it has been trying to build a political narrative around the issue of water scarcity in Haryana. It has been particularly playing up the issue of the SYL canal. With a Congress regime in power in neighbouring Punjab and a BJP led central government in the centre, raising the noise decibel on the issue is otherwise also a good ideological move as it helps the party attain an aggressive posture against its two political rivals in Haryana. Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Abhay Singh Chautala has spelt out an elaborate programme on taking the water assault forward. The Jail Bharo agitation will start from the party's strong hold of Bhiwani on May 1. Thereafter the agitation will be held on May 4 in Yamunanagar, May 8 in Nuh, May 11 in Sirsa, May 15 in Narnaul, 18 at Kurukshetra, , May 22 in Fatehabad, May 22 in Palwal and May 29 in Kaithal. “We are warning the ruling government that once the agitation starts it will face difficulties in finding places to keep our arrested cadres as all the schools, colleges and stadiums will fall short of space,” he said. He further added that the party will not only focus on SYL alone. “We are also going to take up the issues of the Dadupur Nalvi canal project that was scheduled to carry water to the parched areas from the northern part along with Mewat canal that would benefit the parched areas of Mewat region, Palwal and Gurugram,” he said. The Dadupur Nalvi canal project was shelved by the Manohar Lal Khattar led BJP government in the state last year after more than Rs 300 crores had been spent on it since its inception. The scheme had been initiated in 1985 and the project was approved by the government for Rs 13 crore for irrigation and recharging of ground water in Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra and Ambala districts. Both the INLD and the Congress have been attacking the Khattar government for its move. Similarly while the Mewat canal was reportedly announced more than a decade ago, the region continues to be deprived of water. Chautala has the BJP government at the centre of diverting the attention of the people from the real issue of SYL by coming out with statements on diverting the water flow to Pakistan and using it for Punjab and Haryana. He was referring to the reported statement made by union water resources minister   in Rohtak last month where he had said hat the government would stop the Indian share of water flowing to Pakistan through Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers. Chautala has pointed that the real issue is completion of construction of SYL canal. “Instead of focusing on this, the BJP is trying to inject extraneous and peripheral issues. However, the INLD and the people of Haryana will not be diverted from the real issue and will make every effort to bring Haryana’s share of river water to the state,” he said. The INLD has asked Khattar to convene an all party meeting on the SYL issue to chalk out a strategy on how to take up the concerns of the state with the Centre. “If the government will not convene this meeting, we will hold one with all the political parties in the state,” he said. The INLD will also be raising the other concerns of the farmers during its proposed agitation on water. Chautala has accused the Khattar government of encouraging those who are 'looting' the farmers. He said that in the face of shoddy procurement mechanism by the government the farmers are compelled to sell their mustard produce to private players far below the minimum support price (MSP) announced for it. “Against the MSP of Rs 4000 per quintal, the farmers are compelled to sell their produce at Rs 3200 to Rs 3400 per quintal. I have seen farmers selling their produce at Rs 2850 per quintal at Nuh,” he said. Referring to the unseasonal rains that threatens the wheat crop, the INLD has demanded that the government go in for immediate procurement along with a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal to the farmers. The party has demanded a special girdwari (survey) of the crop loss and an appropriate compensation against the same.",2018-04-12,, INLD prepares for a water assault on BJP government in Haryana | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/inld-prepares-for-a-water-assault-on-bjp-government-in-haryana-107613.html
359,Akash Bisht,"Meanwhile, actor turned politician Kamal Haasan tweeted an open letter to the Prime Minister along with a video appeal wherein he is seeking an immediate intervention on the Cauvery issue. In his appeal, Haasan can be heard saying that the delay in setting up of the Cauvery Management Board is primarily because of BJP's political interests in Karnataka which goes to polls next month. “I think with your previous experience for Narmada Water Board Authority, you could easily deliver the justice that Tamil Nadu is seeking. Both pundits and pedestrians alike suspect and believe that this delay in getting justice is due to the elections in Karnataka and your interests in it. I want this belief to be dispelled for people are more important than elections,"" he mentioned in his video appeal. Haasan also sent an open letter wherein he is seeking an intervention by the prime minister himself on setting up the Cauvery Management Board. Modi must be utterly disappointed by the kind of response he received in the state considering BJP has major plans to make giant political inroads. Ever since the death of former chief minister J  , BJP was hoping to piggyback on  's cadre base to establish itself as a political force in the state where it had no presence whatsoever. Many believe that the whole idea of holding the DefExpo in the state was conceived with the intent to sway the electorate. It was also supposed to be a major event for defence minister Sitharaman, who hails from Tamil Nadu. It is no secret that the incumbent state government is taking direct orders from the BJP leadership which many believe has turned the AIADMK into BJP's B-team. This has not only hurt the BJP but also the AIADMK which has become a shadow of its former self. Modi and BJP president  's plans on making a grand entry in the state have been hit by the Cauvery bomb which has further weakened its chances of making any political impact in the state in the near future. On the contrary, the party appears to have become a liability in the state. The people of the state see BJP, particularly Modi, responsible for not implementing the Apex Court's order on the Cauvery issue. And if the BJP continues to ignore the demands of the people of the state, it  should gear up to face their wrath. In fact, in the RK Nagar bye-polls held in December, BJP received less votes than NOTA and it could be the same story whenever elections are held next. Overall, BJP's ambition of taking control of the southern states to improve its tally in the 2019 elections has taken a major hit considering how protests against Modi government are gaining momentum in states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. In these two states, parties opposed to BJP have raised the banner of revolt against the central government, which will have serious political repercussions. With Modi's popularity hitting an all time low at least in the south, protests against the central government spreading across southern states does not bode well for Modi's bid for a second term as prime minister.Prime Minister  's plans of impressing the people of Tamil Nadu by holding the 10th edition of the mega biennial event (DefExpo) in the state backfired completely after a sea of black flags and balloons greeted him on his visit. Agitated over Modi government's delaying Supreme Court's directions to set up the Cauvery Management Board, hundreds of protestors dressed in black took to streets to express their displeasure. In fact, black flags were hoisted on houses across the state in protest. The widespread protests led to the Prime Minister choosing a helicopter to reach the venue where he inaugurated the Land, Naval and Internal Homeland Security Systems Exhibition. The four day exhibition was opened by Union defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Wednesday, but it was Modi who inaugurated it on the second day which some exhibitors found to be bizarre. Meanwhile, Modi reached the Meenambakkam airport in Chennai in the morning which led to scores of activists raising slogans and holding placards with “Modi Go Back” written on them. In his bid to avoid the protestors, the Prime Minister took a helicopter to reach the venue which led to protestors releasing black balloons in the air. The massive protests across Chennai led to traffic snarls across the city. After attending the DefExpo, the Prime Minister was scheduled to travel to IIT Madras in the heart of the city. However, he was forced to take a chopper as Opposition parties dared him to travel by road. In his bid to avoid the protestors, Modi took a chopper to visit IIT campus. Once he deboarded, he had to take a car to reach the Adyar Cancer Institute situated within the campus. In the campus, Modi was yet again greeted by protestors holding placards. Even netizens took to Twitter to protest against the Prime Minister's visit using the hashtag #GoBackModi which was one of the top trends of the day.",2018-04-12,,  'Modi Go Back': How Tamil Nadu rose against the PM during his Chennai visit | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/modi-go-back-how-tamil-nadu-rose-against-the-pm-during-his-chennai-visit-107671.html
360,Sebastian Sunny,"Deepak Bajpai, who also happens to be a former media person—as many AAP leaders are-- has been active in Rajasthan in the past two months, touring districts and making attempts at enlisting local leaders in the party. AAP, which has set up a camp in the outskirts of Jaipur on Tonk Road,   is trying hard to make a foothold in the desert state by making tie-ups with likeminded groups and political parties like the CPI and the CPI (M). As such the party lacks an organizational structure in the State. “Kumar Vishvas had to go because he could not spare any time in Rajasthan where elections are due by the end of the year,” said Devendra Shastri, AAP spokesperson for Rajasthan, talking to Catch News.  Kumar was given enough time but he failed to make any link with the people and media in the State. “In the past eight months he visited Rajasthan only four times. Fan following in kavi sammelans is one thing and connecting with people politically is something else,” he noted. The party pointed out that Kumar Vishvas was not doing anything in Rajasthan for the coming elections and at the same time he was not stepping down himself. That necessitated the present action as time was running out. In the PAC meeting of AAP in Delhi two days back Rajasthan elections figured prominently and the party, it appears, is determined to invest its time and resources in the State. Despite the absence of any breakthrough for it in public and in the matter of getting hitherto established leaders of other parties to its fold, the AAP leadership thinks that Rajasthan holds promises for it. This is also because of the impression that the popularity of the ruling BJP is on the decline and the state does not have a third force. AAP thinks that it can fill the vacuum. Though it may appear grossly unrealistic, it is learnt that the party is preparing to contest from all 200 seats in the State along with its allies.  The party is in touch with the Left parties for a possible alliance in the coming Assembly elections while at the same time it is also on an attempt to woo party rebels from both the BJP and the Congress, besides former and present Independent MLAs.  Along with a tie-up with the Left and other likeminded parties, AAP is looking for a common ground for the campaign.   JAIPUR: The exit of poet and Aaam Admi Party( ) leader Kumar Vishvas as the in charge of party affairs in Rajasthan  a day back was as dramatic as his nomination to the post some eight months ago. As the appointment was without much logic as Kumar had no special connection with or knowledge of Rajasthan, his removal too was devoid of any special reason though the AAP insiders attribute it to “inaction”. The party leader Ashutosh, who announced the replacement of Kumar Vishvas as Rajasthan “prabhari” a day before  had termed the latter’s lack of time as the reason for excusing the fiery poet, now on a confrontation course with the AAP leadership, including its coordinator and Delhi Chief Minister  . Kumar’s disappointment over the denial of a Rajya Sabha ticket to him by the party is known to all. Now, he has been replaced by Deepak Bajpai, the national treasurer of the party, who is also a member of the party’s Political Affairs Committee (PAC).  ",2018-04-12,, AAP gearing up for Rajasthan polls | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/replacing-kumar-vishvas-aap-is-getting-battle-ready-in-rajasthan-107675.html
361,Catch Team,"After being criticised for his alleged reluctance to take a stand on the rape and murder of 8 year old Asifa in Kathua, Congress President   not just broke his silence but also organised an impromptu candlelight protest in Delhi. Accompanied by his sister   Vadra, brother-in-law  , senior Congress leaders like Ashok Gehlot, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ahmed Patel, Ambika Soni, Salman Khurshid,  , Ajay Maken and hundreds of Congress volunteers, Rahul Gandhi marched to India Gate in protest against the rapes in Kathua and Unnao. Gandhi said that as this concerned the safety of women it was a ""national issue, not a political issue"". ""We want the government to act...women should at least feel safe in the country,"" Gandhi said. As the police didn't let the protestors reach India Gate, Priyanka Vadra sat on the road in protest, along with All India Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev. Vadra didn't speak much, except for a brief moment when she scolded some of the protestors as they were ""shouting and pushing"". Speaking to the media on the Asifa case, Congress leader Salman Khurshid said, ""If this case doesn't stir your conscience, nothing will"". Azad chose to train his guns on   and  , chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh, the states where the two rapes took place. Azad's active presence in the rally is important as he hails from Jammu and had contested the Lok Sabha elections from the Udhampur-Doda constituency, under which Kathua falls. His presence was a clear signal to the Congress' Jammu unit, a few of whose members were alleged to have supported the Bandh called in favour of Asifa's alleged rapists. The protest march, which began from the AICC headquarters at 11 PM, is said to have been planned in barely a few hours. Delhi Congress leader Aman Panwar disclosed that the party held the protest late at night to avoid causing traffic disturbances in Central Delhi. Apparently, the Congress took a leaf out of the book of Maharashtra's protesting farmers, who marched at night to avoid disturbing students giving their board examinations. Over 1500 people had gathered for the Congress' protest near India Gate. A large number of them were volunteers from the Youth Congress, National Students' Union of India, Mahila Congress and other frontal organisations of the party as well as the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee. However, some common people, who had nothing to do with the party, also attended the protest. ""The cause is what brought me here. What happened to Asifa is a disgrace to humanity.

362,Rajeev Khanna,"The horror of Kathua rape and murder has found an echo in Surat where a body of an 11-year-old girl who was raped and tortured was discovered with no less than 86 wounds. The Prime Minister   or the  's (BJP) national president   are yet to speak on this horror that has come to light in their own backyard of Gujarat even as the masses protest on the gruesome rape episodes of Kathua, Unnao and now Surat. The stoic silence of Modi and Shah is nothing new to their home state where they have kept quiet or only come out with murmurs on some of the most horrifying cases that have been reported. The body of the Surat victim had been found in Pandesara area of the city on April 6. She had been dumped close to the national highway Reports say that the post-mortem has confirmed that she had been raped, tortured at length and strangled to death. There were severe injuries in her private parts reportedly caused by a blunt object. Her identity is yet to be ascertained although various theories continue to do the rounds including one that suggests that she was probably killed elsewhere and dumped in Surat. There is palpable anger among the masses and politics is hotting up over the issue. The police are also mulling action against those indulging in rumour-mongering on social media. Rapes are nothing new to India and so are arrests, convictions in some cases and acquittals in some. But the anger that has spilled on the roads after the Kathua and Unnao cases have more to do with the conduct of the BJP functionaries, whether it was at the time of trying to stop the Police from doing its job in Kathua or  's government drawing a flak from the Uttar Pradesh High Court that eventually saw a BJP MLA being arrested by the CBI. The anger is also over the delayed and 'mild' words coming from the otherwise twitter-happy Modi. People expect more sensitivity from the prime minister in times like these. It is in the latter context that one needs to revisit the Naliya rape case of Kutch district in Gujarat. Here the accused in the gang rape of the 34-year-old victim included some of the BJP leaders and office bearers. The police had booked ten persons in the matter. The victim was allegedly forced into a sex racket after the accused raped her for more than a year from August 2015 onwards. She had reportedly filed a complaint in January 2017 alleging that the accused recorded a video of the act and had blackmailed her. “She had alleged that there were no less than 65 accused supplying 35 women to various people including political bosses. The uproar had forced the BJP government in the state to set up a commission of inquiry in March last year,” says social activist Meenakshi Joshi of Forum of Concerned Citizens that has been pursuing the matter. While announcing the Commission under Justice (Retired) AL Dave the minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja had said that the panel would submit its report within three months of its first sitting. Joshi says that the irony is that the Commission started functioning after 11 months and three days of its constitution which speaks a lot about the seriousness of the government. The Commission has now advertised twice for people to come forward and depose but no one has submitted an application for deposition till now. “ Do you think people will have faith if there is such a delay in the functioning of the Commission. As it is the people fear for their safety. We are now once again trying to persuade the people to come forward and depose,” Joshi told Catch. The Commission has received three extensions till now. The ten accused booked by the Naliya Police included Shanti Lal Solanki who was convener of the OBC cell in the BJP’s Abdasa taluka unit, Govind Parumalani who was a secretary in the BJP’s Gandhidham unit, Vasant Bhanushali and Ajit Ramwani who were BJP councillors in Gandhidham municipality. All the ten were arrested and the BJP was compelled to suspend four leaders. However, there was no noise coming from Modi, Shah or any other senior BJP leader in this case. Then who can forget the Patan 'marks for sex' scandal that had come to light in 2008? Here a Dalit girl student had alleged that she had been sexually abused repeatedly by none other than her six teachers at the Primary Teachers' Training College College in Patan, the constituency then represented by former chief minister Anandiben Patel, who at that time was Gujarat's education minister. The College was the theatre of protests as many more girls had accused the teachers of molesting them for giving them higher internal assessment marks. The government was compelled to set up a fast-track court and eventually the guilty were convicted. The six accused are: Manish Parmar, Mahendra Prajapati, Ashwin Parmar, Suresh Patel, Atul Patel and Kiran Patel. While five of them are serving a life term, the sixth one is reportedly serving a ten year sentence. Modi was the chief minister at that time and had remained silent over the entire episode except for one occasion where he had reportedly called the incident as the most 'shameful act' and promised all necessary steps for protection of girl students. Like other states Gujarat has also witnessed some of the most horrifying rapes that have gone under-reported. These include the gruesome rape of a two and a half year old Nepali girl in Halol at the time when protests in Nirbhaya rape case were at its peak and the Bijal Joshi rape and murder case.

However, Gandhi, who in the recent past has lost no opportunity to attack the government, remained uncannily silent on the acquittal of Aseemanand and four others in the 2007 Mecca Masjid Blast that killed nine and injured dozens. Not even his party has said much on the judgement which witnessed a dramatic twist after the judge that acquitted the accused resigned soon after giving the verdict. When asked about the party's reaction on the verdict, party's national general secretary and in-charge of organisations and training, Ashok Gehlot called it a judicial matter and said he would not like to comment on it. “It is now up to the government to examine the order and decide if a further appeal is required. As it is a judicial matter, I would not like to comment on it,” he said Monday. Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, too tried to avoid the question. When repeatedly asked, he only had this to say: “There is always the option of appealing in higher courts.” The most interesting response came from senior party leader PL Punia, who was asked to comment on BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra's allegations that the Congress had coined the term 'saffron terror'. In his response, Punia said, “Rahul Gandhi or the Congress party have never used the term 'saffron terror'. It's baseless. There is no term like 'saffron terror'. We believe that terror cannot be linked to any religion, community or caste. Criminal mentality leads to criminal activities which should not be linked to any community or religion.” While other Opposition parties have attacked the BJP government for diluting the case, Congress has so far maintained an eerie silence. Congress leaders might deny coining the term 'saffron terror', but there is ample evidence to suggest otherwise. It was probably first used by the then Home Minister P Chidambaram in 2010 when he cautioned the chiefs of state police forces, security and intelligence officials against saffron terrorism. “There is no let up in the attempts to radicalise young men and women in India. Besides, there is the recently uncovered phenomenon of saffron terrorism that has been implicated in many bomb blasts of the past. My advice to you is that we must remain ever vigilant and continue to build, at the Central and State levels, our capacity in counter-terrorism,” he was quoted by the The Hindu in 2010. Thereafter, in 2013, party leader   Shinde had accused BJP and RSS of promoting “Hindu terrorism”. Back then several senior party leaders had backed Shinde who was eventually forced to issue a clarification. According to a cable by former US ambassador, which was released by Wikileaks in 2010, even Rahul had mentioned how radicalised Hindu groups were a bigger threat to India. So, why did Congress or Rahul not raise this issue when all the accused were acquitted by the court despite several reports of how the entire probe was scuttled? The resignation of the judge and appointment of a public prosecutor who has no experience in criminal trial – and was a member of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad – being handed such a sensitive case does raise serious questions about the way the probe was conducted. And, yet the Congress remained silent. The only logical reason for this ignorance could be the upcoming polls in various states, particularly Karnataka. With elections in the southern state only a fortnight away, the Congress would not have wanted to be seen as an anti-Hindu entity considering how Rahul has been temple hopping in the state to get support of the majority community. In the past, Congress has often been accused by the BJP of minority appeasement while ignoring the sentiments of the majority community. Rahul had adopted a similar strategy in Gujarat where it, for the first time in the last many years, was able to give BJP a tough fight in their own bastion. Though Congress failed to form government, it succeeded in confining BJP's tally to not cross two digits. Elated with such a response, the party has deployed a similar strategy in Karnataka and is likely to adopt it other states where it goes to polls later this year. Perhaps for this reason that the party has held itself back from raising Aseemanand's acquittal to ensure it isn't seen as a party that represents the interests of only one community. In fact, after its disastrous performance in 2014, the party had formed AK Anthony committee to look into the reasons for its failures. In his report, Anthony had claimed that the party was increasingly seen as pro-minorities which had done little to protect the interests of the majority community. His observations found many takers in the party and eventually in 2017 during the Gujarat elections, the Grand Old Party decided to woo the Hindus with Rahul visiting temples across the state. “It would have been foolish to get drawn into this anti-Hindu debate being created by the BJP. We have an election to fight in Karnataka and taking the BJP's bait could cost us the elections. We have to be very careful. Moreover, everyone knows what Congress is all about,” said a senior party leader from Karnataka. This leader, however, agreed that its not secret that investigating agencies are being pressurised by the government to let the accused go scot-free. And yet, he would not want to go one record on this. “There is no official or unofficial diktat to not speak on these issues but Congress leaders know that they have to avoid it at all costs. We do not want to have a Mani Shanker Aiyer-like moment right before the polls,” he said.",2018-04-17,, Mum seems to be the word for Congress on Mecca Masjid.

364,Rajeev Khanna,"When I think of this Ram Swarup, I am reminded of the story of ‘Kalu Bhangi’ written by Krishan Chander, one of the most eminent progressive short story writers produced by the subcontinent in the last century. What can I write about Ram Swarup except for the fact that he was a mere sanitation worker in the factory premises where I grew up. True, he was the most sought-after by those residing in the factory quarters because he worked with sincerity and regularity besides being polite and courteous to the housewives calling them ‘bibiji’. He went along the damp and dirty drains on the posteriors of the quarters to enter the old styled washrooms and clean them up with phenyl, acid or bleaching powder, whatever was made available to him. As a child, I used to wonder why I had never seen him entering a household from the front. His “limit” ended at the point where he rang the door bell or knocked on the main doors to collect his paltry allowance that came over and above the pittance that the factory management paid him. At times he was seen requesting the women to give their ration cards so that he may avail some benefits not taken by them from the public distribution system outlet. He had a wife named Lakshmi, the name I have found very ironical ever since I cam to terms with the phenomena of caste in society. How could Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, live in abject poverty? I had seen their house once on the fringe of a beautiful village that had numerous plum, apricot, peach and pear trees. But this hovel stood next to the outlet of dirt and squalor of the village. As a child I had thought why these people could not build their house in a beautiful surrounding like the other villagers. That is all I know about their family. They did not have off-springs as far as I know. Lakshmi was a jolly woman who was employed as a house help in just one house. Today I recognise why her livelihood ended at just one household and that too at the house of a non-caste Nepali family in the area. As I travel back almost four decades, I just remember that her employers were happy with her work and the best part was that she sang very well. I used to go to the neighbouring house just to hear this woman sing. She was rendered unemployed very soon, never to be seen in the area again. But Ram Swarup continued to toil endlessly with an unending hope that often bordered on conviction that he would become a permanent employee of the factory very soon. The factory had a pretty bizarre custom of organising a blood donation camp every year on the occasion of the birthday of the managing director in Delhi every year. I call it “bizarre” because employees were lured or forcibly herded to donate blood every year as if they were already not giving their blood and sweat to the organisation. Come summers and there used to be a commotion among the employees, both white collar and blue collar ones on how to avoid going to the blood donation camp that was no less than going to Guillotine. Some opted for availing medical certificates while others opted for availing leave or taking the sycophant route. But what could poor Ram Swarup, a daily wage casual sanitation worker, do? Despite his sincere execution of job, he was given a break in employment every few months so that he may not claim regular employment from the company. For him, this blood donation meant pushing his case for regular employment a bit further. He did not need to be coaxed or persuaded for the annual Delhi trip that ensured his boarding and lodging in lieu of his blood, no matter that a single look at his face and dark complexion would convince anyone that he was not in robust health. Yes, he donated his blood year after year without any complaint for more than one and a half decades. But he did not achieve his goal of a permanent job. Every year people would joke with him on his endless wait and he would get back saying that he would get that elusive permanent job the next year. Then all of a sudden, Ram Swarup vanished. Some other sanitation worker started attending to the needs of the households. Nobody would have missed Ram Swarup had there been no comparison between the jobs executed by him and the others. It was learnt that he not only left the temporary job at the factory but also the town with his wife, never to be seen again. What came of him remains unknown. But whenever there is a mention of him, the sad and sordid tale of his donating blood for that little paying but elusive job does come up and several more such examples are given. Much later in life when I reported and came across instances of young sanitation workers dying in the manholes of Ahmedabad after inhaling poisonous gases, I was often reminded of Ram Swarup. These young men too get paltry payments by the contractors in the only hope that one fine day they would be enrolled as regular employees of the local civic body. I had once seen Ram Swarup carrying a calendar with the picture of Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar. He had asked me, a small school-child, whether I knew who this man in a blue suit was. All I could tell him at that age was that Ambedkar was the father of the Indian Constitution, an all powerful document that made us citizens the most powerful in our democracy. This was the time when there was no cable television and another Dalit icon Kanshi Ram was emerging on the scene. Today, I can gather that perhaps Ram Swarup knew very little about Ambedkar. I am sure that nobody in his family, even the generation before him, had availed any reservation benefits. The same is true for all those youngsters who have been dying in the man holes of this country. These youngsters might be aware of what Ambedkar stood for but continue to be denied their rights – social and economic. It was just last week that my house help in Chandigarh told me how she is arranging for Rs 40,000 so that her son gets enrolled as an outsourced sanitation worker. Just a couple of days back, the old man sweeping the road outside my house came requesting if I could find any job for his educated son, a job of an office boy or a sweeper. Just about a ten days back I could see the confusion on the faces of several people from the Dalit communities as I went around the city after the 2 April Bandh called against the 'dilution' of Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Many did not know what it was all about. A number of them thought it was in response to something said against Ambedkar. Still others thought that there was a move to snatch their reservation rights which would further deprive them. Even as attempts are being made to target Ambedkar, destroy his statues, paint him saffron, add 'Ramji' to his name, one thing is for sure that he remains as relevant as ever. He cannot be belittled. People like Ram Swarup and crores of others are yet to realise what Ambedkar means for them and how they can take baby-steps on the path that he showed.",2018-04-14,, Why we need BR Ambedkar today more than ever before | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/pov/why-we-need-br-ambedkar-today-more-than-ever-before-107928.html
365,Rajeev Khanna,"The Congress government in Punjab has sought conviction of its Cabinet minister and cricketer turned politician   in a 30-year-old road rage case that is being heard in the Supreme Court. On the face of it there should not be anything surprising in this because the case is being contested between the state and Sidhu where the latter is an accused. It is because of a series of developments over all these years that Sidhu with passage of time has moved from cricket to politics and after jumping parties has landed up as a minister in the government led by Captain Amarinder Singh. But politics is a game where everything is seen with a political prism and this development has rattled a lay man who does not understand law one one side and on the other tongues have started wagging. This is because the development has come at a time when the Congress is at a critical juncture in Punjab and the recent developments within the party have been sending wrong signals in society. The public perception that is emerging is quite contrary to the law taking its own course. At this point of time, a conviction for Sidhu will be a big blow to the party not only in Punjab but across the country. It was on Thursday evening that reports came about the Congress government in Punjab asking the Supreme Court to uphold Sidhu's conviction in the 1988 road rage case of Patiala. The Supreme Court had granted bail to him after he had been sentenced to three years in prison by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The the victim's family has appealed for enhancing the quantum of punishment given by the lower court. The prosecution has reportedly been maintaining that Sidhu along with a friend was in a car parked at a road crossing in Patiala on December 27, 1988. The victim Gurnam Singh and two others were going to bank and had found Sidhu's car blocking the way. Gurnam had sought that the car be moved so that he could drive through. After an altercation Sidhu had allegedly hit Gurnam who was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. Sidhu had reportedly been acquitted of the murder charges by a trial court in September 1999 saying the 65-year-old Gurnam had died of a heart attack and not brain haemorrhage. However, the High Court had reversed the order in 2006 holding Sidhu and his friend guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The court had sentenced them to three-year imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 1 lake each. Interestingly it was the Captain Amarinder Singh led Congress government in power when this conviction had come about. However, in 2007, the Supreme Court had stayed their conviction paving the way for Sidhu to contest the Amritsar Lok Sabha by-poll. After Thursday's development, Sidhu has said that he will submit to the law. Just a couple of days back the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had alleged that the Congress government had deliberately fielded a junior advocate to contest the state’s case against Sidhu to subvert the cause of justice and help Sidhu walk free in the homicide case. Former minister Bikram Singh Majithia had said the Congress government’s intentions on the issue of safeguarding the interests of the common man had become clear after the heirs of an old citizen who was 'killed' by Sidhu were provided with a weak defence to subvert the cause of justice with the clear motive to win a reprieve for the minister. “This family has already been saddled with the cost of litigation for decades. Now when it has come up with compelling proof in the form of a televised self confession by Sidhu that he was present at the scene of the crime, that he had entered into an altercation with Gurnam and even landed fist blows leading to the latter’s death, the Punjab government has started working overtime to get Sidhu off the hook,” he said. But political allegations and counter allegations apart, the general perception is that Sidhu is perhaps the only Congress leader in Punjab who has a pan-India appeal and can be one of the top campaigners for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls although his absence from the party campaign in both the recent Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh polls is yet to be explained. Observers say that over the last one year Sidhu has emerged as another pole within the Congress in Punjab. “By involving the local MLAs while deciding upon things pertaining to his ministry, he has managed to strike a chord with them apart from developing a good network among the local level party leaders. This is something that heavyweights like Amarinder and finance minister Manpreet Badal lack,” pointed an observer. In the last one year, Sidhu has emerged as a leader who has been most vocal in demanding action from his own government on the promises made in the run up to the Punjab Assembly polls of 2017. He has sought action from Amarinder against those involved in running 'drug mafia' as well as the 'cable mafia' in the state. This development comes at a time when Amarinder stands cornered for not acting against the Akalis on various issues. Over the last two days there have been signs of his relations going frosty with the Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar. On Wednesday Jakhar had left in a huff without meeting Amarinder when the security personnel asked him to deposit his mobile handset at the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) in Punjab Civil Secretariat. The two were scheduled to together at a function in Bhawanigarh in Sangrur on Thursday but this time Amarinder failed to turn up blaming a chopper glitch. Another interesting dimension being given by some observers is that if the state can change its stance 360 degrees like it did in case of none another than Amarinder himself in the Ludhiana City Centre and Amritsar Improvement Trust scams why can't it be done in case of Sidhu ? These are legal matters that require legal expertise to answer but for now politics is surely on the boil in Punjab.",2018-04-14,, Punjab govt seeks Sidhu's conviction in old road rage case.

366,Atul Chandra,"The   government in Uttar Pradesh, which loves to beat its own drum about the crackdown on criminals, decided to brazen it out by refusing to arrest  ’s Bangarmau legislator and rape-accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar. As CM Adityanath and the state police chief OP Singh showed no signs of embarrassment in letting the accused roam freely, Advocate-General Raghvendra Singh apparently took it as a hint to tell the Allahabad High Court that the accused won’t be arrested. Needless to say, the Court was not amused. The Advocate-General told the Bench headed by Chief Justice Dilip B. Bhosale quite bluntly said that the accused Kuldeep Singh will not be arrested before the completion of formalities prescribed under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P.C.). Evidently displeased with Singh the Bench said, “We are constrained to record the approach and attitude of the learned Advocate General during the course of hearing, in contending that no accused person, including Kuldeep Singh, can be arrested without the Investigating Officer following the procedure prescribed under CrPC and collecting evidence in support of the allegation of rape,” the Court said. Referring to the AG’s statement, the shocked judges said, “It is sought to be urged that the FIR has been registered by the police against Kuldeep Singh on 12 April, 2018 and that the Investigating Officer after recording statement of witnesses, including the accused and the prosecutrix under Section 161 CrPC would proceed, and on credible evidence, the accused may be arrested but as on date he submits that the accused Kuldeep Singh would not be arrested on merely registering of the FIR.” An angry Bench tore into the AG and in a severe indictment remarked, “The approach of the learned Advocate General is not only appalling but shocks the conscience of the Court in the backdrop of the instant case.” A former law officer said he did not recall any other advocate general of the state being rebuked by the Court in this manner. “The job of the advocate-general is to assist the court which did not appear to have been done in this case,” he said. But this was not the first time that Advocate-General Raghvendra Singh has been pulled up by the Court. In August last year when Singh was found absent in an “important and serious” case against Adityanath, the Court not only reprimanded him but also passed restraining order against him. The Court asked the AG to remain in Allahabad for the case. A senior lawyer was unable to recall if a similar order was passed by the Court against any other advocate-general of the state. In the same case, to the astonishment of judges, the advocate-general contradicted his colleague, additional advocate-general Manish Goel on a point of law. Such is the AG’s attitude that even the Supreme Court indicted him and asked him to appear before it and explain why he had not been appearing when summoned by the high court. On April 3 this year, Justice Dr Devendra Kumar Arora and Justice Virendra Kumar-II passed the following order in a service related matter, “After arguing at some length, learned Advocate General Mr. Raghvendra Singh has submitted that the order impugned in this petition will be withdrawn…” This is what the court said when the matter again came up for hearing on April 9, “Today when the case was called on, learned Advocate General is not present. However, learned Standing Counsel submits that he has received instructions for seeking four weeks’ further time for taking steps/passing of the order.” Before dismissing the request for more time, the upset judges said it was “unfortunate and disheartening” that the authorities have “shown scant respect to the undertaking/statement given by the learned Advocate General before the Court that the impugned order would be withdrawn …”",2018-04-16,, Unnao rape: How UP A-G Raghavendra Singh has become an embarrassment.

367,Charu Kartikeya,"The case of state governments run by the BJP having already enforced the Supreme Court's order on the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act is a classic demonstration of the BJP's double-speak. Rattled by massive protests against the SC's order, the  -government has urged the top court to review it. Additionally, BJP leaders including Modi and several Union ministers have been on an overdrive trying to convince Dalits that the government will not allow the original law to be diluted. On the other hand are three BJP state governments, which have instructed their police to strictly implement the SC's order. The order, announced on 20 March, forbids arrest under the Act without prior sanction. Dalits say this amendment has diluted the Act. An investigation done by the Indian Express has revealed that governments of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have issued formal orders,  the state police to strictly implement the SC order. In stark contrast, the Left Front government in Kerala has independently moved court against the order. This is an option that was available to all state governments and yet, at least 3 of them run by the BJP have gone ahead and enforced the order. The BJP, in any case, has had a duplicitous approach towards protection of Dalits. Historically, the Sangh Parivar has held deeply casteist beliefs and the record of the Modi government in the area has not been any different. Throughout the last four years, several major attacks on Dalits have taken place and the BJP has always been found complicit in either the act itself, or in supporting it later. Tinkering with quotas has always been a priority areas for the BJP and the NDA government has now gone ahead and   a huge blow to the system by reserving seats for for SC, ST and OBC teachers department-wise and not calculating them based on the aggregate posts in a university. BJP leaders in various parts of the country regularly manage to hit headlines for making casteist comments. The latest in this galaxy is Gopal Bhargava, a Cabinet minister in Madhya Pradesh, who has   suggested that talent is being “insulted” in the country because of the quota system. Ironically, Bhargava is the Minister for Social Justice in the state government. Earlier, BJP MLA from Goshamahal constituency in Hyderabad, T. Raja Singh, had endorsed the flogging of Dalits in Gujarat's Una. Union Minister Anant Kumar Hegde had also courted controversy after comparing Dalits with “barking dogs”. Welfare of Dalits is not the only area in which the BJP's doublespeak has been evident. Its slogan “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas” has also been exposed to be hollow with the multiple attacks on Muslims in the last four years. The electoral representation of Muslims is also shrinking because of the BJP staying away from giving tickets to them. “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” also saw a similar fate, with several BJP leaders themselves having been found indulging in crimes against women.

368,Sulagna Sengupta,"Uncertainty looms over the ongoing West Bengal Panchyat Elections scheduled for 1,3 and 5 May as Calcutta High Court has given a stay order on the election process with the next hearing scheduled on 16 April. Calcutta High Court on Monday asked the State Election Commission (SEC) to provide an account of what steps have been taken to deal with complaints by Opposition parties. In response, the ruling All India Trinamool Congress has decided to appeal to the Division Bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday. Soon after AITC decided to appeal to the Division Bench of Calcutta High Court, the BJP has decided to file a caveat at the Division Bench regarding filing of nominations. Partha Chatterjee state parliamentary affairs minister said “We decided to approach the Division Bench as Opposition parties are unnecessarily trying to disrupt the poll process. They do not have the required manpower to contest the election. Polls will be held on schedule.” Meanwhile the SEC has instructed district administrations to halt preparations for the polls, including training of officials for the poll process, until the High Court decides on the matter. Most experts now believe that the polls might get rescheduled. Makhanlal Majumder, former election commissioner of Bihar said “ There are high possibilities that the Panchayat election might get rescheduled after Calcutta High Court gave a stay order on Thursday. I feel that Calcutta High Court will ask the Commission to provide fresh dates for submission of nominations to those who weren't able to file their nominations. The poll schedule will change as a result”. Meera Pande, former state election commissioner, said “After the Calcutta High Court's stay order, there is uncertainty over conducting polls on the scheduled dates. It needs to be seen how the case progresses in the Calcutta High Court.” The Calcutta High Court has also imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on the BJP for misrepresentation and suppression of facts . Kalyan Banerjee, a senior lawyer and AITC MP said “I appealed to the Court on Wednesday that BJP has suppressed the fact that they had already moved the case to the Supreme Court. As a result on Thursday, Honourable High Court imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on the BJP.” The CPI(M) welcomed the High Court’s decision but went ahead with a six-hour bandh on Friday. However, in protest against the CPI(M)'s bandh called by the CPI(M) , the West Bengal government took all measures to foil it. They issued an order instructing the West Bengal government employees to be present at the office on Friday and threatened to deduct salaries if they remained absent, unless the leave had been sanctioned earlier. The state government also arranged for extra buses during the bandh so that school and office goers weren't affected. Soon after the Calcutta High Court order, Left student organisations organised a demonstration near the SEC office alleging that democracy is in peril and that the SEC is acting according to the whims and fancies of the state government.

369,Rajeev Khanna,"The Aam Aadmi Party ( ) has arrived on the political scene in Haryana. The party has decided to contest all 90 seats in the next Assembly elections there, scheduled to be held a little after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This was announced by Delhi chief minister and AAP National Convener   at a huge public rally in Hisar Sunday. It was Kejriwal's first major public outing in the region after the Punjab polls. There the party, after threatening to walk away with the winners' trophy, had to contend with being the main Opposition. In Haryana, AAP does enjoy some advantages. At the same it also has several questions to answer.  Haryana is the home turf of Kejriwal and some of the ministers and legislators the party has in Delhi. It can make a marked presence particularly in the areas of the National Capital Region (NCR) using a spill over of its Delhi support base. AAP volunteers have been quietly working on the ground for sometime, which was evident from the response of people in the rally. Party's Haryana chief Naveen Jaihind said it would offer the Delhi model of governance to the people of Haryana: “basic amenities like power and water at cheaper rates, more compensation to families of martyrs, more remuneration and compensation to farmers.” In fact, the implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission is one of the major promises made by Kejriwal in his speech at the rally held at Old College Ground in Hisar. He said AAP will strive continuously to overthrow the ruling   (BJP). He accused the BJP of organising riots in the country and said both the Congress and the BJP were responsible for riots between Jats and non Jats. Caste violence continued unabated in the last three years and Manohar Lal Khattar government slept over it, he added. Holding the central government responsible for a series of bank frauds Kejriwal posed a question to Modi asking when will defaulters like Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya be brought back to India. He said the people are worried where to deposit their hard earned money as none of the banks is safe.  Armed with documents Kejriwal told the audience that the Centre has filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court saying that it would not implement the Swaminathan Commission report. He took an oath saying that AAP would implement it on coming to power in the state and Haryana would be the first beneficiary. Kejriwal also attacked the state government on poor health facilities, education facilities and the degrading law-and-order scenario. He said the corrupt practices introduced by the previous government of Bhupinder Singh Hooda have seen a five-time rise in the Khattar regime. He said AAP would soon start a door-to-door campaign in the state. Delhi's Labour and Employment Minister Gopal Rai, who is also AAP's Haryana in-charge, said the state has made valuable contribution in Delhi's development and Delhi Transport Corporation as well as Delhi Police owe their success to Haryana.  But questions remain. AAP needs to convince the masses that it is a serious contender and would not back out from contesting it did in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat, leaving enthusiastic supporters disappointed.  The party will have to ensure it does not make the mistakes it made in Punjab where over-ambitious leaders justified the saying of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The party will have to make its presence felt in the heartland of the state to debunk the theory being propagated by several observers that it will just prove to be a force that will cut into the vote share of the existing non BJP parties, the Indian National Lok Dal and the Congress. With AAP announcing its entry into the poll fray just a little more than a year ahead of the Lok Sabha and Haryana assembly polls it remains to be seen how the political matrix of the state changes in the coming months.",2018-03-26,, AAP wants to contest in Haryana ; Can it change the political matrix of the state | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/aap-wants-to-contest-in-haryana-can-it-change-the-political-matrix-of-the-state-104882.html
370,Anil Chamadia,"The way the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha are being repeatedly adjourned since March 5, it appears that Parliament will continue to function in a similar manner until the elections next year. Things have come to such a pass that it seems the Rajya Sabha chairperson and the Lok Sabha Speaker begin proceedings only to announce that the House has been adjourned.  Who is to blame for this? Is it just because of the din created by the Opposition? Or is there more to it? The answer lies in the rationale behind the decision to adjourn both Houses.  Rajya Sabha chairman M Venakaiah Naidu presided over the Upper House for the first time on 11 August, 2017. That was the last day of the 243rd session of the Rajya Sabha. The session continued for 19 days. Subsequently, the 244th session of Rajya Sabha continued for 13 days from 15 December, 2017 to 5 January, 2018 under his leadership.  The 245th session of the Upper House is the Budget Session, which normally happens to be a long session. This session began on 29 January and continued till 9 February. And then, it was adjourned till 5 March.  Resuming on 5 March, the proceedings of the Parliament have been regularly adjourned. The Rajya Sabha Chairman's decision to adjourn is the House is being seen as strange. It can be understood in the light of the following facts.  Since 5 March, just after resuming at 11 AM. the proceedings of Rajya Sabha were adjourned till 2 PM. by the Chairman. In between, only two days – on 6 March and 15 March - the proceedings of the Upper House continued after 2 PM. Otherwise the pattern of adjournment was such that first the House would be adjourned till 2 PM and then subsequently for the next day.  Interestingly when the Upper House resumed after 2 PM on 6 March, the Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien came in place of the Chairman to preside over the House. He, cited disruptions and adjourned the House till 3.30 PM.  On 15 March, too, the Deputy Chairman adjourned the House till 3 PM. But on both days, after 2 PM, he tried hard to ensure that the House resumes after the adjournment of one hour. He was, on both occasions, in favour of taking one more chance to restart the proceedings. The clearly appears to be a difference in approach between the Chairman and Deputy Chairman regarding the functioning of the House.  A similar difference can be seen in the Lok Sabha as well.  Even by Naidu's own standards, his approach in this session has been different from what he followed in the previous session of Parliament.  During 244th session of the Rajya Sabha which lasted 13 days, Chairman Naidu had adjourned the proceedings of the Upper House after 11 PM. Till 2 PM for just two days.  During that session, the Upper House was adjourned for the first time on 21 December, 2017. That day, Prime Minister   was scheduled to be present during the Question Hour in the Upper House. At that time, the Opposition members of the House were demanding a clarification on his allegation that former Prime Minister   had conspired with Pakistan during the Gujarat Assembly elections.  22 December was Friday and the House worked till 2.30 PM. Therefore, it was emphasised that there should be consensus to conduct the proceedings. .  The history of Rajya Sabha normally testifies that once the need for adjournment arises after the commencement of the proceedings at 11 AM, the Upper House is adjourned till 12 noon in the first phase.  As 12 noon is the time for Question Hour, several members expecting answers from the government for their questions, readily agreed to run the House. In the Lok Sabha, the Question Hour is scheduled at 11 A,M. During his tenure, former Vice President   had decided to start the Question Hour in the Upper House at 12 noon. During the 14th session of 16th Lok Sabha, the proceedings of the Lower House began at 11 AM. for the Question Hour and thereafter since 12 noon, it was adjourned for the day. In parliamentary proceedings, Question Hour is extremely important. On 7 February Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Agrawal suggested that Question Hour be suspended in order to ensure participation of maximum members in the debate on the President’s address. But Chairman Naidu spoke at length on the importance of Question Hour. He said that Question Hour was the right of every member and depriving members of this right would be very painful.  But after 5 March, the House has been convened every day only to be adjourned. This was evident on 16 March. That day, after commencement of the proceedings there was no disruption and pandemonium in the House. Still, Chairman   announced his decision to adjourn the House for the day.  While pronouncing his decision, he commented that the Opposition is demanding a discussion only on the Punjab National Bank scam. He asked why, instead of the scam in Punjab National Bank, there should not be a discussion on all scams that had taken place so far in the banking sector? The mammoth Rs 11,000 crore scam had rocked Parliament, ever since it resumed on 5 March.  It is being felt as if both Houses of the Parliament have resumed only to hear out the decisions of adjournment from the respective presiding officers. This is particularly the case in the Rajya Sabha where no effort appears to have been made to keep the House running. Going by the series of adjournments, it appears that this trend will continue in both Houses, until the general elections. The delay in the Winter Session due to the Gujarat Assembly elections is also an indicator of what lies ahead. The elections got over on 14 December and a brief Winter Session took place from 15 December to 5 January.  It seems that the current ruling dispensation is apprehensive of parliamentary proceedings as it believes that they may influence the public discourse and have an impact on the minds of voters. This is the reason why we are witnessing ridiculous situations in the conduct of parliamentary proceeding these days.

371,Akash Bisht,"  Having been given a free hand to run the party during the recently held plenary session, Congress president   has made three key appointments on Tuesday which are likely to set the ball rolling for many such changes that are expected in the months to come. On Tuesday, Rahul appointed Amit Chavda as the president of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee president putting to rest all speculations around former chief Bharatsinh Solanki's resignation. Earlier, there were reports of Solanki tendering his resignation as state unit chief after being denied a Rajya Sabha berth from his home state of Gujarat. However, these reports were dismissed by the Congress and Solanki as well. On Tuesday, the party finally acknowledged that Solanki had in fact resigned from the post. A statement released by the party read: “The party recognises the services and contribution of Shri Bharatsinh Solanki who has relinquished the responsibility as the GPCC president,” read the statement released by the Congress. The 41-year-old Chavda is a first cousin of Solanki and has been a four time MLA from Borsad and Anklav constituencies in Anand district. Chavda became a member of the 11th Gujarat legislative Assembly after he won a bye-election from Borsad. He won the Borsad seat again in 2007 after which he contested from newly formed Anklav seat in 2012. Thereafter, he won the recently held Assembly elections in the state with a comfortable margin and was chosen as party's chief whip in the Assembly. Considered close to Rahul, Chavda is considered as the next generation leader of the party in the state who is also popular amongst the Thakor and Kshatriya community. In fact, Chavda, an OBC, will help in consolidating the votes of the community and will bolster Congress' chances in 2019. Rahul's promise of giving youth more prominence reflects in how appointments have been made in the state. Earlier, the party had appointed 41-year-old Patidar leader Paresh Dhanani as Leader of the Opposition. In other developments, party has replaced K Raju with Nitin Raut as the chairman of the Scheduled Caste department. Considered as one of the crucial figures in Rahul's inner circle, Raju is most likely to be accommodated in the Congress Working Committee and made party's general secretary. Earlier, during the plenary session, Congress passed a resolution, giving Rahul absolute powers of choosing his own team in the CWC. Sources have informed that Raut, a Dalit leader and former state minister from Maharashtra, has been accommodated in the SC department to end the faction fight in party's Maharashtra unit. “Raut has been at loggerheads with several leaders from the Nagpur unit of the Congress. And by giving him this responsibility, Congress president has attempted to end the feud in the state unit,” said a Congress leader from Maharashtra. Raut's name has cropped up several times in the past for the party's state unit chief but he never made the cut. The decision to appoint him as the chairman of the SC department is likely to help Congress in consolidating Dalit votes from the Vidhrabha region of the state. Moreover, experts feel that the Bhima Koregaon incident is likely to see Dalits shift their loyalties towards Congress and Raut's appointment could help it in securing a major chunk of this crucial vote bank. Meanwhile, the party has also appointed Tamradhwaj Sahu as chairman of the OBC department. Sahu, a sitting MP from Durg, Chhattisgarh, will replace RC Lenka, who stepped down from the post of chairman. During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Sahu was the only Congress leader to have won from Chhattisgarh. OBCs form a major chunk of the electorate in Chhattisgarh and Sahu remains one of their tallest and most popular leaders from the state. Interestingly, in 2014, Sahu had defeated BJP's Saroj Pandey, who was recently elected to Rajya Sabha from the state. Keeping in the mind that Chhattisgarh goes to polls this year, Congress would be hoping to woo the community with Sahu's elevation. OBCs form nearly 48% of the state population and it remains to be seen whether Congress' strategy pays off.  ",2018-03-27,, Rahul Gandhi stamps his authority over Congress by making key party appointments | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/rahul-gandhi-stamps-his-authority-over-congress-by-making-key-party-appointments-105073.html
372,Akash Bisht,"With General elections a little over a year away a gamut of parties have started assessing their positions, especially vis-a-vis the   (BJP). In this respect, the political situation in Uttar Pradesh has become particularly interesting, what with the state sending the most number of members to Parliament. The coming together of   (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party ( ) in recent bye-polls have opened up new possibilities and stakeholders are closely assessing the situation. A transfer of votes between the two parties can potentially be a  .  Needless to say, when battle lines are drawn, BJP's bete noire Congress would want to be in the game. But how accommodating would others be to the Grand Old Party, especially since creases to a prospective alliance remain unironed.  Already, BSP supremo   sprang a surprise Tuesday, a day after claiming the alliance with the SP would not be hampered by the defeat of BSP's Bhim Rao Ambedkar in the recent Rajya Sabha elections. Now the BSP will no more activate its cadres in any upcoming bye-election the way it did in Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-polls, the Dalit leader said Tuesday. This has come as a major setback for the SP, which will now have to contest bye-polls for Kairana Lok Sabha and Noorpur assembly seats on its own. Mayawati had asked her cadres to support SP candidates in the two earlier bye-polls, which helped  's party clinch massive victories in the seats earlier represented by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya. In return, it was decided that the SP would vote Ambedkar for Rajya Sabha. Ambedkar's loss led to political pundits writing obituaries of a potentially formidable social coalition. Amid speculations, Mayawati reiterated support for the alliance Sunday and Monday, saying it would be good for the country. According to her, any effort by ruling BJP to create a divide between the two parties would only backfire. She urged other parties to join hands too.  Her flip-flop can leave the SP unnerved. Meanwhile, BSP sources downplayed her comments, claiming the alliance was here to stay. By not activating her cadres, particularly in Kairana, she wanted to send a strong signal to   (RLD), which was planning to field party chief Ajit Singh's son Jayant Chaudhary.  The party had pledged support for Ambedkar for the upper house of Parliament, but the vote by its legislator was declared void. Mayawati thinks this was on purpose, to help the BJP, and said she would rethink about any understanding with RLD. A BSP source said the invalid vote could have triggered Mayawati's strong reaction: “She doesn't contest bye-polls, but this does send a strong signal to possible allies.”  UP Capital Lucknow has been abuzz ever since Mayawati publicly supported an alliance with SP. Senior politicians have been meeting respective party leaderships to secure election tickets. Speculations are rife that the BSP has already started preparations for 2019 General Elections, identifying seats it would like to contest.   recently claimed the BSP chief might fight from Ambedkarnagar – a clear departure from her earlier stand of not contesting election. While the two parties seem to be close to sealing a deal, others – particularly Congress – will have to bargain hard. Numbers are not stacked in favour of the Grand Old Party for it to have a say in seat-sharing and it will have to give up its ego if it wants to enter the alliance.  Senior Congress leadership may hope to be treated on a par with the two allies, but both the SP and the BSP dismisses that. Congress's decision to contested Phulpur and Gorakhpur irked their leaderships who are not averse to fighting without the Congress in case it demands “more than what they deserve”. A senior Congress leader recently dismissed the idea of the party being a junior partner in an alliance and said the demand would be for an equal share of seats to contest. “Should we down shutters? We are the oldest party and deserve some respect,” he said. When asked whether contesting the bye-polls was a mistake, he denied and said the party should have been given one seat to contest by the alliance.  The party did push for a seat – a demand that was categorically turned down by the SP. “They remain oblivious to the harsh realities on the ground. Had we given them a seat, we would have lost. Strategically, an alliance with Congress is not even in our favour and we can very well do without it,” a senior SP leader said. When asked how many seats would the Congress be allotted if it enters into alliance, he promptly said: “Two – we want their top leadership to win but that is it. They do not have winnable candidates and even if we rally behind them, it could still be a lost cause.”  In fact, even the Congress is divided over the number of seats it deserves to contest. A Congress leader from the state claimed there were not more than five out of UP's 80 Lok Sabha seats the party could win next year.  For the SP leader, even five was a tall number. “We gave them enough in the past. Look at the results – out of the 105 seats it contested in 2017, it won only seven – a proof of its popularity in the state,” he said.  Negotiating with Congress was hard work, according to him. “One leader would want some seats, another some others – there's too much confusion. Also, they scheme against each other. Congress is like Kalidas who cut the branch on which it sits,” he said. According to him, Congress should focus on other states where it is powerful if it wanted to see   defeated. “We have to work together at different levels if we have to fight the common enemy. Inflated egos won't win elections, but ensure defeat,” he said.  Mayawati too wasn't pleased with Congress, sources said. Especially, the induction of Nasimuddin Siddiqui, a former BSP man, into Congress hasn't gone down well with her. She was also upset with the party fighting bye-polls. A BSP source said others like RLD, NISHAD, Peace Party, Apna Dal might have to be accommodated in a broader alliance, something that would make it increasingly difficult for Congress to jostle for more seats.  In 2014, the BSP came second on 34 seats. Mayawati would like to fight those as well as a few more. The SP too would prefer a similar number. That leaves less than 10 seats for other allies. “Realistically, Congress should not be given more than five seats but it depends on future negotiations,” a BSP source said. Meanwhile, top Congress leaders have already started approaching the state leadership for seats. “It also depends on how many of them can win,” said Ramesh Dixit, state president of Nationalist Congress Party. It was too premature to discuss seat sharing, considering Congress was not yet in the alliance, he said. “Other parties also are yet to join the alliance. Every effort should be made to build a grand alliance to defeat the BJP, but every party should be reasonable with its demand,” Dixit said. He claimed the Karnataka Assembly elections on 12 May could be a turning point as could be the polls in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. However, he said, it would still be tough for the Congress.  “Look at their recent performances in the state. No party or alliance that has the potential to defeat the BJP would want to lose seats to satiate the ego of an alliance partner. That's not how politics works. “Congress will have to be realistic, else it will end up damaging the chances of those who have better chances of defeating the BJP,” he said.  Nationally, several parties have already started discussions. West Bengal Chief Minister Tuesday met NCP chief Sharad Pawar and  's Sanjay Raut while her Telangana counterpart K Chandrasekhara Rao recently called on her. Such trends could eventually lead to regional satraps coming together to form a non-BJP, non-Congress front. Congress thus needs to think seriously.

373,Sulagna Sengupta,"In her efforts to bring together various anti-BJP parties, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee came to Parliament on Tuesday and held a series of meetings. She met   MP Sanjay Raut and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) MP K. Kavitha and daughter of Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao in Parliament and went to Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar's home for dinner. She said she will also meet prominent BJP dissidents Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie among others on Wednesday. She is said to have urged all regional parties and dissenters within the BJP to come together. “I have spoken with leaders of various parties like DMK, NCP and RJD and after discussing with them it was decided that those regional parties who are strong in their own state should fight BJP alone, but those regional parties which are not strong should align with Congress to fight BJP,” she said. “ For example in Uttar Pradesh,   and   should join hands together to fight the BJP,” she added. The West Bengal CM further urged SP president Akhilesh Yadav and   chief Mayawati to call a joint meeting of Opposition parties in Lucknow. “Similarly in Andhra Pradesh Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP is strong enough to fight BJP. In Maharasthra, NCP will fight the BJP. Every party has compulsions but they must compromise for the betterment of the nation,” she said. Referring to the proposed No Confidence Motion against the BJP, Banerjee said, “I have heard that many BJP MPs will vote against them and this is why the government has not allowed a no confidence motion. BJP is scared of its own MPs”.

374,Ashwin Aghor,"Thousands of Dalits from across the country visit Bhima Koregaon village to pay tributes to Mahar soldiers in British Army who defeated the Peshwa's army on 1 January 1818. This year was the 200 years celebration of the event. However, the otherwise peaceful event at Bhima Koregaon village turned violence when people belonging to Upper Castes opposed it and allegedly assaulted the Dalits.  The violence soon spread across the state bringing it to grinding halt. Prakash Ambedkar called a Maharashtra bandh on 3 January to protest the assault on innocent Dalits. He also accused Sambhaji Bhide, founder of Shiv Pratishthan, of being behind the violence. Ambedkar had also alleged that former BJP corporator from Pune Milind Ekbote also instigated the violence against Dalits. Ekbote was arrested last week, after the Supreme Court rejected his anticipatory bail. Prakash Ambedkar had taken out an Elgar Morcha in Mumbai on 26 March demanding Bhide's arrest. He also met Fadnavis to press his demand.  Maharashtra Chief Minister Davendra Fadnavis has given a clean chit to Sambhaji Bhide, who was alleged to be the mastermind behind the violence against Dalits at Bhima Koregaon in January this year. Fadnavis told the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly that there was no evidence to prove that Bhide was involved in carrying out or instigating the violence. He said that the investigating agencies checked location of Bhide and other important leaders of his organisation for the last six months and found nothing objectionable. It was also found that Bhide was not even in contact with the people involved in the violence against Daltis, he added. Replying to the debate on the issue in the House, Fadnavis informed that the complaint was lodged by a woman who, deposed before Judicial Magistrate that the complaint was based on hearsay and she did not have direct evidence to allege Bhide’s involvement in the violence. “Since there is no direct evidence against Bhide, there is no question of acting against him,” Fadnavis told the House. He also clarified that the investigations are still going on. He said that the fresh evidence that has been provided by Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh leader Prakash Ambedkar is now being investigated. When contacted, Ambedkar said, “CM Fadnavis is misleading the House. I have given clinching evidence against Sambhaji Bhide. His supporters, in a Facebook post on 1 January, had said that Guardian Minister for Pune district Girish Bapat and CM Fadnavis should be killed since they (followers of Bhide) could not reach the desired number. This is clear evidence of the violence propagated by Bhide and his followers. It also proves that Bhide and his organisation was behind the violence at Bhima Koregaon.” Ambedkar also alleged that the government is eager to give clean chit to Bhide because of his proximity to Prime Minister   and CM Fadnavis. “When Fadnavis informed the House that there was no evidence against Bhide, the Opposition should have confronted him. The so-called fresh evidence given by me that Fadnavis is talking about, was actually given in January, immediately after the violence,” Ambedkar said, adding, “I hope the Opposition corners CM Fadnavis in the House.”    ",2018-03-27,, Bhima Koregaon violence: Fadnavis gives Bhide a clean chit.

375,Rajeev Khanna,"For the first time in almost three-and-a-half decades Punjab's students would get to elect representatives to students' councils. Tuesday the Amarinder Singh government announced elections to student unions in universities will be held from the 2018-19 academic session, thus fulfilling one of the promises made by Congress before last year's Assembly elections. Apart from establishing a democratic process at grassroots, this will also be a major indicator of what the youth thinks and wants. In addition, a new political leadership can also emerge from educational institutions now instead of only from rich and powerful families. Though there are still several issues related to the implementation of the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations in the universities, it is a positive start. Captain Singh pointed out such elections were suspended due to the state's disturbed law-and-order situation in the past. Now that there is peace and normalcy, students' elections will take place regularly. The Panjab University, Chandigarh had seen a return of elections in 1996, following a sustained agitation by the student and youth leaders. Amarinder said students' union elections would be held in Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar; Punjabi University, Patiala and Punjab Technical University, Jalandhar along with their affiliated colleges. Other universities where elections are to be held include Baba Farid University of Health and Medical Sciences, Kotkapura; Punjab Agriculture University and Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University both in Ludhiana. Elections to the students' bodies were discontinued at the height of militancy in Punjab after Operation Blue Star in 1984. The perception then was that universities were hotbeds of militancy and several militants took refuge in campuses. Also, criminal elements had started using student politics as covert. Normalcy returned to Punjab by mid-'90s, but no party in power displayed the political will to resume students' elections despite demanding and making political commitments.  There are various views on this. One: students with political aspirations have often accused rich, powerful families of resisting students' polls as they could hamper the political prospects of their own progenies.  The other view is that political parties had no inkling of the thought process of the youth and lack of political debate was being seen as one of the reasons for the youth going directionless. Political observers think such elections would provide an opportunity to various political forces to groom their armies right from the grassroots. In addition, leaders would also emerge on merit of their understanding of political thought from campuses instead of from a few families with clout. Punjab has two major student organisations – the National Students Union of India (NSUI), affiliated witto the Congress, and the Students Organisation of India (SOI), the students wing of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).  In addition, there are Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) – student wing of rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh – the Students Federation of India (SFI), backed by Communist Party of India (Marxist).  Several other leftist student's organisations also work at the grassroots and bring out of various publications and organise people's movements in rural areas. In the '80s the All India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF) had a strong presence. The government's decision is expected to improve considerably political debate, the standards of which are particularly worse in private universities where students are treated almost as in primary schools with political debates and activities being prohibited. Recently the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana also re-introduced such polls after almost 22 years. Elections had been done away with by the earlier Bansi Lal-led Haryana Vikas Party (HVP) government in the state on the grounds of growing violence in campuses, including murders.  The decision came after a sustained agitation by Indian National Students Organization (INSO), the student wing of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD). Even the NSUI and SFI had been demanding these elections. The re-introduction of students' polls are expected to give a new shape to politics in both these states. It remains to be seen how the change comes about and who capitalises on students' politics.",2018-03-28,, Student council polls to be back in Punjab.

376,Anurag Dey,"The bid to initiate impeachment motion against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra may be gaining traction, but the Opposition camp seems to be divided with some including the Mamata Banerjee-led All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) appearing to be unconvinced by the move. The move comes over two months after four top Supreme Court judges publicly accused the CJI of misusing his administrative authority. In the unprecedented media conference in January, Justices J S Chelameswar , Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph had said important matters were being assigned to a bench of preference comprising junior judges. Mooted first by CPI(M) General Secretary   in January, Congress is said to have recently circulated a draft proposal of the impeachment motion against the CJI over alleged impropriety. The draft motion lists several charges against the CJI including “conflict of interest” in the medical college scam case and “misusing administrative authority as the master of roster to arbitrarily assign politically sensitive cases to select judges”. Confirming the move, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders Majid Memon and DP Tripathi said signatures from prominent political parties including the Congress and Left have been collected. Among other to endorse the proposal is the   (SP). “The Samajwadi Party stands with the impeachment motion, which is about bringing independence and unquestionable integrity to the judiciary,"" SP leader Ghanshyam Tiwari was quoted as saying by ANI.  Advocate activist Prashant Bhushan met West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool supremo Mamata Banerjee in Delhi and is said to have discussed in details about the move. Bhushan has been actively campaigning for Misra’s ouster as the CJI after the apex court dismissed his two petitions seeking a SIT probe into the Lucknow medical college scam involving a conspiracy to bribe the top judiciary. Levelling charges of conflict of interest, forgery and derailing the CBI probe into the case, Bhushan had earlier sought a Supreme Court in-house probe against the CJI. While Banerjee informed reporters that her party will go with what the rest of the Opposition decides, insiders say the Trinamool appears to be skeptical about the move and has suggested treading cautiously. In her efforts to build an anti-BJP front, Banerjee is in Delhi talking to prominent Opposition leaders including NCP chief Sharad Pawar, UPA chairperson   and Delhi chief minister  . “Impeachment motion against no less than against the CJI, has enormous implications. The Opposition has begun to understand the need for uniting against the BJP. At such a crucial juncture, any misadventure which may discredit the entire Opposition is the last thing one would want,” said a source. “There are issues which need to be deliberated before a definitive move can be made. The charges against him are that he has acting in an arbitrary way. But what is significant is, whether his arbitrary conduct is guided by an ulterior motive, and whether that is apparent enough? “The charges against him are serious but are they grave enough to warrant impeachment. Moreover, are there sufficient grounds to convince the house the need for initiating impeachment and finally do we have the numbers? “It all depends on these questions being answered in the affirmative satisfactorily,” the source said. As per the Judges (Inquiry) Act, a motion must be signed by 50 members of the Rajya Sabha or 100 MPs of the Lok Sabha and submitted to the presiding officer of either House, who will set up a committee to examine it. Only if the committee is convinced that the motion has merit would it be debated and voted on. To pass, the motion must be supported by the majority of the House with not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting. Even if the Opposition manages to get signatures of 50 members for the motion in the Rajya Sabha, it is likely to be shot down by the Chairman who under the Act, is empowered to do so. Sceptics are also pointing to the Opposition’s failure to bring in a no-confidence motion against   government.  “The outcome of the trust vote is a foregone conclusion, yet the government has been blocking it. The Opposition has struggled to get even the Speaker’s attention, so how come one can think they will allow the impeachment motion,” asked a leader. BJP leader   has accused the Congress of trying to put pressure on the CJI ahead of the verdict in the Ayodhya dispute, which is being heard by a bench presided by the latter. Congress leader and advocate Kapil Sibal who represented the Sunni Waqf Board in the case, withdrew himself after reportedly being asked to do so by his party. “It is the Congress which promoted him as a high court judge, made him the Delhi HC chief justice and finally elevated him as a SC judge in such a way as to ensure that his seniority enabled him to become the CJI. And now at the fag end of his career, they are making this move. Perhaps apprehensive that the Ayodhya verdict may go in our favour, the Congress is trying to scuttle it,” said Swamy. Among the other parties, BJP's ally  ,, also preferred to be a fence sitter. While expressing alarm over the situation in the judiciary, Sena MP Sanjay Raut said his party was discussing the issue and will take a call later. The move has also been criticised by the legal fraternity. Former Attorney General, Soli Sorabjee called it a 'ill-conceived' moved. “It is a highly ill-conceived move and there is no ground for impeachment. Impeachment can be for serious misbehaviour or incapacity neither of which exist in the CJI's case. ""It will affect the public perception of the independence and neutrality of the judiciary. I am totally against it,"" he said. The International Council of Jurists (ICJ), which had earlier red flagged Misra elevation as CJI for alleged corruption, accused the Congress of blackmail and vendetta. “When we had objected to his appointment as CJI then the Congress did not bother, but now after suffering series of legal setbacks they have come with this,´ ICJ president Adish C Aggarwala. The ICJ in August 2017 had  the President and the then CJI JS Kehar opposing Misra’s elevation as the CJI over his alleged involvement in a land scam in Odisha while he was an advocate. “It’s the CJI bench which ordered reopening of the anti-Sikh riot case and directed a SIT probe. Besides the Bofors case before the Supreme Court, the Congress has been facing flak over Sibal move to seek deferment of the Ayodhya case till the next Lok Sabha polls. “This impeachment motion by the Congress reeks of its intent to settle score with Misra and blackmail the judiciary,” said Aggarwala.

377,Sulagna Sengupta,"  The deployment of central forces in the upcoming Panchayat elections in West Bengal has once again become a bone of contention between the ruling All India Trinamool Congress and Opposition parties. The elections are scheduled to be held in the first week of May. Leaders of certain Opposition parties have met State Election Commissioner Amarendra Kumar Singh to demand deployment of central forces in the panchayat elections. Even in the Panchayat elections held in 2013, the Opposition had demanded deployment of central forces but the state government didn't agree. Ultimately the matter was taken up by the Supreme Court. After the Supreme Court's directive, West Bengal was forced to deploy Central forces in the 2013 panchayat elections. A meeting was convened at the office of the West Bengal Election Commission on Thursday with the state home secretary and chief secretary also present. During the meeting, the West Bengal government urged state the Election Commission to conduct polls in the first week of May, without deployment of Central forces. The notification for the elections is likely to be issued in the first week of April. Sources in the state government said that in its letter to the State Election Commission, the West Bengal government said that they did not need any Central forces. It said that around 56,000 state police personnel will be deployed for the Panchayat polls. After the all party meeting , CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said “The West Bengal government has failed to tackle law and order problems during the Ram Navami processions. How can they conduct an election without deployment of Central forces. We have demanded the deployment of Central forces.” Sources in the state government said that the Panchayat election will be held in three phases. The West Bengal government wants to finish the election before Ramzam, scheduled in last week of May. Meanwhile, the BJP has threatened to move court if the State Election Commission finally decides to conduct the election on first week of May. According to the BJP, as Higher Secondary examinations would be going on, it would be difficult to campaign. They also said that if elections are held in the first week of May, they will get less time for campaigning. Therefore they have urged the state election commission to revise the dates of the elections. Dilip Ghosh, state BJP president, said “We will move the Court if the State Election Commission decides to conduct the election on the first week of May as we are not getting time for political campaigning. Moreover, we have also demanded the deployment of Central forces as the state government has failed to control the law and order situation of the state.” It may be mentioned that the 2013 panchayat election was held in the first week of July in West Bengal and it was held in five phases.  ",2018-03-29,," Trinamool, Opposition trade charges on deployment of Central forces in Panchayat polls | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/trinamool-opposition-trade-charges-on-deployment-of-central-forces-in-panchayat-polls-105469.html
378,Sulagna Sengupta,"This followed fresh violence in the Asansol-Raniganj coal belt Wednesday after which the state administration issued prohibitory orders, sent a huge contingent of police led by three senior officers, clamped down on internet services and asked local TV channels to not broadcast anythingn that could trigger violence. The situation reached this stage as villagers in the area resisted a BJP rally Monday. In the ensuing clash 10 villagers were injured and an Indian Police Service officer lost an arm while trying to defuse a crude bomb. In another instance, a statue of freedom fighter Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad was overthrown by a mob sporting saffron bandannas in North 24 Parganas district's Kakinara. Before that, Sunday a man died after being caught in a clash between the police and rival Ram Navami processions. There were many more instances of violence between the two parties and   at several rallies. Even as the state continued to cope with violence Chief Mamata Banerjee was seen New Delhi, meeting senior politicians from various Opposition parties Tuesday and Wednesday.  Politicians, expectedly, blamed each other. BJP State President Dilip Ghosh blamed Trinamool's “double standards” and said “While (the party's) goons tried to create disturbance in various areas, the police and administration failed to discharge their duties.” Jishnu Bose, state general secretary of BJP's mentor   (RSS), alleged the Azad statue was vandalised by Trinamool goons carrying BJP flags. He also claimed that several workers of Trinamool and Communist Party of India (Marxist) joined RSS rallies. Trinamool's Sourav Chakraborty, member of the Legislative Assembly from Alipurduar, was spotted at an RSS Ram Navami rally Sunday. In Kakinara too, sources said, Trinamool legislator Arjun Singh was in a procession with RSS workers. He though denied that and blamed RSS for vandalising the Azad statue. The CPM's Surjya Kanta Mishra, meanwhile, blamed parties of “wanton competitive communalism” and wondered why could the state not seek central forces if its own contingents fell short. Chief Minister Banerjee has already turned down a Central offer for the same and held back Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi from visiting the disturbed coal belt area. As the political class traded blames, the situation has left the state's intellectuals worried. They see a trend that was set ever since winning two Lok Sabha seats in 2014 made the BJP try to garner more by consolidating Hindu votes. That Trinamool is now competing with it will only increase religious polarisation, they feel. One question that has been on everybody's mind is why did Trinamool take out Ram Navami rallies in the first place? A Kolkata-based intellectual leaning towards Trinamool claimed the party had to do so to keep the BJP from creating communal disturbances in the state. It couldn't take a risk after the saffron party made its intention clear with  . Veteran historian Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri, however, felt that was pointless: “If a ruling party needs to showcase strength, it should be in the vote bank rather than giving too much attention to Ram Navami rallies. A counter rally signifies it is giving importance to another party.” In a state where caste and religion did not dominate politics, such “competitive communalism was detrimental”, politica analyst Amol Mukherjee said. “This will widen religious polarisation and increase communal tension. Evern since coming to power in 2014 the BJP has tried to consolidate Hindu votes and communal clashes have increased eg, Dhulagarh and Baisrhat,” said the former principal of Presidency College. He agreed with Bhaduri that Trinamool had better not organised rallies: “The ruling party must understand it has not been elected to indulge in competitive communalism. It should rather act when law is violated. It is necessary not to give mileage to such rallies.” Theatre activist Koushik Sen pointed out that the state had a strong social fabric. The need was to introspect what's good for the society. “Such rallies showcasing arms are not only detrimental to the society but also a cause of concern for the common people,” he said highlighting the death of one villager Sunday.  “Trinamool's counter-rallies only prove it would copy the BJP. That would only give an edge to the BJP help increase its base in Bengal,” Imankalyan Lahiri, professor of International Relations at Jadavpur University, said. “It's the duty of all political parties to maintain law and order. They should not indulge in wanton competitive communalism,” Sohini Roy, who has taught Sociology in St Xaviers College, said. “It is dangerous for Bengal, which has never been ruled by caste or religious politics. As a symbol of its unity, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore once celebrated Raksha Bandhan between Hindus and Muslims,” she added.Will this year's Ram Navami turn out to be a watershed in the way politics is done in West Bengal? Or is this rampant violence a passing phase? These are questions foremost in the mind of socio-cultural analysts and political observers. Ram Navami processions took a bloody turn Sunday with clashes between supporters of Trinamool Congress and   (BJP) – the political parties in power in the state and the Centre respectively – at several places throughout the state. Since then the violence has continued and has taken a communal turn. Even Thursday television cameras captured a tense Asansol. A predominantly Hindi-speaking Hindu mass complaining their processions were pelted with stones while Muslims alleged that   against them were raised in such processions. Union Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Babul Supriyo, who represents Asansol in Lok Sabha, now has an FIR registered against him for violating Section 144 even as the police stopped him from entering the city. He, in turn, demanded that the Mamata Banerjee government be sacked.",2018-03-29,, Did this Ram Navami change politics in Bengal  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/did-this-ram-navami-change-politics-in-bengal-105471.html

380,Rajeev Khanna,"Aam Aadmi Party's ( ) suspended Lok Sabha member from Patiala in Punjab, Dr. Dharamvira Gandhi, is finally all set to part ways with the party. Dr Gandhi has announced the formation of a new forum named Punjab Manch which is expected to evolve into a formal political party in the course of time. He has stated that he will quit AAP the day this Manch becomes a political party. Dr Gandhi along with Fatehgarh Sahib MP Harinder Singh Khalsa have remained Lok Sabha MPs for the last three years despite being suspended by their parent party for alleged anti-party activities. Reports coming from Delhi indicate that Khalsa is also likely to join Dr Gandhi's forum soon. Over the years Dr Gandhi had been saying that he would continue to raise people's issues in the parliament and not quit because it was the people who had elected him for this purpose. With AAP's top leadership neither throwing out these two MPs nor revoking their suspension even during the crucial Punjab state Assembly polls, the two have continued with their work. Dr Gandhi had emerged as a giant killer in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls when he trounced the former minister of state for external affairs Preneet Kaur who is also the wife of the present Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh who is still looked upon as Maharaja on his home turf. This victory had come about during the 'Modi wave' and it was Dr Gandhi's personal reputation and rapport with the masses that had a major role to play in it. With his departure, the question that arises is whether AAP will be able to find a replacement that can match his repute and credibility. There is a large section of the electorate in Punjab that believes that the AAP's top leadership should have tried to mend fences with Dr Gandhi and Khalsa, the two MPs out of four that it had suspended in March 2015. They were sacked for speaking against the expulsion of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan from the national executive of the party besides being critical of the working style of AAP's national convener and Delhi chief minister  . AAP has recently appointed senior leader Dr. Balbir Singh as co-president of Punjab unit and given him the responsibility of revamping the organisational structure. Dr Balbir had played a key role in ensuring Dr Gandhi’s victory in 2014 polls as his campaign manager. He also has a considerable clout in Patiala and had lost to Amarinder from the Patiala (Urban) seat last year. Despite being suspended, Dr Gandhi has continued to make headlines by taking up people-oriented issues in the parliament as well as in various other seminars and programmes. Floating the Punjab Manch, he said, “Our objective is 'Federal India, Democratic Punjab' and our vision is for a country strongly rooted in democracy, arising out of a comity of individual states exercising federal powers, as envisioned in the Constitution which speaks of a 'Union of States'. The country has been let down by the Congress in the name of 'national integration' and the   (BJP) in the name of 'nationalism'. The diversity of the country has to be acknowledged and honoured.” He said the Punjab Manch believes that the essence and true destiny of India can only be achieved by the threads of its cultures and races working fully and harmoniously, weaving a much richer, holistic tapestry. “At present, the sum of its individual constituent parts are largely subservient to the yoke of an overly-strong, stifling, and unsuitably centralised government,” he said. He said the Punjab Manch aims to build a country where diversities of all hues, enjoy opportunities to flower as part of a larger bouquet, fully realizing the idea of ‘unity in diversity’. “To achieve this objective, the Manch shall strive for the correction of distorted centre state relations to achieve a truly federal India. The Manch also stands for fully democratising state administration and building a democratic society at large,” he added. Dr Gandhi has been in news for taking up issues which no other political party dares to raise. In December, he was in news for raising the issues pertaining to farmers' land being 'forcibly' taken over by the Dera Radha Soami in Beas. He had reportedly taken up the matter with the Union Home Minister   requesting him to look into the property of the Dera and the plight of farmers who are forced to sell their land to it. There were later reports about his facing threats on social media and on the telephone. He has also been leading the fight for providing affordable health care to the masses. He has been advocating that the government needs to regulate private healthcare industry and has approached Prime Minister   on the issue. He has sought that the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) be asked to take necessary steps to expand the list of medical devices under price control. He has also been demanding that the government take necessary measures to control the prices of diagnostics and other investigations and impose price control on healthcare charges. Just two days back he staged a dharna in the Parliament complex demanding compensation to Punjab for sharing waters of Ravi, Beas and Sutlej with non-riparian states of Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan. Sitting near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi for two hours before the Lok Sabha convened for the morning business, he said, “Punjab’s financial condition is in the red. It is not in a position to carry out welfare projects for people. On account of the Centre's decision, Punjab has been pushed into sharing its rivers waters with other states. The state’s own water table has depleted alarmingly affecting daily lives of the people. Either the beneficiary states should pay the compensation or the Centre must step in.” He has also garnered a lot of respect in Punjab for his efforts on getting a Sikh Marriage Act implemented. How the Punjab Manch fares as a political force remains to be seen in the days to come but Gandhi's departure from AAP will surely create a big vacuum that will be very difficult to fill, particularly at a time when AAP would be looking towards improving its tally of MPs from Punjab.",2018-03-30,, Dharamvira Gandhi set to part ways with AAP: Why the party should have patched up with him | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/dharamvira-gandhi-set-to-part-ways-with-aap-why-the-party-should-have-patched-up-with-him-105610.html
381,Anurag Dey,"On a day when various organisations have called for a nationwide shutdown, protesting against the 'dilution' of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, [SC/ST Act] by the Supreme Court, the   governent moved a review petition.  The Supreme Court verdict attracted widespread condemnation by activists who work for Dalit rights as well as politicians cutting across party lines.  Besides Dalit activists, legal experts, Opposition parties, the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) also expressed their anguish over the dilution of the Act that defines and criminalises atrocities against SC/STs. Even a section within the ruling   and its allies expressed opposition. “We have filed a comprehensive review petition that will be presented before the court,” Union Law Minister   said Monday. On 20 March an apex court Bench of Justices AK Goel and UU Lalit, while examining the need for procedural safeguards to prevent the abuse of the SC/ST Act, issued directions in effect diluting the provisions related to immediate arrest for offences under the Act. Observing that “there are instances of abuse of the Act by vested interests” the Bench removed the mandate of immediate arrest under the Act and directed that arrest can be made only after preliminary inquiry and sanction by the competent authority. It also removed the “absolute bar” on an accused taking recourse to anticipatory bail.  In the verdict, the Bench laid the following:  The Bench also stated that any violation of the directives (2) and (3) “will be actionable by way of disciplinary action as well as contempt.” The court stated that “to avoid false implication, before FIR is registered, preliminary enquiry may be made whether the case falls in the parameters of the Atrocities Act and is not frivolous or motivated”. With the court’s directive, not only a person accused under the Act will not be arrested unless a preliminary enquiry is conducted to ascertain the veracity of the charges, but s/he also has the relief of seeking anticipatory bail, which was hitherto unavailable.  Deliberating on section 18 of the SC/ST Act that bars the applicability of anticipatory bail to an accused, the Bench observed that the legislature “never intended to use the Atrocities Act as an instrument to blackmail or to wreak personal vengeance”. “It has been judicially acknowledged that there are instances of abuse of the Act by vested interests against political opponents in Panchayat, Municipal or other elections, to settle private civil disputes arising out of property, monetary disputes, employment disputes and seniority disputes. It may be noticed that by way of rampant misuse complaints are ‘largely being filed particularly against Public Servants/quasi judicial/judicial officers with oblique motive for satisfaction of vested interests’. “Innocent citizens are termed as accused, which is not intended by the legislature. The legislature never intended to use the Atrocities Act as an instrument to blackmail or to wreak personal vengeance.  “The Act is also not intended to deter public servants from performing their bona fide duties. Thus, unless exclusion of anticipatory bail is limited to genuine cases and inapplicable to cases where there is no prima facie case was made out, there will be no protection available to innocent citizens. Thus, limiting the exclusion of anticipatory bail in such cases is essential for protection of fundamental right of life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the Bench said. During the hearing, the petitioner while arguing on misuse and abuse of the Act, pointed to the low conviction rate of cases and “large number” of false cases. It was pointed out that in 2015, out of 15638 cases decided by the courts, 11,024 cases resulted in acquittal or discharge, 495 cases were withdrawn and 4,119 cases resulted in conviction. Quoting the National Crime Records Bureau figures, the petitioner stated that in 2016, over 6,000 cases were found to be “false”. The court was also informed that out of the cases disposed of by courts in 2015, more than 75% resulted in acquittal/withdrawal or compounding of the cases.  The court, in this regard, observed:  “We are satisfied, in the light of statistics already referred as well as cited decisions and observations of the Standing Committee of Parliament that there is need to safeguard innocent citizens against false implication and unnecessary arrest for which there is no sanction under the law which is against the constitutional guarantee and law of arrest laid down by this Court. “... the said Act cannot be converted into a charter for exploitation or oppression by any unscrupulous person or by police for extraneous reasons against other citizens as has been found on several occasions in decisions referred to above.  “This Court must enforce such a guarantee. Law should not result in caste hatred. The preamble to the Constitution, which is the guiding star for interpretation, incorporates the values of liberty, equality and fraternity. While the Bench reiterated the misuse and abuse of the provisions of the Act, what it failed to realise as pointed out by experts, that the low conviction rate was actually a reflection of the way cases under the Act are registered and pursued.  Human Rights Watch in a report “Hidden Apartheid: Caste Discrimination against India’s ‘Untouchables” had observed: “The low rate of convictions, compared against the high number of atrocities reported against Dalits, speaks to the caste bias of prosecutors, as well as other organs of justice, including the judiciary. On the very day of the judgment, Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment   in Lok Sabha informed that the number of cases of offences of atrocities against members of SCs registered under the Act in conjunction with the IPC, have gone up to 40,774 in 2016 from the 38,564 in 2015.  According to  , the number of cases of crime against SCs pending for trial has increased manifolds. From 85,264 case in 2006 the figure has seen a 50% rise to reach 1,29,831 case by 2016. Besides the removal of bar on anticipatory bail, experts say the court’s mandate for a preliminary inquiry by a senior police officer and sanction by the competent authority for a accused to be arrested, has dealt a death blow to Act that was enacted with the objective of eradicating inherent discriminatory attitudes against SCs and STs. Experts have also strongly objected to the court making punishable any violation of its directives of a preliminary enquiry and prior sanction for pursuing against an accused under the Act.  With many of the cases of atrocities under the Act either going unreported or the investigators reluctant to pursue with the case, the court’s diktats will only lead to further rise in the malaise. The court verdict has come at a time when the country under the Modi regime has been witnessing a spate of caste related violence.  The rise in incidents of violence against Dalits led to the government in January 2016 introduce amendments in the SC/ST Act whereby new offences of atrocities like tonsuring of head, moustache, garlanding with chappals, dispose or carry human or animal carcasses, etc were introduced.  Besides adding a chapter on the ‘Rights of Victims and Witnesses’, the amendment Act also provides for establishing “Exclusive Special Courts’ to ensure speedy and expeditious disposal of cases.  While reflecting on the abuse of the Act, many say the Bench ought to have reflected on the series of incidents where Dalits have been subjected to violence and discrimination. The latest: a man from Hathras (Uttar Pradesh), who has been writing to various authorities for months to seek help for taking out his marriage procession through a village dominated by upper castes. Just days ahead of the Apex court verdict, the man,  , moved the Allahabad High Court with his plea.  The verdict has created ripples within the centre’s ruling National Democratic Alliance. A section of Parliamentarians with SC/ST background from the BJP and ally Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) of Ram Vilas Paswan held talks with Prime Minister Modi, Union Social Justice Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot and wrote to Prasad.

However, Opposition parties in the state are crying foul. They are asking why hasn't the State Election Commission given parties at least 45 days for campaigning. The BJP is planning to move the court in this matter. West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said, “We met State Election Commissioner Amarendra Kumar Singh two day back and urged him to give at least 45 days’ time for campaigning. But we have received only 30 days. Moreover higher secondary school examination are yet to be finished and so it will be difficult to carry out campaigning by using microphones.

Also, the State Election Commissioner did not mention whether they will deploy Central forces during elections or not.” Another issue that the Opposition is raising is that there is no uniformity in the number of districts that will be voting in each phase. While 12 districts are going to the polls on 1 May, only two districts will vote in the second phase. Congress leader Manoj Chakraborty said, “We have demanded that Central forces should be deployed in the Panchayat election. We feel that there is some conspiracy regarding distribution of districts that are going to the polls for the first and second phase. Why are only two districts going to the polls in the second phase and 12 big districts in the first phase?"" On 1 May, polling will be held at the districts of Nadia, North 24 Pargana, South 24 Pargana, Howrah, Hooghly, East Midnapore, West Midnapore, West Burdwan, East Burdwan , Purulia, Bankura and Jhargram. On 3 May, elections will be held at Murshidabad and Birbhum. On 5 May, there will be polling in Coochbehar, Alipurduar , Uttar Dinajpur, Dakhsin Dinajpur, Malda and Jalpaiguri. The SEC says that 3 lakh state government officers will be deployed for the elections. Regarding the deployment of central forces, West Bengal Election Commissioner Amarendra Kumar Singh said” We are yet to decide on whether there will be deployment of Central forces during the Panchayat election”.

383,Aditya Menon,"The violence began in West Bengal's Purulia district on Sunday, when local Hindu Right wing groups took out armed processions across the city on the occasion of Ram Navami. This was in violation of the administrations orders that arms were not to be carried during the processions. Despite this, the organisers not only went ahead with the processions but also made it a point to go through Muslim dominated areas in Purulia. On Monday, a similar pattern of violence took place in Raniganj in Asansol district after Hindutva outfits took out armed processions in the city, playing provocative songs. According to locals, migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh formed a majority of those in the processions. Union Minister and Member of Parliament from Asansol Babul Supriyo was scheduled to be part of the central Akhara which, along with different Akhara committees, had organised this procession. Despite the police's orders, the Hindutva outfits went ahead and took the armed processions through the neighborhood of Rajban where Muslims were celebrating the Urs of a Sufi saint. Locals say that provocative songs targetting Muslims were played during the procession. One of the songs said: Violence is said to have begun after one of groups began pelting stones. In the rioting that followed, 8-10 shops belonging to Muslim business owners were burnt. This included Taj Shoes, Haq General Stores and a prominent crockery store owned by a Muslim. The rioting also extended to a government run haat where mostly Muslim vendors sold fresh produce. Similar processions were carried out in West Bengal's Siliguri, North 24 Parganas and other districts as well. In Kankinara in North 24 Parganas, right wing goons destroyed a statue of freedom fighter Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. In Kolkata, BJP workers reportedly attacked a police officer who tried to prevent them from taking out an armed procession. In Bihar, the violence began with a minor clash in Siwan on Sunday but by Monday, the clashes had intensified and spread to Aurangabad and then to Munger and Samastipur districts. Minor clashes also took place in Kaimur and Gaya. Even in Bihar, there have been reports of violence after Hindu Right Wing outfits taking out armed processions through Muslim neighbourhoods during the immersion of Chaitri Durga. In many cases, the processions were in violation of the orders from the local administration. Like West Bengal, there are reports of provocative, anti-Muslim songs being played in the processions in Bihar as well. For instance in Munger, the procession was taken out through Muslim majority areas like Kaali Tazia Dilawarpur, Mir Ghyas Chowk and Topkhana Bazaar. But also through mixed commercial areas like Neelam Chowk and Bata Chowk. The same anti-Muslim song played in Asansol - 'Topi wala bhi sar jhuka ke Jai Shri Ram bolega', was played in Munger as well. In Bihar's Aurangabad district, processions were taken through Muslim neigbourhoods despite the administration imposing Section 144 in these areas. In the ensuing rioting around 30 shops belonging to Muslims were gutted and a local Muslim ambulance driver, Naeem, was shot in police firing. He is presently undergoing treatment in Patna.. On 17 March 17, there was communal violence in Bihar's Bhagalpur district after Arijit Shashwat son of Union Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey took out an armed rally shouting provocative slogans through multiple Muslim neighbourhoods. Communal polarisation in Bihar has increased since the BJP-JD(U) alliance assumed power in July 2017. Since January 2018, communal tensions have affected several districts of Bihar including Gaya, Arrah, Champaran, Muzaffarpur and Vaishali, especially during festivals. In 2017, there were 85 incidents of communal violence in Bihar that left three persons dead and 321 injured, while in West Bengal, there were 58 incidents that left nine persons dead and 230 injured. In Telangana's Nirmal district, some people present in the Ram Navami procession organised by a Hindutva outfit, targetted a local mosque. According to  , ""A pro-Hindutva outfit took out a procession on Ram Navami. The procession, which started at Devarakota temple, almost reached its end point in Gulzar Mosque market without incident, when suddenly a group of people began pelting stones at the mosque"". Speaking to The News Minute, District Superintendent of Police Vishnu S Warrier has confirmed that those who attacked the mosque were part of the procession. Some glass panes in the mosque got damaged and a saffron flag was reportedly thrown inside. On hearing of the mosque being attacked, Muslim community members gathered near it and staged a protest demanding justice. A clash soon erupted between the two sides, in which five persons were injured. In a separate incident, two cases have been filed against BJP MLA from Goshamahal in Hyderabad, T Raja Singh, for making provocative speeches on Ram Navami. A video has gone viral in which Singh can be seen threatening to ""rewrite the history of Telangana"" if the administration disallows loundspeakers on Ram Navami. A case has been registered against Singh under Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code which deals with ""Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs"".  An attempt was made to create a communal polarisation in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. In Rajasthan's Jodhpur, Hindutva outfits took out a tableux glorifying Shambhu Lal Regar, who hacked an elderly Muslim labourer Mohammad Afrazul to death in the Rajsamand district of the state last year. In Agra in Uttar Pradesh, Hindu Yuva Vahini took out a procession with swords and other weapons. But communal tensions were averted due to the conscious efforts of the local Hindus and Muslims. In fact, Muslims in the city even came out and offered Sharbat to the people in procession, much to the surprise of Hindu outfits. Communal polarisation during Ram Navami, the emphasis on armed processions and the use of similar provocative songs and speeches are common threads that run through the violence in West Bengal, Bihar and Telangana. In addition to this, we have the alleged role played by figures associated with the BJP in the build-up to the violence: Babul Supriyo in West Bengal, Arijit Shashwat in Bihar and T Raja Singh in Telangana. These are extremely sinister signs. And with the verdict in the Babri Masjid case coming up, politics around Lord Ram is only going to intensify in the months to come.There seems to have been a clear attempt by Hindutva outfits to use Ram Navami processions to create communal tensions in at least three states in India: West Bengal, Bihar and Telangana. The pattern of the processions was eerily similar in all the states: large processions, in many cases armed, were carried out and made to pass through Muslim-dominated areas. Local administration's directives were violated, either in the carrying of arms or in the route passing through Muslim areas. Provocative, anti-Muslim songs were played. In all the three states violence began with stone pelting, either by people in the procession or those residing in the areas it was passing through.

384,Rajeev Khanna,"  's (BJP) national president   has replaced the party's Punjab unit chief Vijay Sampla with Rajya Sabha member Shwet Malik. The move continues to perplex political observers in the state because although Sampla's removal was on the cards, the timing of the move raises a lot of questions. The removal came just a couple of days ahead of the 2 April Bharat Bandh call given by the Dalits and Sampla was the face of Dalit leadership of the BJP in Punjab. His removal at a time when Dalit politics is on the boil over the 'dilution' of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act by the Supreme Court. While BJP leaders close to Sampla are claiming that the announcement of his replacement has just coincided with the Dalit agitation, observers claim that there is much more to this. Sampla who is a BJP MP from Hoshiarpur and a minister of state in the  -led central government was brought in as the Punjab BJP chief in 2016 ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls that were held in February 2017. The move was aimed at making inroads into the large Dalit vote share as Dalits account for 32% of the Punjab population and this is the highest in terms of percentage in the country. But the polls had proved to be a loss making enterprise for the BJP as its tally fell from 12 in 2012 to a mere three seats in 2017. This indicated that the BJP's move to bring in a Dalit face at the helm had not paid off although Sampla's close allies claim that Shah was not expecting even a single seat in the assembly polls in Punjab. The party had deviated from its claim on the principle of one person one post to make Sampla the Punjab chief as he also held a Union portfolio side by side. Immediately after the Assembly polls Sampla's replacement looked imminent. His close confidants say that he had himself been asking Shah and other senior functionaries to relieve him of the charge but they had been delaying. “In any case holding a Union portfolio is far more important than being an organisational head of a state,” pointed a BJP functionary close to Sampla. Over the last one year there were rumour floated at regular intervals about his removal. And eventually the party decided to announce his replacement on March 31 by Malik who again is a surprise candidate. Sources say that Sampla never got along well with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), the BJP's alliance partner in Punjab. The two parties have been sticking together although there are a number of BJP workers who want their party to part ways with the Akalis. They believe that the party needs to test the waters in rural Punjab and contest more than the 23 of the 117 seats allocated by the Akalis to them in the Assembly polls. The party gets to contest three of the 13 seats in the Lok Sabha polls. Observers say that the alliance is expected to continue for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. There is a point of view that the BJP dumping a Dalit face for an Upper Caste like Malik at the time when Dalit politics is on the boil, may be an attempt to consolidate its traditional support base of upper caste Hindus, particularly in urban areas. This group had left the BJP for the Congress in the Assembly polls. This could have partly been due to demonetisation carried out by the Modi regime that had hit small traders, majority of whom are Hindus, very hard. Malik's elevation to the post is being questioned by many as he was never a heavy-weight politician. A former Mayor of Amritsar and a three time councilor, he had lost the 2012 local body polls. But his very close association with the RSS and also Union Finance Minister   is said to have ensured his entry to the Rajya Sabha in 2016 and now as state BJP chief. He had worked overtime in support of Jaitley in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls when the latter was contesting against the present chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh from Amritsar. Jaitley was trounced by Amarinder in the contest. Reports say that Malik’s father Rajinder Malik and brother Rajesh Malik have been a pracharak and sampark pramukh of the local wing of the RSS in Amritsar. For the BJP, the road ahead in Punjab is not easy as far as the 2019 Lok Sabha polls are concerned. Many attribute Sampla's removal and anointment of Malik at the top to the internal factionalism in the party's state unit. “The Congress culture pervades in the BJP also in Punjab,” pointed a political observer. The party only has one sitting Lok Sabha member from the state in Sampla. The other seat of Gurdaspur that was represented by  , was recently wrested by the Congress' Sunil Jakhar after it fell vacant because of Vinod Khanna's death in April last year. For the 2019 polls, the BJP will have to answer some tough questions on the decisions taken by the Modi regime, particularly on demonetisation and implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) especially in context on Langar (community kitchens) in Gurudwaras and several other issues. It remains to be seen how Malik takes the party forward in the days to come.  ",2018-04-04,," At a time when Dalits are angry, why did BJP remove its Dalit Punjab unit chief?  | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/at-a-time-when-dalits-are-angry-why-did-bjp-remove-its-dalit-punjab-unit-chief-106326.html
385,Akash Bisht,"Apart from MP (six deaths), the situation was particularly tense in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan (one death each). Widescale protests were reported from Punjab, Odisha and Jharkhand, affecting normal routine. There were demonstrations in Maharashtra too. Bahujan Samaj Party supremo   and Congress chief   came out in support of the Bandh. In Capital New Delhi, protestors were seen in small groups at several places, apart from bigger protests at Rajghat and Parliament Street, where his correspondent was present. Hundreds of protestors gathered at the road leading to the seat of Indian democracy to raise concerns over the alleged “ ” of the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. They demanded that the Supreme Court immediately revoke its order banning automatic arrests and registration of criminal cases under the Act. Those gathered squarely blamed the  -led Union government for delaying the process of filing a review petition. Under pressure, the Centre did file a plea in the apex court. However, Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra, refused an urgent hearing on a plea for stay and review of the court's previous ruling. Such was the anger among protestors that they forced Janak Chamar, a Dalit BJP Parliamentarian, to stop his speech midway and leave the venue. On stage, Chamar had only begun his introduction when protestors raised objections over his presence at the stage. Thereafter, KP Chaudhary, general secretary of All-India SC/ST Employee Federation, took the microphone and announced how the BJP is stonewalling Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar Azad's bail. The crowd then started booing the saffron party with slogans such as “BJP murdabad (Down with the BJP)”, “dalit virodhi sarkar murdabad (down with the anti-Dalit government)” and “Modi murdabad (down with Modi)”, leading to Chaudhary asking Chamar to leave.  The Gopalgunj MP was heckled by protestors and had to seek police protection. Once he left, several people from the crowd came forward to shake Chaudhary's hands who said all Dalit MPs of BJP should resign from Parliament over the dilution of the Act. “If they don't then you know that they are betraying us,” he said.  “The BJP wants to take us back to the dark ages from where Baba Saheb uplifted us. Do you think that we should do a gherao of Supreme Court? Will you support us?” he asked the crowd. On hearing this, the crowd erupted and started shouting “yes” amid chants of “Jai Bhim”.  Thereafter, Chaudhary announced that the 'gherao' of the topmost seat of Indian judiciary on 9 April, which was greeted with loud cheer. He stressed that similar to these protests, the SC gherao would also be done voluntarily without the support of any political party or banner. Veteran politician and former JD (U) MP Sharad Yadav then took over and blasted the BJP government for trying to dilute the SC/ST Act and sought reservations for dalits in judiciary as well. “Ever since the BJP came to power, it has tried to suppress Dalit voices while their followers have unleashed fury on innocents belonging to the community. Under the BJP, the Constitution is under grave threat,” the veteran leader said.  Speaking on the BJP's defeat in Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-polls in UP, Yadav said the coming together of two regional parties have shattered BJP's confidence. “All political parties and organisations should leave their differences aside and come together to dislodge this anti-Dalit BJP government... Use your vote wisely in the upcoming elections to keep Baba Saheb's legacy alive,” Yadav said.  Prodded by the crowd to raise the issue of malfunction of electronic voting machines, Yadav said EVMs should be scrapped and the use of ballot paper should be brought back to end all speculations. Once he finished his speech, the crowd began shouting SC/ST/OBC unity zindabad.  Thereafter, many speakers stressed on the need to vote BJP out of power to ensure a life of dignity for Dalits. Ashok Kumar, general secretary of All-India SC/ST Railway Association mentioned how the nation wide bandh was not led by any individual or political party and should continue as it is.  “The BJP government and other institutions have been trying to trample the Constitution and deny Dalits their rights. It is shocking that the SC passed such a judgement and what is even more shocking is how the government is delaying the process of filing a review petition,” he said.  The event was attended by a large number of youths from far-flung areas. Even they were extremely critical of the Prime Minister and repeatedly said his government was denying Dalits their rights.  “My request to the SC and the government is to restore the SC/ST Act. We have been facing so much discrimination that it was a nightmare for us to visit police station or tehsil. Because of this Act, the police and government employees were forced to take cognisance of our issues but if the SC remains adamant on its order, we won't be able to approach anyone. This will be a travesty of justice,” said Hanuman Prasad. The 28-year-old made a long journey from Tonk in Rajasthan to the Capital after hearing about the protests in Delhi. “Look how this government has failed to provide employment to crores of the youth in the country. What happened to all the promises of acche din. If these are the acche din than I don't want them,” he added.  Among others present were Ajay Dutt,   MLA from Delhi's Ambedkar Nagar, who claimed that dilution of the Act would lead to increase in atrocities against dalits across the country. “I request the SC to review its order so that Dalits are not denied their rights,” Dutt said.  A letter was also sent to the President by those at the forefront of the protests, requesting him to issue instructions to review the SC order.  “The BJP government and the institutions for the past few years are constantly attempting to destroy Social Justice that is guaranteed by the Constitution. Instances like Unna, Saharanpur are the evidences in front of us that how the respective governments and the courts are handling the matter. It is time for us to unite and fight against the Caste ridden institutions to ensure Justice, Liberty and Equality (sic),” read the letter.  Later in the day, Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi, on behalf of the RSS, said the SC's stand was unfortunate but the Sangh was wrongly being associated with that. Reportedly, BJP chief   called several ministers to discuss the issue.In an unprecedented show of solidarity thousands, may be lakhs, of activists who work for Dalit and Adivasi rights and supporters took to the streets in various cities across the country on Monday amid the call for an all-India shutdown. They were protesting the watering down of a central law to prevent atrocities against the underclasses by the Supreme Court. The demonstrations were not all peaceful. Media reports claimed at least eight protestors were killed, most of them in police firing, drawing sharp criticism from Opposition parties. Hundreds were reportedly injured or detained.

386,Akash Bisht,"  Continuing the process of overhauling its organisational structure, the Congress on Friday replaced Odisha's general secretary in charge BK Hariprasad with Jitendra Singh. Congress president   during his concluding speech at the party's plenary session in Delhi had promised to make major changes in the organisation stressing over the need to infuse young blood at the decision making level. It is for this reason that the party has chosen a younger Singh over Hariprasad to manage party's state unit which has been in shambles for long. It is no secret that Congress in Odisha is a divided house with many groups within the party squabbling over who gets to lead the state unit. This infighting has hurt the party so much that it has now yielded the opposition space to BJP which has made giant inroads in the state. So, it was not surprising that on the day when Singh assumed the charge, several senior leaders from Ganjam district resigned dealing yet another major blow to the party. Among those who resigned include former Union minister Chandra Sekhar Sahu, Odisha PCC secretary Bikram Kumar Panda and district Congress committee president Bhagaban Gantayat. In addition, five corporators from Berhampur municipal corporation also tendered their resignation. Without naming anyone, Sahu told media that they will join a party that has maintained secularism leading to speculations of them joining BJD. In fact, Sahu and Panda were recently made members of the AICC and had attended party's plenary session where Rahul had made a strong pitch for reviving the party. None of that seemed to have moved the Odisha leadership which has been at loggerheads with the central leadership over OPCC chief Prasad Harichandan's removal. In the past several months, senior leaders from the state have been making beeline in Delhi pleading Rahul to remove Harichandan from the post to end factionalism within the party. However, they have failed to persuade Rahul from taking the step which according to political analysts has consigned the Congress to a third spot in the state. Citing the party's performance in the the recently held Bijepur by-polls, these analysts believe that the Congress would suffer a similar fate in the 2019 Assembly elections and General elections. Even local leadership does not shy away from accepting how factionalism has hampered party's chances of making any sort of comeback in the near future. A senior Congress leader from the state claimed that Harichandan has not yet been removed because there is no leadership in the state. “In Odisha, everyone is a leader and since there is no genuine leadership it has made matters worse. However, there is no denying the fact that Harichandan needs to go but there needs to be a consensus which has been missing. If the decision is not made at the earliest, there is strong possibility of Congress leaders joining other political parties,” he said. Odisha based political analyst, Kedar Mishra, agreed and said that in the run up to polls, several other leaders will switch to BJD considering it is a natural choice for Congress leaders. “Congress' decision of sticking with Hariharan will decimate the party in the state. By sticking with Hariharan, the Congress is on a suicide mode and it won't be surprising if the party is completely wiped out in the coming elections. They have not been able to protect their old bastions like Koraput and Ganjam districts, so how can one expect them to do well in other parts,” he said. According to him, in the last years, the Congress has failed to organise any major programme, activity or protest leading to their party cadres becoming hopeless. “In these circumstances, it is obvious for them to join BJD considering it is in power and will come back to power in 2019 yet again. Nothing seems to be happening for Congress right now and it will continue to remain so even after 2019. Congress has lost the plot in the state and could have a similar fate as it has in Tripura where it secured on 2% vote share,” he added. Mishra argued that the changes made at the organisational level are less likely to bring any changes in the popularity of the party. He pointed how BJD and BJP have started booth level campaigning while Congress is still busy sorting the leadership crisis. “I will not be surprised if Congress' entire legislative party joins BJD or BJP. There is no logic as to why Rahul is fond of Harichandan who has no mass appeal. At a time when BJD is facing 19 years of anti-incumbency and Modi wave is on decline, Harchandan is not to be seen anywhere. He should have led from the front but that is certainly not happening,” he added. Meanwhile, NSUI leader Auro Prasad Mishra is hopeful that Singh being given the charge of the state will certainly help in reviving the party. He agreed that infighting and lack of funds is certainly hurting the party but is hopeful that Rahul would turn things around. “We need a better political strategy and our political management needs to improve. Moreover, deserving candidates should be given responsibilities,” he said. Auro is of the view that the party is not in the position to form government in 2019 and that it needs to work at the booth level to ensure a better performance in 2019. According to him, “Candidate selection remains the key and the senior leadership has to ensure that deserving candidate makes the cut. One must realise that we are fighting against parties that are not hesitating on investing crores for one seat. To counter that, we must be better prepared.” For Mishra, it is Congress' central leadership that should take all the blame. He mentioned how the party has not been able to build a single big movement against the government which is enjoying its free run in the state. “It seems that 2019 elections would be a bipolar one with BJD and BJP fighting to form the government. This will further weaken the Congress which will be advantage BJP on the longer run considering even BJD has not invested much in the next generation of leaders,” he claimed. Amid all this, these leaders and analysts believe that Singh's introduction to Odisha politics is a welcome move and will benefit party on the longer run. Singh had earlier been part of the three member committee which was dispatched to the state by Congress president to get a sense from state leaders. After detailed consultations with local leadership, Singh and others submitted their report to Rahul. There are strong possibilities of Harichandan being removed in the ongoing organisation reshuffle and names of Bhaktcharan Das and Niranjan Patnaik are doing the rounds. It is being speculated that Das, who is 11 years younger to Patnaik, could emerge as the party's consensual candidate to lead the state unit. Meanwhile, in other major organisational change, veteran leader and  's confidant Janardan Dwivedi was replaced by former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot as general secretary in-charge of organisation and training. The latter seemed to have made quite an impression on the newly elected president considering he was a constant feature of Rahul's entourage during his election campaign in Gujarat. Gehlot's elevation is also a sign of how Rahul has cemented Sachin Pilot's position in Rajasthan which goes to polls later this year. Pilot has been running an aggressive campaign in the state against BJP chief minister Vasundhara Raje and this will further strengthen his claim in the state. In other developments, Congress MP from Hingoli in Maharashtra, Rajeev Satav, has been appointed as the AICC in-charge of Gujarat while Lalji Desai was chosen as the chief organiser of Seva Dal in place of Mahendra Joshi. Rahul also appointed Yashomati Thakur as secretary and she will be assisting AICC general secretary and Karnataka in-charge KC Venugopal.  ",2018-04-02,, Congress is trying to overhaul its Odisha unit.

387,Charu Kartikeya,"Modi went on to reiterate the slogan in several subsequent speeches and it eventually became a part of the lexicon of all BJP leaders. The PM still stands by it and used it once again as recently as in February, in Parliament. Bhagwat's attempt to distance RSS from a slogan Modi holds dear is therefore a significant moment. It indicates, at the very least, that RSS and the BJP are not on the same page in terms of a key political strategy. The slogan has always been slammed by political leaders as well as analysts, because it betrays an unusually vindictive campaign. India's political arena is a hotly-contested space, with three dozen parties represented in the Lok Sabha. Many more exist at local levels and many others are registered with the Election Commission, fighting for recognition and space. Parties vie with each other, criticise, attack and try to demolish each other's campaigns. However, seldom do they wish for the annihilation of the rival. Most of them realise that the existence of a rival fuels their own existence and spread. Non-Congressism is an old concept but even that campaign did not call for the end of the Congress party. The Congress too has never expressed a desire to see the end of a rival party. This was possibly the first time that an openly exclusionist campaign was carried out. Notably, RSS didn't intervene so far and has decided to speak at a time only when several indications of a weakening of the BJP's and Modi's grasp on the national consciousness since 2014 are appearing. The BJP lost three critical Lok Sabha bye-polls; the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) just lost one of its oldest constituents (Telugu Desham Party); another ally is breathing down its neck ( ) and two others are openly flirting with the Opposition (Lok Janashakti Party and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party). The government's failure in timely appealing for a review of the Supreme Court's order amending the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Cruelty) Act has led to massive protests against the BJP. The all-India shutdown called by several Dalit organisations created unprecedented pressure on the government. At an event connected with the bandh in New Delhi, a Dalit member of Parliament from the BJP was not allowed to speak and was hounded out of the venue. What could possibly be the motivation behind the RSS adding another pressure point on the BJP in such circumstances? Could it be that the RSS is smelling a decline in the fortunes of the BJP under Modi and is preparing for a post-Modi order? Only Bhagwat can clarify further.It has taken   (RSS) a full election cycle to distance itself from a slogan that has been at the core of the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) strategy right from 2013. Coming as it does at a time when the shadow of the next Lok Sabha polls is looming large, the timing of the latest statement by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat is pregnant with implications. Speaking at an event in Pune, Bhagwat reportedly said phrases like Congress-mukt Bharat are “political slogans” and are “ ”. He also elaborated that the slogan smacked of “political discrimination” and the Sangh never uses “the language of excluding anyone”. Bhagwat's pitch for political inclusion is likely to have been received with much surprise in the Sangh Parivar's own political circle. It was in 2013 that the BJP's then prime ministerial candidate   coined the slogan “Congress-mukt Bharat”. The Congress was the route of all evils in the country and therefore to uproot it was the need of the hour, he said at one of his election rallies, in Pune, in July 2013.",2018-04-02,, By distancing self from 'Congress-mukt Bharat' slogan is RSS preparing for a post-Modi order? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/by-distancing-self-from-congress-mukt-bharat-slogan-is-rss-preparing-for-a-post-modi-order-106016.html
388,Charu Kartikeya,"By Tuesday morning, newspapers, news television channels and news websites had already come out with sharp responses. An “emergency meeting” of journalists had been convened at the press club in Delhi to deliberate on the notification.  Soon, Irani indicated scope for review through two tweets, inviting “journalist body or organisation/s” to give suggestions to fight fake news and “uphold ethical journalism”. Within less than half an hour of those tweets, some journalists and media organisations broke the news about the withdrawal of the notification, on Twitter. Interestingly, these updates specifically mentioned the PM having called for withdrawal of the notification. There was no formal word from the PMO or any other government department that it was the PM, specifically, who wanted the order rescinded.   came out with a formal announcement only about an hour later, but even that release did not mention the PM. “PIB Press release titled “Guidelines for Accreditation of Journalists amended to regulate Fake News” issued on 2 April, 2018 stands withdrawn”, it merely stated. It appears that an attempt is being made to distance PM Modi from the controversy. Theses attempts suggest that Irani's ministry may have issued the controversial notification without the PM's consent and when the latter got wind of it, he quickly got it recalled. If that is indeed the case, that would be a first for this government which is said to have been always been in Modi's tight grip. Throughout the National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) four years in power, the government, its ministers as well as the ruling party have given the impression that PM maintains his watchful gaze on every move, every individual, every file and every noting in the government. Are we now being asked to believe that Modi's grasp on the government is loosening? Are Cabinet ministers now exercising autonomy and announcing measures without discussing them with Modi? Interestingly, it was way back on 17 March that Irani had first revealed the government's intention to take steps to regulate fake news. She had talked about only online content then, saying the Modi government was working on a “code of conduct” and possibly a legislation too. “Online is an ecosystem where legislation in terms of news, legislation in terms of broadcast content material, is not very clear. That is something that the ministry is currently undertaking, and in conversations with stakeholders”,  . In any case, Modi government's media strategy has been clear from a long time, wherein the PM will not interact with the press, his ministers and party spokespersons will face the press but will be dismissive of critical questions, media organisations will be controlled or nudged to take a pro-government and anti-opposition line and public service broadcasters will relentlessly air government propaganda.  The I&B Ministry's now-withdrawn order appears very much in sync with this strategy, even if fear of a backlash has made the government go back on it. It is the government, and not any particular minister, that stands exposed. The beast has bared its fangs once, it can do the same again and it might not withdraw them the next time. Free press has been put on notice.By withdrawing its controversial notification about fake news, the   government appears to have responded to the severe backlash it triggered. However, the way the withdrawal is being sold as a wise move by the prime minister smacks of a conspiracy to deflect some of the criticism aimed at the government.

One-to-one contact that AAP volunteers and supporters established made it strong at the grassroots. Before that, even in the 2014 General elections, hard work on the ground fetched the party four Lok Sabha seats from the party in the face of the Modi wave.

In the meeting Singh said volunteers were the backbone of the party and their opinion would be given utmost importance for appointments at every level. Also, AAP would work on maintaining discipline within the party and nobody would be allowed to cross the lines.  Four resolutions were passed unanimously, the primary one on AAP's resolve to fight drug dealers and their protectors. The party accused all its rivals – the  , Shiromani Akali Dal and   – of shielding those involved in the trade. The party demanded the state acts on a special task force (STF) report. AAP members also blamed the three rivals parties for continuing large-scale suicides by farmers and farm hands. The party criticised Amarinder for not uttering a word on the report submitted by a state Assembly committee on the issue, and demanded his government immediately releases compensation to the affected families.  Paying tributes to the 39 youngsters dead in Mosul, 27 of whom were Punjabis, AAP demanded compensation and jobs for their families. The party said successive governments were responsible for widespread unemployment that forces the youth to migrate to other countries despite threat to their lives.

It demanded the government mortgage properties of companies that cheated people and compensate affected families. Will these pay off?

390,Anurag Dey,"Subsequently, the BJP refuted Naidu’s charges and ridiculed him for his attempts to seek support from the Opposition. Taking strong exception to his allegations, senior BJP leader and Union minister   claimed the Union government went out of its way to help rebuild the bifurcated state.  “One should not be going to an extent to say that BJP is attacking Andhra Pradesh. We don’t even attack our erstwhile friends in unfriendly manner,” he said. “It is painful to hear him say that the TDP got at least 15 seats less (in 2014) because of its alliance with the BJP. If it was not for the Modi wave and the alliance with the BJP, wonder where the TDP would have been now. This is not the way to indulge in such a blame game,” he added. “  had already explained him about how the government has gone out of its way to help the state. From investment of Rs 1.4 lakh crore in the petroleum sector and Rs 70,000 crore on highways, to providing and fast-tracking clearances for building Amravati and the Polavaram irrigation project in the state,” Javadekar carried on, referring to Shah’s letter to Naidu. The BJP National President in his letter last month said the TDP quitting the NDA was “unfortunate” and refuted charges of his party being insensitive to Andhra's aspirations. In response, Naidu said Shah’s letter was “full of false information, which reflected their (BJP) attitude”. Reiterating the Centre’s commitment towards the development of Andhra Pradesh, Javadekar ridiculed Naidu’s politics. “All have the right to take a political stand, all can do politics , but please don’t pursue he politics of distrust. We (BJP-TDP) fought together against the Congress and now you are holding meetings with them. “It is painful to see the fallout but there should be a limit to political acrimony. All this blame game with political motive is rubbish. People will eventually realise who has done what. We have done everything for Andhra Pradesh and will continue to do,” Javadekar said. BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member GVL Narasimha Rao blamed the Congress for Andhra’s plight and warned against the possibility of the TDP aligning with the Congress. “The Congress is solely responsible for the plight of Andhra Pradesh. The state was bifurcated in a manner detrimental to Andhra region and taken without any consideration of the future of the state. “Who they ally with is their call and we have nothing to say. But if they go with the Congress, then Naidu will be perceived as a rank opportunist.

391,Rajeev Khanna,"The Vijay Rupani-led   (BJP) government in Gujarat is likely to face another Dalit upsurge, with the community deciding to intensify its movement for land rights. Dalits, tribals and the poor in Gujarat are largely alienated from land and the state government is under scrutiny for lack of policy implementation. A public meeting of representatives from various districts of Gujarat is been organised on 19 April at Dalit Shakti Kendra near Ahmedabad on the issue.  “The self-immolation of Bhanubhai Vankar in Patan was the manifestation of frustration that the marginalised sections of society has been going through after prolonged and unsuccessful struggle to establish their rights over land, especially Dalits,” Dalit activist Martin Macwan said. Due to illegal occupation, in many villages Dalits are yet to get possession of waste land that they were given by the government, activists alleged. Several government resolutions have underlined that despite instructions district revenue authorities are not serious about removing such encroachments.  The activists shared one such resolution from 5 October, 1990, according to which: “It has come to the notice of the state that the encroachments on the government land has been increasing with passing days. On asking for information on encroachment of such land by districts through GO letter of 8/4/1988, it has revealed that in many districts the more than 10% of land has been encroached upon.  “In four to five districts, such encroachment has been over 40% or more land. This is extremely painful which suggests that the local revenue authorities are not sensitive to their duty of protecting the government property and in some cases, they have been purposely overlooking such realities.” Other resolutions acknowledge the fact that while giving legal possession of land to members of the scheduled castes, revenue authorities do not care to check whether or not such allotted land is free from encroachment.  Macwan said there were many cases of the poor losing part of their land or not being able to locate their allotment and blamed new GPRS-based technoloy, which has replaced traditional manual land surveys.  Dalit activists pointed out that under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, in grievous cases (murder, forced migration etc) victims are to be given agricultural land; but the policy has not been implemented. There are increasing incidents of burial land being allotted to Dalits. Most complaints relate to local authorities alienating Dalits from their land on general observation for violations of grant conditions known as 'Sharatbhang'. Macwan disclosed that even when the state has not given the actual possession of the land, authorities take away the same land under the rule that the land given for the purpose has been violated. It is being pointed out that such issues faced by the marginalised have never been collated and addressed. Individuals trying to protect their land against well-organised campaign of the powerful elements to dispossess them ends only in despair. Corruption is another obstacle for the poor to protect the land. Activists claimed that a third of the atrocities on Dalits and tribals can be traced back to land. Legal cases have been awaiting disposal even after three decades and more. Applications by poor to get government waste land for agriculture in accordance with the state policy are addressed through holding 'Land Kacheri' (revenue courts). “This has not happened for many years in the state. In rural areas especially, there is enormous problem of getting housing plots but the same cannot be addresses as the state has failed to allocate land for housing even when it has land but such land is under encroachment. This process too has to happen in Land Kacheri,” Macwan said. The participants coming for the proposed public meeting understand that the tension around the land issue is the result of non-implementation of the state policy. They believe that while the state becomes a mute spectator to massive encroachment of government land, the tension is intense between various sections of the society. The activists have chalked out demands. They want the government to not dispossess them further for Sharatbhang until all pending alienation cases are resolved. They also seek that the state set up exclusive courts to deal with the land issue in order to resolve them in a time-bound manner. There is a need for the state to declare a time table of holding Land Kacheris to address the issue of granting land to the landless and allocate land for housing. It will be demanded that the state must hand over possession of land to tribal community and settle all disputes under the Forest Act in accordance with the agreed state policy. In addition to this, it must give agricultural land to victims from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes of grievous atrocities in accordance with the law. The Rupani government will have to tread a cautious path in dealing with the issue as it cannot afford to alienate both Dalits and tribals in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Together they account for more than 20 per cent of the Gujarat electorate.",2018-04-04,, Fresh headache for Rupani as Dalits plan to intensify land rights agitation | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/fresh-headache-for-rupani-as-dalits-plan-to-intensify-land-rights-agitation-106314.html

This response from the Union Minister comes a day after AAP convenor and Delhi Chief Minister   issued an apology to former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia for his ""drug trade"" remarks. The Union Minister further averred that the AAP had built their entire election campaign in Punjab around lies. ""This exposes cheap politics by AAP, they spread false propaganda.

Earlier in the day, Punjab AAP chief Bhagwant Mann resigned from the state president's post expressing his displeasure over the issue. Kejriwal had earlier accused Majithia of being allegedly involved in drug trade. Thereafter, Majithia reportedly filed a criminal defamation case in May 2016 against Kejriwal and AAP leaders Sanjay Singh and Ashish Khetan for falsely linking him to the drug trade and tarnishing his image. However, on Thursday, the AAP chief apologised in court for his ""unfounded allegations"" and announced the withdrawal of all his statements.

394,Rajeev Khanna,"  For the Aam Aadmi Party ( ), the sordid tale of total distrust, lack of cohesion and confidence between its Delhi and Punjab units continues. The party that had arrived on the scene ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls as an alternative to the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-  (BJP), today stands a pale shadow of itself. The latest episode of its national convener and Delhi Chief Minister   tendering a written apology to Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia for leveling drug trade allegations against him has placed the Punjab unit in a tight spot in public domain. The Punjab unit of the party and its local ally Lok Insaf Party (LIP) have condemned the move by Kejriwal saying that they were never consulted on the issue of tendering an apology on the issue. While the top leaders have tweeted their disagreement over Kejriwal's step, the state unit chief in Punjab who is also a Lok Sabha MP from Sangrur, Bhagwant Mann resigned from his post on Friday morning. The party's co-president in Punjab, Sunam MLA Aman Arora, also resigned from his post. The party MLAs along with those from the LIP held a series of meetings on Friday to chalk out their strategy. After the first meeting, Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly Sukhpal Singh Khaira said that Kejriwal has shown short-sightedness and signs of 'mental weakness' by surrendering before Majithia. “We have unanimously condemned the apology. Two days back our leaders had gone for a meeting with Punjab in-charge   and were not given any indication on this step. The apology is not in Punjab's interest and we will stand by the people of Punjab,” he said. Kejriwal's apology has led to a major loss of face and credibility crisis for the local leadership. What is being talked about and even Khaira mentioned in his briefing was the posters and banners that had come up in more than 13,000 villages of Punjab ahead of the Assembly polls last year where there was a picture of the local leaders asserting that Majithia was involved in drug trade and people were asked to call on the numbers of these leaders if they had any complaints to make with regards to the drug abuse. The party unit in Punjab has indeed become a laughing stock on the social media right from the time Kejriwal's apology went public and Majithia came out saying, “It is indeed a historical moment that a sitting chief minister has submitted a written apology in court withdrawing all statements he made against me besides regretting the damage caused to my esteem as well as hurt caused to my family, friends and well wishers. In today’s day and age we are bound to commit mistakes. It is human nature. Kejriwal has displayed great courage to admit his mistake and move on. I thank him for this gesture. However I want all politicians who seek votes on the basis of lies to realise what they are doing. This is not good for our society.” In Punjab the party had functioned as a two horse drawn unit right from the beginning where the horses were not running in tandem. First came the departure of senior leaders like Sumail Sidhu and Professor Manjit Singh along with that of those at the central level like Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav after the party had won four seats in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. AAP leadership even suspended two of these four MPs Dr Dharamvira Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa. They remain suspended till date even as their term comes to an end in a few months. The party got yet another jolt when the Punjab convener and party's Sikh face Succha Singh Chhotepur was shown the door following a sting operation that could not be substantiated. Chhotepur had accused leaders sent to Punjab from Delhi for conspiring against him. This was the time when the party was riding a high horse and was threatening to romp home victorious in the Assembly polls. The Punjab leadership had started raising its head accusing the central leadership of not consulting them on major issues including ticket distribution and not showing confidence in them. “Do they think that Punjabis cannot run the party in their state,” was a common refrain. The local cadres and leaders were never told about the party's chief ministerial candidate. The bickering between the state and central units also prevented the arrival of cricketer turned BJP politician   into the party The allegations of money changing hands in ticket distribution, lack of trust and frequent rebellions along with a section of leadership hobnobbing with hardline Sikh elements at the local level proved to be the nemesis of AAP in the polls. But the slide since then has not stopped. Soon after the Punjab elections, AAP's Punjab convenor Gurpreet “Ghuggi” Warraich quit the party. Changes in the top leadership at the state level and party in-charge have failed to stem the fall. For those who have quit the party in the process, Kejriwal's apology is nothing short of 'political suicide'. Meanwhile as the Akalis and Majithia bask in glory, the Congress leadership has once again found an opportunity to take potshots at AAP. Congress president Sunil Jakhar has come out saying that Kejriwal owes an apology to people of Punjab for not only misleading them but also cheating them. “Instead of tendering an apology to Bikram Majithia, you should have apologised to people of Punjab for consistently and continuously lying to them,” he said while pointing that Kejriwal’s apology to Majithia only establishes that AAP and SAD had a secret understanding to divide the anti-incumbency votes against the Akalis. “Their political posturing of criticising each other was only aimed at hoodwinking the people and dividing the anti-incumbency vote to benefit Akalis,” he added.  ",2018-03-16,, Kejriwal apologises to Majithia: AAP crisis result of tussle between Delhi & Punjab units | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/kejriwal-apologises-to-majithia-aap-crisis-result-of-tussle-between-delhi-punjab-units-103295.html

Chandrababu Naidu on Friday wrote a letter to party president   saying their ""expectations were not fulfilled by the Centre"". The TDP president in his letter said: ""The TDP joined the NDA with an expectation that Andhra people would get justice denied by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) during the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, but had decided to quit it after the TDP being in the alliance did not serve any purpose."" According to the Chief Minister, Andhra Pradesh now feels the BJP is insensitive to the aspirations of the people of the state. He said the central government headed by the BJP was ""not willing to implement the provisions in Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, and the assurances, including Special Category Status, given by the party in Rajya Sabha"". “The Centre has failed in discharging its constitutional responsibilities in implementing the Reorganisation Act,” Naidu told Shah in the letter. He further noted, ""The BJP and the TDP together fought the 2014 parliamentary elections as well as Andhra Pradesh and Telangana Legislative Assemblies, but the Centre ruling party after the elections ended the alliance in Telangana without even the courtesy of formally informing us.""

396,Charu Kartikeya,"AAP leaders said the move was aimed at saving precious time and limited resources that were being spent in dealing with the multiple legal cases in courts across the country. Kejriwal was just an activist when he caught the nation's fancy for his ability to point out wrong-doers without any inhibitions. He carried that approach into politics and launched attacks on politicians, political parties, bureaucrats and industrialists. This became his USP and possibly the biggest factor behind his quick transformation from activist to chief minister. In fact, in 2012, it was his audacity to openly level corruption charges against the man who is arguably the country's wealthiest and most powerful industrialist, Mukesh Ambani, that made many sit up and take notice of Kejriwal. In those says, he slammed Congress and BJP for corruption with equal brutality, leading many to believe that his politics will bring a break from the narrative carried forward by the mainstream parties for a long time. With this belief, the people of Delhi sent him to power not just once but twice and with a thumping majority the second time. This was the aura that got him over 2 lakh votes in the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi, which he eventually lost to the BJP's then prime ministerial candidate,  . As AAP rose in stature, Kejriwal became a threat for the status quo and thus began the campaign to corner him and his party. Between 2013, the year AAP first came to power in Delhi, and 2016, at least 10 defamation cases were filed against Kejriwal by a host of politicians in various courts in multiple cities. These include Majithia,  ,  , Pawan Khera, Ramesh Bidhuri, Amit Sibal and many others. These cases often require personal presence of the accused for hearings, besides regular maintenance of a team of lawyers. Majithia, for example, filed defamation cases against Kejriwal as well as other AAP leaders in courts in Ludhiana and Amritsar, requiring them to travel to Punjab often. AAP is still a small party with limited funds and can hardly afford to keep filling the bottomless pit that these legal cases have become. If apologies can ensure withdrawal of these cases, this will be in the party's best interest. This will also be a lesson for Kejriwal to design newer strategies that will take AAP ahead in the next leg of its journey. The party is already 5 years old, in power in one state, in opposition in another and has just debuted in the Rajya Sabha as well. The next Lok Sabha polls are just round the corner and AAP is not even figuring in the Congress party's designs to stitch up a coalition to take on the BJP. If AAP wants to become a part of the national discourse, it will have to pump up its game. Slander can not be its tool anymore. AAP will have to think of newer ways to evolve into AAP 2.0. Having said that, Kejriwal will have to remember that apologising to get the defamation cases shut must not mean adoption of silence against his opponents in Delhi, Punjab and elsewhere. AAP's Punjab unit is in a major fix now as it risks facing ridicule for chickening out. It is doing the right thing in protesting against Kejriwal's apology, in order to deflect allegations of diluting its stand in the fight against political patronage of the drug trade in the state. This protest will help AAP's Punjab leadership in conveying to the local electorate that it is still committed to that fight. Further, if any evidence comes up against any political leader in the future, AAP will have to take care not to ignore it and call for judicial action with utmost sincerity. convenor  's sudden decision to apologise to Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia may not have found support with the party's Punjab leadership, but the move suggests a sound strategy.

398,Catch Team,"In Jammu, the group visited the affected villages of Bera, Jeora Farm, Kapurpur on the IB (Pakistan calls it ‘Working Boundary’). It also visited the Suchetgarh Border Post on the Jammu-Sialkot Highway, following a flag meeting between Pakistan Rangers and the Indian Border Security Force.  The next day the group visited one of the villages on the LoC called Ganiah in Nowshera sub-division of Rajouri, which had witnessed frequent cross-border shelling. It also met villagers evacuated from some other villages adjoining the LoC – viz. Khamba (Jhanghar), Sair Makri, Kanet, Sarya and Anwas-Bhandar. The evacuated villagers met the group in a delegation led by the “LoC Border Migrants Committee” at Nowshera. The group also had discussions with prominent citizens of Jammu on the prevailing situation in the state. The group also made a visit to Uri and met people evacuated from the villages adjoining the LoC in the Haji Pir sector. These villages included Churanda, Hathlanga, Saura, Sillikot, Tillawadi, Balakot and Garkot. In Srinagar, the members of the group met Lt. General AK Bhatt, 15 Corps Commander, some prominent representatives of trade and business, a group of public intellectuals, and a member of the J&K Legislative Assembly. The CCG was shocked to see the devastation caused by the increased frequency and intensity of cross-border shelling. While the resilience of the border villagers who are collateral victims of the increased tension between the two countries is remarkable, it was shocking to find that no long-term strategies were being devised to alleviate their suffering. Even the short-term measures seemed ad hoc and patch-work at best.  The inhabitants of the border villages deserve to live in peace and security like their compatriots elsewhere in the country. However, they seem to have become itinerant migrants in their own country – evacuating their homes periodically to live in make-shift camps with their livelihoods disturbed by the deaths of their family members, losing limbs and getting wounded, their homes and hearths destroyed by the shelling, their cattle killed and maimed, and their children’s education disrupted.  These 'migrants' whether they are on the International Border or on the LoC have certain clear political views and equally clear messages for the two governments. They also have specific demands which need to be taken into account by those who take them for granted as routine victims of the hostility between India and Pakistan.  The CCG was also disconcerted to find that while the situation in the Kashmir Valley had deteriorated further, even the peace in Jammu had become fragile. It was concerned that Jammu was being communalised for narrow political gains by certain political groups and forces. In addition, the specific issues concerning the displaced community of Kashmiri Pandits as well as the refugees from West Pakistan who came to Jammu in 1947 were not being addressed adequately. The entire length of the IB and the LoC is fenced. However, intruders from Pakistan slip into India in connivance with Pakistani security forces either by cutting the fence, damaging the fence by firing or using fenced areas which get washed away by floods.  This time around the IB has seen greater shelling by Pakistan than earlier. Experts ascribe the intensity of firing to both calibre escalation – with larger calibre weapons being used – and revenge escalation. When India pounds Pakistan from LoC areas where it is better placed militarily, Pakistan retaliates from its advantageous positions on the border. Strategic Affairs experts claim that the Jammu border also becomes hot because Pakistan knows that the border villages around the IB and LoC segment in this region have a significant number of Hindu population – if they force the migration of Hindus from the border villages, it hurts the government in power politically. However, the prevalent view is that in most cases the damage caused to the border villages is collateral and most of the cross-border shelling is primarily aimed at the border posts of the two sides. Mortar shells are not precision-guided and it is the shells that go astray which hit the villages adjoining the border or the LoC.  Whatever be reasons for either side heating up the border or the kind of ammunition and weapons used, it is the villagers who live in the adjoining area who suffer. The villages abutting the IB in Ranbir Singh Pura (RS Pura) are almost used to mortar shells hitting their homes. There are any number of houses with walls pock-marked by shrapnel in these villages. In one such village, Bera, a young farmer had died while he had gone to his fields when a mortar shell hit him. The CCG members were also told that about 50 unexploded shells were still lying around in and around peoples’ homes – the Bomb Disposal Squad of the J&K police had not had the time to defuse them and remove them safely since January this year. The exchange of fire across the IB has been particularly severe in 2017-18. Locals say that the cross-border firing mostly used to take place in September-October every year and mostly at night. However, this year the firing has taken place in January also and during the day. Death can come to these villagers unannounced. Earlier, the villagers used to evacuate their homes at night and come back to tend to their farms and cattle in the morning. Now with day time firing from Pakistan, even that is not of much help. People can die while doing the most mundane things – during their morning ablutions, while praying, working in their fields or even just loitering in the streets. The cross-border firing has been so intense this January that many villagers complained that they could not even cremate their dead locally and had to take the bodies all the way to the Ranbir Singh Pura crematorium. In some other villages like Jeora Farm, which is barely 100 metres from the IB, while no villagers were killed, the death toll of cattle – buffalos, horses, sheep and goats – has been huge and economically crippling for the local Gujjars. In this predominantly Muslim village, most people rear animals and house them in thatched mud-walled cattle sheds. More than 200 cattle have been killed in the cross-border shelling over four days from 19 to 23 January 2018. In addition 24 thatched houses have been destroyed and 27 damaged. Since then, most villages spend the night in a make-shift camp at Chakroi at a safe distance from the border. They go back only during the day to look after their cattle.  There are two community bunkers in the village built by the state government. They are meant to shelter villagers during cross-border shelling. However, these are used only at night by 6-7 villagers who stay back to guard their property. The situation on the villages adjoining the LoC in the Jammu region is much worse. Unlike the villagers adjoining the IB villages, this area seems to have seen much more frequent cross-border firing. These villages have been subject to intermittent shelling in the months of March, May, June, July, August and December 2017. They were shelled once again quite intensely in January and February 2018. The group visited Nowshera, which accounts for a 68.5 km of the LoC. According to the district administration, 23 out of the 59 villages in the Nowshera sub-division are situated adjacent to the LoC. Since 2016, in Nowshera 12 of these villages with a population of about 13,100 have been severely affected by shelling from across the LoC.  The villages where there has been a loss of human lives and which have witnessed property and cattle damage are: Khamba, Sarya, Bhawani, Kalsian, Manpur, Dhanka, Bhojnava, Kalal, Khori, Ganiah, Pukharni and Anwas-Bhandar. Of these, four villages – Khamba, Bhawani, Sarya and Anwas Bhandar – are beyond the fencing on the LoC. The details of the damage suffered by these villages are considerable. There have been four deaths, eight villagers have been injured, 124 houses damaged, 189 livestock lost and 189 injured, three school buildings destroyed, one Panchayat house and one cattle shed destroyed due to shelling from Pakistan. Other collateral damage includes the destruction of water reservoirs and distribution system, transformers, electric poles, conductors, insulators, transmission lines and cables. Several heaps of stored grass have also been burnt. The villagers have been evacuated to make-shift camps being run in government schools at a safe distance. There are six such camps in Nowshera and an additional 44 camps have been kept ready in case the situation on the LoC deteriorated further.  The district administration has done an excellent job of providing basic facilities -- conveyance, boarding, proper accommodation, food and other essentials, medical care, potable water as well as uninterrupted water supply for other daily needs and sanitation for the displaced villagers. However, this clearly is not a permanent solution. The villages adjoining Uri had been peaceful for the last 8-10 years. However, this year Uri has seen several ceasefire violations. Truth is the first casualty on the LoC when ceasefire violations take place. Each side blames the other for starting the shelling. However, many local observers claim that the cross-border firing in Uri is a response to Pakistan’s shelling in Poonch, Rajouri and Ranbir Singh Pura. They surmise that the immediate provocation for the heavy exchange of fire across the LoC in Uri on February 20-24 was the killing of a Border Security Force trooper on 20 February in the Tangdhar area of Kupwara district by Pakistani firing. India is believed to be at a distinct military advantage on the LoC segment in Uri. According to local officials, no artillery was fired from the Pakistan side in the Haji Pir sector in Uri this time around, although artillery has been used by them in other areas on the LoC. The villages in this sector have been hit only by heavy mortar shells. The Indian Army, however, is believed to have used artillery to respond to Pakistan. Some of the villages adjoining the LoC, especially close to the Haji Pir nullah, are beyond the border fencing on the Indian side. These include Churanda, Hathlanga and Saura which are entirely beyond the border fence and others like Sillikot and Tillawadi lie on both sides of the fence. Most of the inhabitants of these villages are nomadic herders and their grazing ground lie inside the fence - ie towards Uri. The border fence is gated and these gates remain open during the day from 9 AM to 5 PM.  These people live under constant fear of becoming collateral victims of any exchange of fire on the LoC. Besides, the border fence is locked down during the shelling and this traps them in the direct line of fire. The gate in the fence itself is made a target by the Pakistan army during cross-border firing, making it impossible for anyone to open the gate and allow the villagers to move to safer areas. The distance between some of these villages on the Indian side and those on the Pakistan side is often as little as 20 metres.  In Uri, about eight villages housing about 7,000 people have been affected by the cross-LoC firing. About 1,500 people from these villages have been evacuated. While nearly half of them were put up in rehabilitation camps at four educational institutions in Uri and NHPC quarters in Kanderwan, the rest found shelter with their relatives in the area.  The CCG members met several villagers from the villages which have been evacuated frequently – in 1992, 1997 and then now in 2018. They claimed that this time around there were no casualties but that a woman had been injured due to shelling and about 30 houses in Churanda, 22 in Sillikot and 2 in Tillawadi had been damaged. A few animals have also been reportedly injured. However, a detailed assessment of property damage by the district administration was yet to take place due to the ongoing stray exchange of fire when the CCG members visited Uri. In the past, several people have lost their limbs in the shelling but fortunately that has not happened this time around. Most villagers have no complaints against the Army, dependent as they are on it for employment as porters, masons and casual workers. They are often also dependent on the Army for medical facilities and food supplies. Most of their land has been acquired by the Army for the construction of border posts and the acquired land adjacent to the ‘Zero Line’ on the LoC has been mined to prevent infiltration. The villagers claimed that up to 2009, they used to be paid rent for the land acquired by the Army but since then all rental payment has stopped. The district administration says that it has submitted plans to the state government for building 3,500 bunkers in the villages adjoining the LoC in the Uri sector. However, the situation of the villages beyond the border fence is such that building bunkers will not help them. They want land to build homes at a commuting distance from their villages so that they can cultivate their fields, tend their fruit trees and look after their cattle during the day. Most importantly, they want a permanent solution to stop the cross-LoC exchange of fire. When cross-border shelling starts intermittently, the local administration as a measure of abundant precaution shuts down schools in villages adjoining the International Border and the LoC. Often students get trapped in schools when shelling takes place and have to be rescued by special rescue teams. While this may be necessary to ensure the safety and security of the students, it jeopardises their education by disrupting it frequently.  Although the administration does run make-shift schools in the camps housing the villagers and their families, they are also impacted by the disturbed situation. The net result is that the students from the border villages do not do well in their school exams. In the Nowshera sub-division, for example, 71 schools falling within the 0-0.5 km range of the LoC have been shut down. In Uri too LoC village schools have been closed. The same is the case with schools in villages along the IB in Jammu. These children with frequently interrupted classes then find it difficult to compete with their peers who attend schools that run regularly and on a fixed academic schedule. The net result is that their parents then demand that their disadvantage of being from border villages be taken into account to give their children ‘grace marks’ to pass their exams. This obviously cannot be the long term solution to the problem of frequently disrupted classes and shifting schools. In case of death due to cross-border shelling, the locals get compensation of Rs 5 lakh each from the central and State governments and Rs 1 lakh from the Red Cross. The family of the diseased has the choice of not accepting monetary compensation and opting instead for a government job for the next of kin of the dead under the state government’s Special Rehabilitation Order (SRO). For those who are wounded, the maximum compensation is Rs 75,000 per person with the minimum being Rs 5,000. After the visit of a team from the Union Home Ministry in November 2017 to J&K, the compensation rates were revised under the State Disaster Response Fund or SDRF. These rules have been applicable since December 2017. According to the revised scheme; the compensation for animals killed is fixed based on the type of animal eg Milch Buffaloes are compensated at Rs 30,000 each, the other – non-milch, at Rs 25,000 each, goat at Rs 3,000 each, sheep at Rs 4,000-6,000, and chicken at Rs 80 each.  There is no limit set for the compensation and individuals can get compensation for each animal/bird killed. The group met a villager who had lost 15 buffalos in the shelling overnight at Jeora Farm who claimed that a buffalo costs between Rs 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh in the market. Even if this is an exaggerated estimate, his compensation of Rs 30,000/per animal is unlikely to put him on the path of economic recovery. The primary demand of the villagers in the border is that India and Pakistan should resolve this issue through an immediate dialogue.  Time and time again the villagers told the group that “either resolve this through dialogue or through a decisive war which settles the issue once and for all (‘aar-paar ki ladai’).” This is not a call for war but a reflection of their desperation and helplessness where they become involuntary victims of the conflict between the two countries.  There are mature voices also among the residents of these border villages. Many believe that war is no option. “Don’t give ‘munh-tod jawab’ (jaw-breaking reply) to Pakistan from here because then we, who live on the border, are the sufferers. Give a tough reply from Delhi or Mumbai,” one of them said. Another said: “We think that the solution to this problem is ceasefire. India and Pakistan should come to an understanding on maintaining peace on the LoC as they had done earlier. That worked for a decade or more. But for that they have to sit across the table as in today’s day and age it is impossible for either side to capture and hold onto the territory of the other. Stop tough talk with mortar shelling, talk to each other.” However, their immediate demands can be summarised as follows: People in Jammu felt that the exchange of fire on the IB and the LoC should not be seen as localised activity and emphasised that it had wider ramifications for the state. When violence erupts in the Valley, Jammu does not remain untouched and the reverse can also be true. The wider contours of the India-Pakistan conflict, they said, had started impacting individual thinking and perceptions besides the direct impact it has in the border areas. There was a general consensus that when no dialogue seemed possible between India and Pakistan, civil society organisations had a role in taking initiatives to address the issues confronting the people and mere Pakistan-bashing was not going to help. More importantly, there was perception among the local citizens that in the coming days the situation in Jammu was likely to become difficult to handle. The growing disappointment with the state government and increasing communal divide could make the situation in Jammu quite provocative. The Kashmir Valley has been on the boil off and on but the Jammu region becoming politically volatile is a new phenomenon. The religious divide in the state has clearly been deepened in recent years as communalism has taken deep roots. People point out that even the Courts in Jammu and Kashmir are divided – the two benches in Jammu and Srinagar gave differing rulings on unfurling of the state flag, for example. This has caused fissures in the state’s social stability.  The latest issue that has flagged the rise in communalism in Jammu is the brutal rape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim Bakkarwal girl, Asifa, in Kathua allegedly by a Hindu. The attempt apparently was to frighten and evict the nomadic Bakkarwals from the land they occupied. Some local leaders of the   (BJP) along with an outfit called the Hindu Ekta Manch have taken out public rallies with the tricolour in hand shouting slogans which suggest that Muslims are pro-Pakistan and need to be dealt with swiftly. A prominent local Muslim businessman summed up how he felt saying, “I belong to Jammu and have never felt unsafe here. But now even I have started feeling insecure. What am I to make out of the Hindu Ekta Manch taking out a protest march waving the national flag over the Asifa rape case shouting: “Those who want Pakistan will be sent to Qabristan (burial ground)? The only person who needs to be sent to Qabristan is the rapist. Even in the case of a rape, we are totally divided. This is frightening.” The communal divide in Jammu is being promoted by politically ambitious leaders who are intent on tearing apart the rich and diverse social fabric of the region for their short-term political benefits. Some prominent citizens, however, lamented the fact that local civil society organisations had not countered the communal narrative surrounding Asifa’s rape and murder. Others said that there was no civil society in Jammu and that the space for civil society’s activities had been taken over by communal politicians. Not only is Jammu getting polarised communally, even the State Legislative Assembly has been polarised after the terrorist attack on the Sunjuwan army camp. Increasingly the perception is that there is a ‘Hindu Jammu’ ruled by the BJP and then there is ‘Muslim Kashmir’ ruled by the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) – i.e. there is a communal division of labour between the two political allies which govern the state. Many believe that the PDP-BJP government thrives on communal divisions by promoting polarising voices to represent the sentiment in Jammu and in the Valley. This divides and alienates people. This was described as ‘soft separatism’ by a public intellectual. Many felt that there was a need to contest the separatist narrative or even a communal ‘Jammu narrative’. It was suggested that a beginning could be made not only by civil society demanding justice in the Asifa rape case but also through institutional means such as focussing on school education -- including lessons about local heroes in school curriculum and making school prayers and activities inclusive.  There was local resentment that the central government seemed focussed only on the Valley because of the separatism there and ignored Jammu. The growth in Jammu had become hostage to the concerns about the Valley, they claimed. There were complaints that projects that should have rightfully come to Jammu are implemented in the Valley because the militants there had picked up arms. Whatever be the truth about the causes of resentment in Jammu, what was clear was that the central government needed to pay attention and balance the demands of the people from all the regions of the state – Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. The Kashmiri Pandits would like to go back to the Valley but have no homes to go back to as their homes are either sold or badly damaged. Although the Kashmiri leaders know these facts; they insist that Kashmiri Pandits must go back to their original homes. As a result their issue remains stalemated. Kashmiri Pandits who had gone back to the Valley after taking up government jobs under Prime Minister’s Employment Scheme apparently were under pressure, not from the locals, but from their kin in Jammu to return.  However, were there to be second migration of these Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley, the crisis in the state may become even more intractable. It would seem that Kashimiri Pandit politics has become quite complicated and there was a need to understand how their issues could be resolved through amicable political methods. The representatives of the West Pakistan refugees argued that there was an urgent need to address their issues too. They are not ‘state subjects’ and are therefore denied certain rights that other inhabitants of the state enjoy. They cannot get employment with the state government, they cannot buy or own property and their children cannot get government scholarships.  Although they have been given limited rights to access education and health facilities, they essentially remain lesser citizens of the state. Their problems seem so intractable within the framework of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status within the Indian Constitution that no government has addressed them with any seriousness. There was unanimity on arriving at a consensus for resolving problems afflicting Jammu and the need to find a set of actionable issues on which there was a general consensus. On its part, CCG offered its services to civil society organisations in Jammu for extended discussions on the issues affecting the people and to identify the way forward. There was growing feeling in the Valley that politics had not worked in the state and that ceasefire or the lack of it made no difference. The hopes of the Kashmiris in Prime Minister   seemed to have been dashed. They had thought that he would carry forward the initiatives of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. However, now they felt that he has brought nothing but despair and disappointment in Kashmir.  As a result, the constituency for peace and peace-building through confidence-building measures (CBMs), elections and dialogue, has been eroded. Now even to suggest the use of these instrumentalities for peace is to invite derision. Despite its earlier enthusiasm, the local citizenry does not now place much faith in the frequent forays of the Home Ministry’s special interlocutor to the state.  In effect, the Modi government’s policies have pulled the rug from under the feet of those who did not support militancy, violence and radicalisation. It is this all-prevailing desperation that has given rise to militancy and people accepting the use of violence by youngsters. In South Kashmir the perception is that every youngster is a militant – the only difference is that some are armed and others unarmed. Militancy has also now spread to Srinagar. As for the Modi government’s Kashmir policy, there is a feeling that since it is unable to control terrorism, it wants its constituency to feel that India is effectively replying to Pakistan which is projected as the root cause of all problems in Kashmir. Under these circumstances the locals have internalised the fact that while violence in Kashmir will wax and wane, politically nothing will happen to address their concerns. What also seems to have added to the despair of Kashmiris is that they see little support from the Indian mainstream intellectuals and opinion makers. Even those who were never influenced by Pakistan see little hope when they look towards Delhi. The net result is that the social base for a robust relationship with rest of India has shrunk. This has also impacted the younger generation as they do not view any dialogue with Delhi with any element of hope. The younger generation of Kashmiris does not have the context of normal situation as they have not seen normalcy in their lives. Those who have seen militancy in the late 1980s and in the 1990s seem more worried today. Almost every youngster in the age group of 13 to 24 seems to be inspired by militant thought even if most of them are not picking up arms as yet.  This inspiration is not coming from Pakistan or its intelligence agencies but from local militant youth icons like the late Burhan Wani and now, Zakir Musa. Unlike in the past there is no moderating influence of parents, other family elders or religious leaders on them. As the state government is increasingly being seen as an extension of the regime in Delhi, a situation may come when the only link of the state to the rest of India would be through the security forces. At the end of its fourth visit to the state, the members of the CCG have come to the following conclusions: Yashwant Sinha      Kapil Kak      Bharat Bhushan    Sushobha BarveIn view of the rise in cross-border firing between India and Pakistan on the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB) in Jammu and Kashmir, the Concerned Citizens’ Group (CCG) decided to visit some of the affected area and also hold discussions with prominent opinion makers in Jammu and in Srinagar.  The Group comprised Yashwant Sinha (former Union minister for finance and external affairs), Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Kapil Kak, Sushobha Barve (executive secretary, Centre for Dialogue and Reconciliation) and Bharat Bhushan (journalist). Wajahat Habibullah was unable to join due to pressing personal commitments. Yashwant Sinha was unable to accompany the group to Srinagar and Uri. The primary rationale of the visit was the escalation of cross-border shelling which assumed a new intensity since the beginning of this year. The ceasefire understanding reached between the two countries in 2003 was violated with impunity with small arms fire giving way to heavy mortar and finally, even artillery.  The unusual escalation resulted in a high death toll – the casualties in January 2018 alone equalled the figure for the entire 2017. And 2017 itself was an exceptional year for ceasefire violations, as they represented a six-fold increase compared to 2015.  The huge collateral damage to civilians living on both sides of the border was therefore also not unsurprising. On the Indian side alone more than 40,000 civilians had to be evacuated, make-shift camps set up to house them at a safe distance, economic activities disrupted and schools closed in the areas adjoining the IB/LoC. Besides the loss of human lives, houses were destroyed and damaged, cattle killed and injured and local water and electricity infrastructure disrupted. The group believed that the situation in Jammu, fast deteriorating into a communal divide, also needed to be looked at. The rape and brutal murder of an eight-year-old Muslim Bakkarwal girl, Asifa, was being used to fan communal passions by local politicians. Within the Kashmir Valley, despite the success of the security forces in eliminating top militant leaders, the recruitment to the militant ranks was on the rise with even highly educated youngsters choosing to pick up the gun. Militancy in the Valley also seemed to be changing qualitatively with fidayeen attacks taking place. Suicide attacks were unknown in the Kashmir Valley earlier. People have been making a connection between the heating up of the LoC and terrorist attacks in the state by terrorist proxies of the Pakistan Army. The argument goes that by using terrorist proxies, the Pakistan Army distances itself from terrorist attacks and pays no price for its subterfuge. The ‘robust’ response of the Indian Army this time around, it is said, is meant to punish the other side by specifically targeting Pakistani Army posts. Militancy in the Valley, however, also seems to have developed an autonomous raison d’etre in the absence of any political dialogue. The group wanted to understand the changes that had taken place in the Valley since its last visit and understand whether there were any moderating influences that could prevent youngsters from taking up the gun.",2018-03-16,," India, Pak must talk to revive ceasefire for peace in Kashmir | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/india-pak-must-talk-to-revive-ceasefire-for-peace-in-kashmir-103279.html
399,Rajeev Khanna,"After Aam Aadmi Party national convenor  's apologising to Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Majithia for calling him a drug dealer, everyone in Punjab appears to be discussing whether this is the end of the road for   in the state. While it may be too early to write an epitaph for the party at this point of time but the damage that has been done to its Punjab unit has gone a bit too far. On Friday, AAP lost its ally the Lok Insaf Party (LIP) that has walked out of the alliance over the tendering of the apology by Kejriwal. While this departure hardly makes any difference in terms of the structure of the present state assembly, it carries a lot of symbolic significance. When AAP went in for an alliance with this party led by highly vocal and aggressive Bains brothers (Balwinder Singh and Simarjeet Singh), it was a major departure from its stand since its inception in 2012. This was for the first time ever that it had gone in for a pre-poll alliance out of political compulsions as it was smelling a victory in the Assembly polls. It's former convener Gurpreet Singh Waraich aka Ghuggi had said, ""Our Constitution does not forbid an alliance. It says that tickets cannot be given to two members of a family. If this hindrance was not there, there could have been a merger of LIP with AAP"". Now that alliance stands broken. The more important aspect is that while the Punjab unit of the party has rebelled against the Delhi leadership, it stands just short of going independent for which they will have to opt for a name change with support from two thirds as per the constitutional provisions. This is a strong possibility as the things stand. This would simply translate into the fact that there would be nothing like original AAP in Punjab if this happens. There are reports in the media saying that it was a few MLAs that are still strongly with the Delhi unit who put a spanner in the move for the AAP MLAs moving out on Friday. For the time being, it has been decided that none of the AAP leaders will go to Delhi for meetings but it will be the Delhi leadership that would have to come to Punjab. This hardly carries any weight in the face of the loss of credibility that the Punjab leadership is facing. Same is the case with the resignations tendered by the Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann and Sunam MLA Aman Arora as president and co-president of the Punjab unit. The Akalis who are sitting smug following the chaos in the AAP ranks after Majithia scored a major goal by drawing the apology, are now adding fuel to fire with their statements. The SAD has asked both Mann and Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Khaira to resign from the primary membership of AAP as well as the Lok Sabha and state assembly respectively and seek a fresh mandate. Party leader Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said, “If both Mann and Khaira feel differently now and are truly not with the AAP Convener they should resign from parliament and the state assembly immediately because they got votes in the name of Kejriwal.” The Congress has also been unsparing in taking a dig at both Kejriwal and AAP. Punjab Congress vice president Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa has asked Kejriwal what was the haste and hurry in beating such a 'shameful retreat', when the investigations are going on and the court is yet to pronounce its judgment. At the same time, Randhawa reiterated his allegations against Majithia saying that Kejriwal’s apology does not exonerate him of the crime of patronising and promoting drug trade in Punjab and he already stood guilty in people’s court. Asserting that there was a nexus between the AAP and the Akalis, the Punjab Congress Committee vice president pointed out the apology was deliberately tendered on the same day when the Special Task Force (STF) constituted by the Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had submitted its report to the Punjab and Haryana High Court saying there was evidence on the basis of which Majithia should be investigated. This, he said, was done to divert the public attention from the report. “I don’t know if Kejriwal is scared or he has taken money. But he has definitely back-stabbed the people of Punjab,” Randhawa said. AAP's supporters and volunteers in the state are very annoyed with Kejriwal's decision . They are pointing that such a strategy in defamation cases can halt the expansion of the party's base. They are accusing him of letting them down saying that they blindly followed him and carried out tasks for AAP at the cost of their personal benefits. They are pointing to candidates like Himmat Singh Shergill who had dropped a comfortable seat like Mohali where he had chances of winning easily to go and contest against Majithia just to drive home the party's resolve on fighting drug menace. The party's performance since the Assembly polls has been pathetic. It fared very poorly in the recent Gurdaspur Lok Sabha by-poll where its candidate forfeited his deposit and most alarming was the massive fall in the vote share in comparison to the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. The party could poll only around 23,000 voes while it had polled around 1,73,000 votes in 2014 polls. The party fared poorly in the local body polls including the recent Ludhiana Municipal Corporation polls where it could win only one seat. The trend does not offer a rosy picture and the tendering of apology has just added to the woes of AAP. The party that had once promised to be a third alternative in Punjab politics today stares at the possibility of losing its existence.",2018-03-17,," After Kejriwal's apology, is it the end of the road for AAP in Punjab?  | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/after-kejriwal-s-apology-is-it-the-end-of-the-road-for-aap-in-punjab-103394.html
400,Akash Bisht,"On the last day of Congress’ 84th plenary session, party president   gave a sneak peek into the roadmap that will help in building a stronger and more vibrant Congress to take on Prime Minister   in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Promising to deliver on the plenary’s theme of ‘Change is Here’, Rahul gave impetus on giving prominence to ordinary workers over veteran leaders to create a more robust Congress.  Speaking during the concluding session of the two-day plenary, the Congress president claimed that there existed a wall between the grassroots-level workers and senior leadership and that his motive was to demolish that wall to ensure representation of ordinary workers in the party. “We have to change the Congress. There is a wall between our leaders and workers. My first task will be to break that wall. I will consult senior leaders to destroy that wall with love,” he said.  His remarks were greeted by a thunderous applause and loud slogans of ‘Rahul Gandhi zindabad’ from the audience who had gathered in the national capital for the two-day event. In fact, this plenary was a complete departure from its previous avatars where senior leaders were seated on the dais. This time around the dais was left empty with all senior Congress leaders seated with the other delegates only separated by barricades. “Do you know why this stage has been left empty? It is because I want to see ordinary party workers to rise and take their place on this stage. In the past, we had leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru, Sardar Patel and Subhash Chandra Bose. I want to create that Congress of the past where anyone can lead the party,” he added.  Moreover, what made this plenary stand out from the rest was how a lot of young leaders were given a chance to speak at the forum which was refreshing to see. In the past, senior leadership hogged all the limelight while young leaders were confined to the sidelines.  Citing example of the recently held Gujarat Assembly elections, Rahul pointed how involving Congress workers paid huge dividends. “When we gave tickets to Congress workers in Gujarat, Modiji was seen flying away in seaplane. When we truly empower Congress workers, PM Modi will be seen in submarine,” he added.  Meanwhile, during his 53-minute long speech, Rahul devoted most of his time making stinging attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP and the RSS. In a veiled attack on BJP President  , Rahul said, “People will accept a man accused of murder as the president of the party, but they will never ever accept the same in the Congress party because they hold Congress in the highest regard.” The 47-year-old was particularly critical of the Modi government and likened the prevailing political situation in the country to Mahabharata. Comparing BJP and RSS to Kauravas and Congress to Pandavas, he said, “Centuries ago there was a huge battle on the field of Kurukshetra. The Kauravas were powerful and arrogant. The Pandavas were humble and fought for the truth. Like Kauravs, BJP is designed to fight for power, but like the Pandavs Congress will fight for the truth.""  Labelling the Modi government as corrupt, the Gandhi scion said the people of the country hold Congress to a higher standard while the ruling dispensation is corrupt and controls the conversation in the country. Accusing Modi of colluding with crony capitalists, Gandhi cited examples of Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi and said “so what does Modi actually mean? It symbolises the collusion between India's biggest crony capitalists & PM. It is interesting that the man who looted banks, Nirav Modi shares a similar name to PM and the most corrupt man in Cricket also shares the same name Modi.”  Accusing the Prime Minister of diverting attention from real issues, he added that while farmers and unemployed youth suffered, Modi is asking people to do yoga. “There is no employment. Farmers are dying. And Modiji says, 'Chalo, India Gate Ke Saamne Yoga Karte Hain’.” He was particulalry critical of the RSS which he said was spreading fear and trying to subvert institutions like judiciary, Parliament and the police.  Speaking on the recent controversy where four Supreme Court judges decided to go to media to highlight certain issues, Rahul said, “People of India go to the courts for justice. For the first time, four judges of the Supreme Court had to come to the people for justice. There is a difference between the RSS and the Congress. We respect the country's institutions whereas they want to finish them. They only want one institution and that is the RSS.” Meanwhile, the last day of the session also witnessed former Prime Minister Dr   taking the stage and accusing Modi of making “jumla-type” statements. “I would only say that the BJP Government made tall promises. Modi ji himself said we will double farmers’ incomes in six years time. If you have to double farmers’ incomes in six years time, you need a growth rate of 12 per cent per annum as the minimum. And that is unthinkable. Therefore, it is one of those statements, which is merely a Jumla-type statement, which is not likely to be achieved and Modi ji himself recognises that these are tall promises."" The former prime minister also spoke briefly on the prevailing situation in Kashmir and accused the Modi government of mismanaging the region. “At the same time, we also must recognise that the Modi government has mismanaged the Jammu and Kashmir problem as never before. They have installed a government, where the two wings of the Government are working against each other. The atmosphere in Jammu and Kashmir is deteriorating day in and day out,” he added.  The last day of the plenary also witnessed two resolutions on foreign policy and economy being presented. The resolution on economy was moved by former finance minister P Chidambaram who claimed that if the prevailing situation continues, it will witness the next government facing a major economic crisis. During his address, Chidambaram accused the Prime Minister of pushing people into poverty and claimed that the banking sector is in crisis because of mounting non-performing assets. Continuing his criticism of demonetisation and hastily implemented GST, the former finance minister said that these twin moves led to destruction of jobs. “One party which can pull this country out of crisis is the Congress party. I say that not out of arrogance, not out of conceit. I say that because we have done it before and we will do it again,” he stated. In an uncharacteristic combative mood, Chidambaram, whose son is being investigated on charges of graft, said how many of those present would have felt that he would not be speaking from the dais and even present the economic resolution. Congress also passed another resolution giving Rahul all the powers to constitute a new CWC. The previous CWC was disbanded in wake of the plenary session leading to speculations of CWC being elected through elections. However, that was not supposed to be as it took the party four minutes to give Rahul the absolute power to form his own team.",2018-03-18,, Congress Plenary Day 2: Rahul starts Mission 2019 | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/congress-plenary-day-2-rahul-starts-mission-2019-103597.html
401,Ramakrishna Upadhya,"Internecine war between the ‘original’ Congressmen of Karnataka and ‘migrants’ from other parties, which remained suppressed for long, appears to have raised its head, with Veerappa Moily leading the charge. The veteran Congress leader is known for calibrated moves. But this time he took to micrologging website Twitter to launch a savage, albeit indirect, attack on Siddaramaiah. The Karnataka Chief Minister is considered a migrants’ leader in the Congress. With Assembly elections round the corner, leaders are vying to obtain tickets for their kith and kin. Supporters can come later. And in the Congress – a party where ‘dynasty’ is no cuss word – at least a dozen leaders are trying to gain lateral entries to electoral politics to their progeny.  Moily’s son, Harsha Moily is a serious aspirant for the Congress ticket from Karkala, which Moily Sr represented six terms, before moving to Parliament. At a preliminary meeting presided by the Congress high command’s representative KR Venugopal, leaders put forward their demands. Moily too batted for his son, saying Harsha had been cultivating Karkala for the past three years. But Karnataka Public Works minister HC Mahadevappa, a Siddaramaiah confidante, reportedly sneered at Harsha’s chances of winning and backed Uday Shetty, who had been with the party for over three decades. Veerappa Moily, who earned  ’s trust at the Centre, reportedly silently fumed at ‘migrant’ Mahadevappa’s jibe, but did not react immediately. But that night he set off a ‘bomb’ via his twitter handle.  “INC needs to solve money (problem) in politics. We can’t afford to have road contractors and their nexus with state PWD minister determine how candidates are selected for upcoming Assembly elections.” read Moily's issued around 10 pm.  He had tagged the   official Twitter handle along with those of party chief   and Karnataka Congress. It was retweeted by Harsha within minutes. The father-son duo set the media on fire, putting the Congress completely on the defensive. State BJP boss BS Yeddyurappa joined the tweet-war saying, “Moily is right. We have been saying Siddaramaiah is 10% (commission) CM. With contractors filling PWD minister’s deep pockets, state coffers and roads are in tatters. Cong veteran’s view validates our point.” Moily and Yeddyurappa have both been CMs of Karnataka in the past. Moily later joined the central Cabinet under  . It took Moily more than 12 hours to rebutt the argument and claim that someone else was managing his Twitter handle and the remark attributed to him was “not authorised”. He would never make such negative comments about the party publicly, he said. Harsha also issued a denial saying neither he nor his father was in social media and it had been done by a ‘third party’ who had sent it “without our approval.” Interestingly, they admitted that the comment had gone through their official handles, but neither of them retracted the content. Allegations of money power holding sway in Karnataka was nothing new. Just a few months ago, the Income Tax department recovered a diary from Congress Member of Legislative Council Govindaraj with details of around Rs 600 crore paid to central leaders from time to time.  Govindaraj is known to be close to Siddaramaiah. Investigation into the incident is on. What could have irked Moily more was that the state government has efffectivly sidelined old Congressmen like him in the last five years or so. Siddaramaiah and Mahadevappa joined Congress only in 2006-07.  The later has been aggressively promoting his son Sunil Bose. An internal party survey reportedly indicated Mahadevappa was on a weak wicket in his constituency, T Narasipur, and has planned to switch to CV Raman Nagar in Bengaluru. Bose then can debut from T Narasipur. Bose, who faces police complaints regarding illegal transportation of sand, was nurturing the constituency for some time. He has even been allowed to undertake development works on behalf of his father. He or Harsha are not exceptions. In fact, there is a long list of senior leaders in the Congress who are trying to push their sons or daughters into politics. CM Siddaramaiah has declared that his son Yatheendra will contest from his constituency Varuna while he will move to neighbouring Chamundeshwari.  The list includes other ministers like TB Jayachandra – who wants a ticket for his son Santosh Jayachandra – Ramalinga Reddy and Kagodu Thimmappa (for their daughters Soumya Reddy and Nandini) and Roshan Baig for his son Ruman Baig. The children of Assembly Speaker KB Koliwad, former deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha Rahman Khan and former Union minister Margaret Alva are also aspiring for Assembly tickets. Congress has received about 2,000 applications for the 224 Assembly seats. Wherever it ignores loyal and experienced partymen to accommodate influence-peddlers, it will face rebellion from within. Rival parties may also snap up such rebels. Senior Congress leaders admit that in 2008, the party lost about 30 seats, thanks to bad selection of candidates. Then party observer Prithviraj Chavan expressed dissatisfaction about the role of ‘money power’ in Karnataka and declared that if Congress lost the election, it had nobody to blame but itself. In 2008, Karnataka opened its doors to BJP for the first time, allowing Yeddyurappa to become the first southern BJP CM. In a tight contest, as every seat is going to be crucial, Congress sources say that Siddaramaiah might withdraw his son Yatheendra’s nomination, forcing other aspirants and their backers not to press for tickets.  By taking a high moral ground, Siddaramaiah would be killing two birds with one stone as he would not only brighten chances of Congress emerging the single-largest party, but he would also avoid the risk of shifting to Chamundeshwari, which intelligence agencies reportedly believe is “not very safe” a seat for him.",2018-03-19,, Moily's tweet points to a deeper problem in Karnataka Congress | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/moily-s-tweet-points-to-a-deeper-problem-in-karnataka-congress-103748.html
402,Akash Bisht,"On Day 1 of Indian National Congresss two-day plenary session in Delhi Saturday senior Congress leaders sharpening their attack on bete noire  . Former party president   took the lead, lambasting the   government for being power hungry. The “dramebaaz attitude” of the ruling dispensation will lead to Congress returning to power in Karnataka and that will provide a new direction to the country's politics, said Gandhi. “Backed by evidence, we are continuously exposing the fraudulent promises and corrupt practices of Prime Minister Modi and his associates. People have now understood that slogans like 'sabka saath sabka vikas', ' na kahoonga na khaane doonga' and his Man ki Baat on radio were just gimmickry and a trick to get votes and the chair,” she added. The results of the Gujarat Assembly elections and bye-polls in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh reflect that “those who wished to erase our existence had no clues that there is so much respect for the Congress,” said the leader.  “In the last four years, this government has made every efforts to destroy Congress without realising that it has and will never bow down to the arrogance of power,” she said amid cheers and applause by thousands of party workers who gathered from across the country. Urging the Congress workers to be ready to make sacrifices, she said: “ We need to struggle to make a India that is free of fear and intimidation. An India where each man can live with dignity. An India that is free of biases, vengeance and outcry.”  She also said her son Rahul has taken over the Congress presidentship at a very challenging time.  In his opening remarks, Rahul took pot shots at the BJP, claiming that attempts were being made to spread hatred and create divisions within the society. He highlighted how Indians were being pitted against each other and said: “Our work is to unite people.” Speaking amidst slogans of '  zindabad', the newly elected president said the biggest difference between the Congress and the BJP was that they use divisive politics while we use love and brotherhood. “I want to reiterate that this nation belongs to every religion, caste and person, and whatever Congress will do, it will do for the nation and no one will be left behind,” he added.  Taking digs at Modi, the Congress president said the youth of the country have lost hope and whenever they look at the Prime Minister, they don't see any hope of securing employment. “The nation is in a way tired and looking for a way out and I can tell you with all my heart that only Congress is capable of showing them a way,” he said. According to a political resolution passed, India's core constitutional values are under attack and freedom was in jeopardy with institutions under stress and their independence compromised. The political resolution particularly tore into the RSS for systematic assault on principles of Constitution and values of Indian republic.  “The RSS-BJP is misrepresenting, distorting and misusing religion to exploit the sentiments of the people and capture political power. The toxic mix of religion and politics, poses a challenge to our pluralistic society and inclusive democracy. RSS, which claims to be a social and cultural organisation, masquerades as sole representative of the Hindus,” read the resolution moved by senior party leader Mallikarjun Kharge.  It accused the BJP government of brazenly misusing the constitutional office of governors and resorting to unethical means to destabilise elected governments, hijack popular mandates and foisting governments by manufacturing majority. The resolution read: “Congress deplores the government for undermining the established norms of governance and subversion of educational, cultural and historical institutions, facilitating their capture by the BJP's ideological affiliates. RSS infiltration of every Institution, Administration and the Universities, poses a threat to pluralism and Indian Democracy. The centralisation of authority, arbitrary and partisan decision making, has cast a dark shadow on Parliamentary democracy.” (sic) The resolution demanded that to ensure the credibility of the electoral process, the Election Commission should revert to the old practice of ballot papers instead of electronic voting machines (EVM) as emulated by other democracies world over.  Until now, Congress had never raised the EVM issue from a party platform and this marks a major shift in its views over EVMs. “There are apprehensions among the Political Parties and the people over the misuse of EVMs to manipulate the outcome contrary to the popular verdict,” the resolution noted.  The resolution also dismissed Modi's idea of holding simultaneous polls and called it “impractical” and “incompatible with Constitution”. The party noted that if allowed, it could have serious implications which must be thoroughly “enquired into” and a national consensus be built around it. The party decided to adopt a pragmatic approach to co-operation with like-minded parties and evolve a common workable programme to defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Earlier in 1998, during the Panchmarhi session, party leaders had unanimously decided to not allign with any party. However, five years later in 2003, the party decided to have an understanding with other like-minded parties which led to UPA coming to power in 2004. Meanwhile, the party also passed another resolution on 'Agriculture, Employment & Poverty Alleviation' wherein it made several promises to address these issues. For the farm sector, one of the most prominent promises of the party is to bring a loan waiver scheme for all small and marginal farmers on the pattern of the farm loan waiver program of the UPA govt in 2009 benefitting 3.2 crore farmers. Resolving to bring in a farmer centric paradigm shift in the Indian agriculture, the party accused the BJP of duping farmers by making empty noises of doubling farm income by 2022.  “The crop insurance scheme brought by the government has benefited private insurance companies more than the farmer as money is taken away from the bank accounts of farmers, without their consent,” read the resolution. Similar promises were made for creating employment and poverty alleviation during the first day of the plenary.",2018-03-17,, Scrap EVMs says Congress on Day 1 of Plenary.

403,Sulagna Sengupta,"The seeds of a non-BJP, non-Congress federal front seemed to have been sown Monday at a meeting between Mamata Banerjee and K Chandrasekar Rao – the chief ministers of West Bengal and Telangana, respectively, in Kolkata. The two strong CMs emerged hopeful off the meeting at Nabanna, the Bengal state secretariat. The discussion seemed to have centred around a new political alliance and both expressed satisfaction at a “good beginning”.  “Leaders come out of situations. The federal front will be different from traditional models of political alignments... There is a need for a qualitative change because of the emerging economy. The front will glorify the masses of India,” he said.  “There may be some political parties with different viewpoints and some may share ideas. Some parties are friends, some enemies,” said Rao, who was accompanied by two party parliamentarians K Kavitha and K Keshav Rao. Banerjee said: “I maintain good relations with all parties... We both expressed our views; let us discuss take it forward. We are not in a hurry.” According too the Bengal CM every regional party has its own strength and possibilities need to be discussed. “We should approach other  political parties and eventually a consensus will come among all political parties,” she said. “Politics is a continuous process. As we love India as a nation, we should think how to deliver better,” Banerjee added.  Praising her Bengal counterpart, Rao said: “I came here 13 years ago. There has been tremendous development under the leadership of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. She has transformed Bengal.” Stressed the need to find political alternatives, he said:”We do not follow the model prevalent for the last 71 years. New policies and ideologies are needed and we have to re-orient ourselves to new ideas.” Rao was not the first leader Banerjee has met. Last week former Union minister Praful Patel of Nationalist Congress Party called on her at the same venue. He said Banerjee and his party chief Sharad Pawar found a need for an immediate meeting of like-minded political parties to form an alternative platform to counter the BJP at the Centre.  Opposition parties will meet in New Delhi on 27-28 March.

404,Rajeev Khanna,"The alleged scam regarding the purchase of medicines and equipment at inflated costs for public hospitals in Haryana has the potential to increase the  's problems before the Lok Sabha elections next year. It can also mar re-election chances of the Manohar Lal Khattar government. The allegations came Sunday from Dushyant Chautala of Indian National Lok Dal, who represents Hisar in Lok Sabha. Khattar's government bought implements, medicines, cotton rolls, face masks, pregnancy strips and hand sanitisers at inflated cost in Rewari, Hisar, Fatehabad, Rohtak and Jind districts, Chautala alleged citing information received through the Right to Information Act. The civil surgeon in Fatehabad procured face masks for Rs 4.90 while it was available there for 95 paise only, Chautala alleged. Similarly, 500 gram cotton rolls were bought for Rs 140 each but they could have been purchased at Rs 99 at the tender rate. Digital blood pressure costs were Rs 1,600 – more than double of Rs 780 normally. Hand sanitizers (400 ml) procured for Rs 325 could have been bought for Rs 185. Some blood collection tubes were procured for thrice the market rate from a firm in Hisar whose owner is in jail for minting fabricated coins. “The firms, shown in the RTI-stamped papers, from which the medicines or equipment were purchased, do not exist,” Chautala said. “One company from which medicines were purchased is registered to sell daily-need items. In another case, the address of the firm turned out to be that of a washer man’s shop,” he added.  The purchases were under National Health Mission and Mukhya Mantri Muft Ilaaj Yojana. Three firms were shown operating from the same address in Hisar and Fatehabad. In Rewari the purchase committee obtained six drugs from a Hisar firm that does not have license to supply drugs. It was also supplying drugs to Fatehabad. The INLD alleged that instead of deciding on suppliers through tendering, quotations were invited only at the level of civil surgeons. In Rohtak, it alleged, procurements worth Rs 3 crore were done without any committee being formed. RTI papers show no signature, date or letter numbers in such. According to Chautala, state authorities were reluctant to part with information, which was eventually obtained after the intervention of Punjab and Haryana High Court. “Rewari was a classic case of denial of information. They gave over 5,000 pages of information. All the papers were photo copies of electricity bills of hospitals. But one page was related to the purchase of medicines. This page turned out to be the tip of the iceberg,” Chautala reportedly said, underlining that it took his party around a year to collect information. The INLD has pegged the scam at Rs 125 crore in the five districts alone and apprehended it could go up to more than Rs 300 cr. The party demanded that the matter be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij has already recommended that the Comptroller and Auditor General look into the matter. The state government distributed Rs 87.60 cr under Mukhyamantri Muft Ilaaj Yojana and National Health Mission from 2014 to 2017, of which only Rs 40.89 cr was spent, Vij said, questoning the INLD's Rs 300-cr claim. Vij said civil surgeons have been directed to purchase products online. Calling Chautala's allegations “baseless and misleading” he contested the allegations district wise armed with his own set of papers. The minister claimed face masks in Fatehabad 2,000 triple layer sterilized masks were bought through e-tendering at Rs 4.90 each. The 1,000 masks mentioned by the INLD were common ones that cost 95 paise a piece. Some observers pointed out that irregularities under health schemes were nothing new in Haryana, particularly in remote districts. However, what remains to be seen this time is whether the INLD is able to make an electoral issue out of it.",2018-03-20,, Haryana medical scam: Will the opposition succeed in making it a poll issue | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/haryana-medical-scam-will-the-opposition-succeed-in-making-it-a-poll-issue-103906.html
405,Rajeev Khanna,"Grappling with continuing attacks on minorities and their institutions, various Muslim organisations in Gujarat are trying to find a way out. Around 400 representatives of various social organisations gathered in Ahmedabad Sunday to take stock of the situation, its graveness and to discuss the road ahead. The gathering discussed how the Gujarat model of communal violence has spread to other states like Jharkhand and Rajasthan, said Mujahid Nafees, one of the organisers. Also, the cauldron of hate was being kept alive in Gujarat's remote parts from where objective reportage is difficult to emerge, he added. “Four dargahs in Kutch district have been desecrated in the last two months. We took it up with the Director General of Police (DGP) and cases were registered against unknown persons. But nobody has been arrested,” Nafees said.  “Also, the the roof of a temple was demolished. We have called for prompt investigations into the incident. These can lead to full-blown communal violence across the state,” he added.  Kutch has otherwise been known as one of the most peaceful districts but efforts to disturb that has been seen at regular intervals. The fact that the district borders Pakistan can help the agenda of perpetrators of communal violence. Meanwhile, hate messages continued unabated on social media across the state, activists said. Sustained communal campaign against Muslims in Gandhinagar district's Chhatral area left one youth dead while his mother three of her digits.  Shamshad Pathan of Alpsankhyak Adhikar Manch points out that in Mehsana district's Kadi region vitriolic social media posts have been doing the rounds that some Muslim boys from a local school has been harassing Hindu girls.  He said Hindutva organisations were trying to break the Dalit-Muslim cohesion that has emerged in these parts. Hindu fringe groups want to ensure a 'Gharwapsi' of Dalits, he added.  Hindutva organisations are widely believed to have used Dalits to target Muslims during the 2002 violence. But their social and economic conditions have led to Dalits and Muslims co-existing in poorer parts of Gujarati cities and towns. True, many Dalit and Muslim ghettoes came up in big cities after 2002, but there still remain slums, mainly in small towns and villages, where they continue to live side by side. “Things need to be looked from a larger perspective. They are now targeting small towns and villages,” Pathan said. “  (BJP) leader Vinay Katiyar's recent call for sacrifice for Ram temple in Uttar Pradesh can't be looked in isolation. The BJP came to power on the development plank in 2014 but has failed miserably. So it now wants to return to the temple issue that fueled its growth in Gujarat in the 1990s,” he added. In fact, many Muslims have expressed fears of a communal flare up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Sunday's convention passed a resolutions apprehending such fears and seeking early redressal.  They expressed particular concern over the continuing 'deeksha' programmes by Hindutva organisations where tridents are being distributed. The first resolution passed seeks an immediate end to such events and arms training. The second resolution was regarding the government adhering to the recommendations of the Sachar Committee so that the Muslims are able to get rid of their various fears and apprehensions. The participants demanded a Minorities Commission be set up in the state, with powers of a civil court. They also demanded that a Minorities (Prevention of Atrocities) Act be enacted for ensuring their safety and security. Alleging that there was a deliberate attempt across the country to destroy the livelihood and businesses of Muslims, the participants said Muslim organisations need to come together to send a strong message. “Next week we will hand a memorandum of demands to the governor. We will also demonstrate during the next Assembly session. We want want to make this a national issue,” Nafees said.",2018-03-21,," Grappling systematic communal assault, Muslims try to find a way out | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/grappling-systematic-communal-assault-gujarat-muslim-try-to-find-a-way-out-104086.html
406,Charu Kartikeya,"With just about a year left for the term of the current Lok Sabha to end, heavy churning has begun in political corridors. The latest bye-polls in Uttar Pradesh were an early indicator of this churn. A large number of other key signals are coming from Bihar. Bihar also saw bye-polls, along with UP, for one Lok Sabha and two state Assembly seats, but two noteworthy events had happened before the bye-polls. Former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi left the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and joined the anti-BJP camp and a sidelined IPS officer with a particularly communal past was made the state police chief. These two events were indicative of two broader narratives playing out in Bihar, which has continued after the bye-polls too. One, the BJP appears to be asserting itself over the state government, in a bid to emerge as the leading player on its own. Two, its other National Democratic Aliance (NDA) allies, including the governing   (United), have realised this and have started scouting for options and back-up plans. Let us look at five other developments that have taken place after the bye-polls and let us try to understand what they seem to be indicating.  – It is true that Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) is not too big a player in the state, with just one MLA in the state Assembly. However, the part commands a vote share of 2.3% that can come in handy in a rainbow coalition. His exit, therefore, indicates a definite shrinking of the NDA in Bihar. Manjhi was never comfortable with Chief Minister  , having fought with the latter bitterly over his own removal as CM. He was said to be unhappy with the BJP's decision to welcome Kumar back in the NDA and eventually moved out after realising that he wasn't being made a part of the NDA government in Bihar. Union Minister and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) leader Upendra Kushwaha harbours similar misgivings towards Kumar, having left JD(U) to create RLSP after a bitter fall-out with the latter. He has also been reportedly uncomfortable with Kumar's return to NDA. Though, on record, Kushwaha has denied any plans to quit NDA, sources say his statement is an eye-wash and he is only waiting for the right moment to make a move.  – KS Dwivedi, recently appointed Bihar DGP, was SP in Bhagalpur during the 1989 riots and the state government's commission of inquiry into the riots had made adverse comments about his role (http://indianexpress.com/article/india/bihar-govt-tells-critics-why-it-made-k-s-dwivedi-dgp-5083405/). Opposition parties have alleged that he was appointed at the BJP's  . BJP also appears to be working on a polarisation campaign in Bihar, as is evident from recent incidents in Bhagalpur. The town saw a communal clash on 17 March over a Hindu procession that passed through a Muslim-dominated locality reportedly without police permission. Police has lodged a   against 20 people in connection with the violence and those named include BJP leader Arijit Shashwat, the son of Union Minister Ashwani Choubey.  Another controversy is brewing over the beheading of the father of a BJP leader in Darbhanga. Several BJP leaders, including state BJP chief Nityanand Rai and Union Minister Giriraj Singh, had alleged that the victim was killed because he had led the renaming of a local square in the name of Prime Minister  . However, CM Kumar and the state police have asserted that the beheading took place over a  .   – Kumar also appears to have started signaling discomfort with the BJP. The state police's case against Choubey' son and the CM's assertion in the Darbhanga case that it was the result of a land dispute are all being seen as indications of a counter-assertion on his part.  Interestingly, he has also said in the wake of these incidents that he will not compromise on the maintenance of   in the state. This is being seen as his veiled message to the BJP to stop its campaigns.   – Union Minister and Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan recently sprang a   when he commented on the BJP, for the first time ever in last four years. After the BJP leaders' comments on the Bhagalpur and Darbhanga were reported, Paswan hit out at BJP and urged the party to pursue a secular agenda. He also said, “We ought to look carefully at how Congress remained in power in the country for so long, enjoying the support of Dalits, Brahmins and Muslims without actually doing anything for them.”. Many are looking at Paswan's statements as the definitive indicator of changing equations in the state. Sources in Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress told Catch they were indeed looking at Paswan's statements as a concrete indicator that he was reading a change.

407,Charu Kartikeya,"Since the High Court has not cast any aspersions on the merits of the case, the case still stands. The EC will be required to hear the case again and give an opportunity to all the 20 AAP MLAs to present their arguments. However, there are two other concerns at hand that have also been flagged earlier and deserve a mention again. In September 2015, the Delhi high court had struck down the post of parliament secretary itself, ruling that the appointment of the MLAs on the posts was unconstitutional, because the LG had not given his assent. This led the AAP to argue that since the appointment itself was quashed, no office-of-profit case arose. Achary supported the contention and noted that the High Court ruling meant that the MLAs had served as parliamentary secretaries not even for a moment as the very posts were declared unconstitutional. Achary had also pointed out that once the issue became a legal one, the case should have been heard by a court of law as EC is not an authority that can decide on a legal issue. These concerns are likely to come up again. In whatever manner the case progresses from hear on, the latest ruling has shown the EC as well as the office of the President in negative light. Patel, the petitioner advocate, whose pro-Hindutva inclinations are clearly visible on his twitter time-line, is finding it hard to respond to the ruling. In an earlier tweet, he had implied that Delhi HC will uphold the disqualification of the MLAs and Delhi will see by-elections after that. Following the ruling, he said he had just raised a constitutional issue and there was no setback for him. The petitioner's background suggests that this case does have elements of conspiracy and the HC ruling has established that EC and the President too played along.  It is time for both the sullied institutions to make amends and take steps to ensure the restoration of their image as non-partisan defenders of the Constitution.The Delhi High Court landed a surprise judgement Friday, setting aside the disqualification of 20 Members of the Legisltive Assembly from the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) for allegedly holding offices of profit. In doing so, the court quashed the Presidential order disqualifying the legislators. The court ruled that the Election Commission (EC) did not follow principles of natural justice while holding proceedings in the case, by not inviting the MLAs to put forth their  . The court has now sent the matter back to the EC for holding proper hearing. This does mean that the case is still alive as the court has not commented on the merits of the case. However, the setting aside of the disqualification will come as a major embarrassment for not just the SC, but President   as well.  EC's action was always suspect, President made matters worse. It was in June 2015 that Delhi-based advocate Prashant Patel had petitioned then President   to disqualify 21 AAP MLAs for allegedly holding parallel offices of profit.  Earlier that year, Delhi Chief Minister   had appointed these MLAs as parliamentary secretaries, a position that Patel alleged was an office of profit. Mukherjee had then referred the case to the EC for its opinion, which the latter then took nearly two years to formulate and provide. The EC submitted its opinion quietly on the last working day of the retiring chief election commissioner in January 2018.

Referring to media reports, Prasad also demanded the Congress to come clean about its meetings with now-sacked CA CEO Alexender Nix “How many times did Rahul Gandhi and Nix meet and what did they discuss? What is the CA's role in Rahul Gandhi's social media presence,"" he asked. I want to specifically warn the Congress that the nation will not tolerate any kind of data theft or manipulation in India,"" he said. Prasad even went to the extent of dramatically threatening Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and said that he can be summoned to India if required. “Abuse of social media including Facebook cannot be allowed to impact the fairness of elections. In the wake of recent data theft from Facebook, let my stern warning be heard across the Atlantic, far away in California,"" said the minister. “Any covert or overt attempt to misuse social media including Facebook to influence India's electoral process through undesirable means will neither be tolerated, nor be permitted. Let Facebook note it very clearly,” added the minister. On 19 March, right-wing website   made similar allegations in a  , “Has Cambridge Analytica already breached your privacy for Congress”. Quick to dismiss Prasad's charges, the Congress went on the offensive and questioned the BJP’s links with CA. Referring to BJP ministers' and party IT cell’s penchant for spreading fake news, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala dubbed as “fake” Prasad’s press conference. “BJP's factory of fake news has produced one more fake product today. It appears fake statements, fake press conferences & fake agendas have become everyday character of BJP and its 'Lawless' Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad,” said Surjewala. He said the Prasad assertions are aimed at diverting the attention from the Modi government’s lies about the 39 Indians killed by ISIS in Iraq. This is also to ensure that there are no questions raised over the provisions of SC/ST Act being diluted. He alleged that Prime Minister   and his ministerial colleagues were pressurising the media to carry the agenda only that favoured the BJP and blackout those opposing or criticising it. While asserting that Congress or Gandhi never used or hired the services of Cambridge Analytica, Surjewala claimed the contrary. “The BJP and JD(U) used Cambridge Analytica. The BJP hired the Indian business partner of Cambridge Analytica — Ovleno Business Intelligence (OBI) during Delhi Assembly election and used its services. “OBI is being run by the BJP ally’s MP’s son. OBI company’s services were used by   in 2009,” alleged Surjewala adding that the services were also used by the BJP during the Delhi assembly polls. Surjewala also read out OBI vice-president Himanshu Sharma’s linkedin profile to buttress his claims. “Managed four election campaigns successfully for the ruling party- BJP achieve its target of 272+ by managing Cell Centre Management Project Profiling of each and every volunteer/supporter who had extended his support to get involved in our Mission 272+ and confidentially maintaining the database provided to BJP candidate as an additional support for national elections and state elections of Haryana, Jharkhand and Delhi,” Surjewala said reading out the information from Sharma’s profile. Congress party's social media head Divya Spandana also refuted Prasad charges calling them to diversionary.  While the sensational Cambridge Analytica (CA) scandal continues to unfold in the US and UK attracting global outrage, in India it has triggered a massive political slugfest between the Centre’s ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress. If the BJP used reports of the CA’s “sleazy tactics” and data manipulation to target Congress and its President   alleging links with the tainted firm, the Congress hit back with similar accusations. The first salvo was fired by Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari who said the said the Election Commission should inquire about the services rendered by the firm in India and to whom. He cited a media report that claimed CA had worked in many countries including India.  ",2018-03-21,, Cambridge Analytica scandal triggers BJP-Congress war of words | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/cambridge-analytica-scandal-triggers-bjp-congress-war-of-words-104095.html
409,Priyata Brajabasi,"Even as Jawaharlal Nehru University grapples with sexual harassment charges against Atul Johri, a fresh issue of sexual misconduct has come to the fore. The Delhi High Court recently issued multiple notices over a petition by a JNU student who alleged that Mahendra P Lama, a professor harassed him for helping another student who faced sexual misconduct by him. That's not all. According to sources, Lama faces sexual harassment charges from two female research scholars too. Lama is with JNU's Centre for South Asia Studies (CSAS) under School of International Studies (SIS). In the first case of the petition, filed by Prashant Kr Sharma, the high court on 20 March sent notices to:  They were given a week to respond. Petitioner Sharma is pursuing a PhD from CSAS. He reportedly helped a female research scholar who escaped from China after alleged sexual harassment by Lama when the two were there as part of a research team on 17 October, 2017. Sharma told Catch that since then Lama and Kharat harassed him – his synopsis was not cleared and his registration for the new semester in January was stalled.  “He had no choice but to move court as he was being repeatedly harassed by the accused,” Sharma’s lawyer Dibyanshu Pandey told Catch. “Sharma is from a poor family and he is being threatened that he would not be allowed to complete his PhD because he helped the student escape,” he said. He also alleged that he was repeatedly asked to dissuade the female student from making an official complaint to JNU's Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). She, however, did complain and an investigation is underway. Her supervisor was also changed.  Lama, however, was not suspended or restrained from taking classes. He is also on the panel for admissions for the upcoming academic session. In January, ICC received complaints of sexual harassment complaints against Lama and Karat from two more students. They were also being supervised by Lama for their thesis.  An e-mail by one of the two students, addressed to Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar among others, went viral recently. Excerpts: “I write with regards to the complaints that I have registered with ICC on 8th January 2018. I had registered a complaint of sexual harassment against Prof. M.P.

There are strong possibilities that if they are not removed from the panel and suspended immediately, the inquiry will be influenced.""  None of the female complainants approached the police, unlike in Johri's case. On the campus, students affiliated with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad alleged that the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) and the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) were shielding the accused professors. “Large-scale have taken place against Prof Johri, who is a supporter of the VC. But there is no mention of Prof Lama as well as Prof Karat and Prof Pathnayak who are shielding him... You can see the hypocrisy of the Left,” Vinay Kumar, ABVP's JNU wing president, told  .  Former JNUTA president Ayesha Kidwai refuted the allegations. “The Atul Johri case reached prominence because of police complaints were registered due to the incompetence of the ICC... It is the incompetence of the ICC due to which the said professors have not been found guilty or suspended and they are still part of the panel of interviewers.” She said as ICC doesn't divulge identities nobody knew about the cases against Lama and Kharat. There was no response from a representatives of the JNUSU, which was involved in a scuffle with Delhi Police on Friday over protests regarding Johri's case.

410,News Agencies,"Congress MPs, led by party chief  , today staged a protest in front of Mahatma Gandhi's statue inside Parliament premises, demanding that the Centre seeks a review of the Supreme Court's verdict on the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The apex court had on Tuesday diluted its stringent provisions mandating immediate arrest under the law in a bid to protect honest public servants discharging bona fide duties from being blackmailed with false cases under the SC/ST Act. The Congress MPs raised the slogan, ""Daliton ke samman mein, Rahul Gandhi maidan mein (Rahul Gandhi stands for protection of Dalit's rights)."" Earlier, the MPs gathered at the office of the Congress Parliament Party and discussed the strategy to move forward on the issue. Sources said the party's strategy inside Parliament was also discussed with Gandhi during the meeting. Both Houses of Parliament - the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha - have not been functioning ever since the start of the second leg of the Budget Session on March 5. This is the third week in a row that Parliament proceedings have been disrupted and has not transacted any business. The crucial Finance Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha amid the din created by various parties. Attempts by Rajya Sabha Chairman M   and Lok Sabha Speaker   to work out a solution to ensure smooth conduct of business have yielded no results. --PTI Also Read: ",2018-03-23,"SC/ST Atrocities Act,Rahul Gandhi,congress protest,parliament,Mahatma Gandhi's statue,Centre,Supreme Court"," Led by Rahul Gandhi, Congress MPs stage protest demanding review plea on SC verdict on SC/ST Act | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/led-by-rahul-gandhi-congress-mps-stage-protest-demanding-review-plea-on-sc-verdict-on-sc-st-act-104393.html
411,Akash Bisht,"  Meanwhile, as media began to speculate on Babbar's successor, senior party leader and Rajya Sabha MP, Pramod Tewari, vehemently denied any offer of resignation and claimed that Babbar continues to be the party's state chief.   A senior Congress leader, while scotching rumors of his resignation, claimed that he had offered to resign after the 2017 Assembly polls. He did claim that Babbar was under tremendous pressure after the party's disastrous performance in the recently held by-polls in Phulpur and Gorakhpur. However, there is a significant possibility of Babbar being replaced with a young Brahmin face in the near future. The Grand Old Party is hoping that an upper caste will help in countering BJP's non-Yadav OBC and non-Jatav Dalit consolidation. Among those who are in the reckoning for the party's state president include former Union minister Jitin Prasad, Rajesh Mishra and Laliteshpati Tripathi. Speculations over Babbar's resignation is reminiscent of Bharatsinh Solanki's alleged offer of stepping down as Gujarat PCC president. Reports suggested that upset with not being nominated for Rajya Sabha from Gujarat had led to Solanki's decision. However, Solanki too denied these claims and maintained that there was no truth in these rumors. Apparently, Solanki too had offered to step down after the party's performance in 2017 assembly elections. If Solanki does resign, Congress is expected to experiment with yet another young face in the state. Among those being considered in the race include former PCC chief Shaktisinh Gohil, who was instrumental in securing a Rajya Sabha seat for senior leader Ahmed Patel. Even Patidar leader Paresh Dhanani is in the reckoning but it is unlikely considering he is currently the legislature leader of the party in Gujarat. Meanwhile, it was Goa state PCC chief Shantaram Naik who was first to resign after Rahul's call for infusing young blood in prominent party positions. Naik claimed that he was inspired by Rahul's speech and submitted his resignation soon after he returned from Delhi after attending the plenary session. Sources have informed that Goa is witnessing a political crisis ever since chief minister   was diagnosed with cancer. Congress has sensed that Parrikar's absence from the state has given them an opportunity to lure BJP's allies who remain crucial to government's stability in the state. Allies like Goa Forward Party, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and independents had agreed to be part of the government on one condition that Parrikar was named the chief minister. Back then BJP readily agreed to the proposition and asked Parrikar to resign as Union defence minister to take over as chief minister. However, in his absence, Congress is hoping to create fissures in the alliance and would certainly need someone who can negotiate with the likes of Sardesai, who had earlier fought elections as a Congress candidate. It is for this reason that Congress has been careful in naming Naik's successor and is looking for someone who is young and has some experience in handling the party's organisational setup. Sources have informed that among those who are in the reckoning include former Youth Congress president Girish Chodankar and high court lawyer Yatish Naik. Chodankar had earlier contested against Parrikar from Panaji where he lost while Naik is the young party spokesperson who is articulate and a backroom strategist. Former MP Francisco Sardinha and Digamabar Kamat have also thrown their hat in the ring. Kamat could also emerge as Naik's successor considering his proximity to Sardesai and even the other state leaders could come to a consensus on his candidature. Meanwhile, changes are expected in states like Odisha, Bihar, Kerala and Haryana. The party unity is at its worst in Odisha where Congress has conceded the opposition to BJP in recent years. The state leadership holds the incumbent PCC president PK Harichandan for the party's disastrous performance in recent times. IN fact, the state leadership has on several occasions urged central leadership to replace Hariharan. Similarly, Mumbai Regional Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam, who is at loggerheads with Maharashtra leadership, could also be shunted out to accommodate a more acceptable face. In Bihar, the party had replaced former PCC chief Ashok Chowdhary with Kaukab Qadri as a temporary arrangement after the former was accused to splitting the party. In Bihar, rumors of Qadri being replaced with an upper caste leader have been gaining momentum. It is expected that Akhilesh Pratap Singh could be handed over the reigns of the state unit. In fact, Singh was given prominence over others during the plenary session where he along with other young faces was seen coordinating the event. Similar changes are expected in Haryana and Kerala where party is looking to give prominence to young leaders.Congress president  's concluding speech at the 84th plenary session seems to have struck a chord with senior state unit presidents who one after another are offering to resign from their posts to give young leadership a chance to lead the state units in the run up to 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Rahul had in his speech promised to demolish the walls that existed between the cadres and leaders and promised to put more focus on youth. Since then, there has been a lot of speculation over the resignations of PCC chiefs with the latest being that of UP state president Raj Babbar offering to resign. Babbar, who has had a disastrous outing as party chief ever since he took over before the 2017 Assembly polls, was quoted by ANI as saying, “New arrangements are being worked out in the Congress. Whatever new positions will be given by party president, we will take them up and work towards 2019.” When asked whether he has tendered his resignation due to party's poor show in the recently held by-polls in UP, Babbar informed ANI, “Whatever I have to say, I talk it out with my party President, the same (defeats) has been happening and is happening.” However, it was Babbar's tweet, wherein he quoted Hindi poet Kedarnath Singh, which led to speculations on him offering to resign.",2018-03-21,, Rahul Gandhi effect: Young guns all set to take charge of Congress state units | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/rahul-gandhi-effect-young-guns-all-set-to-take-charge-of-congress-state-units-104096.html
412,Ramakrishna Upadhya,"The writing is clearly on the wall. Generally, no single issue can substantially alter the outcome of an election. But, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s great gamble in splitting the Lingayat community could either make or break the Congress party’s fortunes in the Assembly elections, due in less than two months. The state Cabinet this week decided to recommend to the Centre that Lingayats be recognised as a religion separate from Hindus, and they be accorded minority status. This has sent tremors both in the Congress and BJP circles as such a move can have far-reaching implications on elections across the state. The Veerashaiva-Lingayats – who constitute the single-largest community accounting for 17% of the state’s population – have the potential to sway the results in as many as 130 out of 224 constituencies. That is slightly more than what is required for a clear majority. Lingayats were traditional supporters of the Congress – Six Karnata chief ministers from the Congress, including S Nijalingappa, BD Jatti, SR Kanti and Veerendra Patil, were Lingayats.  But the community also played a major role in ousting the Grand Old Party from power. In 1980 Lingayats switched loyalties to Janata Parivar and solidly backed Ramakrishna Hegde (a Brahmin, whom the Lingayats trusted) and JH Patel (a Lingayat). When the Janata experiment crumbled, the Congress brought back Veerendra Patil as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president. He won an unprecedented mandate, winning 181 seats in the 1989 Assmbly elections. After being in disarray for a decade-and-a-half the Lingayats regrouped and found a saviour in BS Yeddyurappa, who opened the gates to South India for the   in 2008. He may have lost power as chief minister after being embroiled in corruption charges, but to this day, he remains the undisputed leader of the Lingayat community. Siddaramaiah is all too conscious of the fact that the Congress could never have won the 2013 Assembly elections but for Yeddyurappa. Miffed at being asked to resign as CM, he quit the BJP and put up candidates under the Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP) banner. As a result, the BJP was down to 40 seats from 110. The KJP managed only five seats, but Yeddyurappa drew nearly 10% of the votes, helping catapult the Congress to power. Siddaramaiah’s supporters love to compare him to D Devraj Urs, one of the best and shrewdest CMs Karnataka has had. Urs hailed from a miniscule minority Kshatriya community, but the social engineering he achieved under tremendous odds kept him in power for eight years. He would have continued longer had he not developed national ambitions and lost focus. In comparison, Siddaramaiah, though an able administrator, has shown castiest tendencies. He has foisted officials from his Kuruba community in many key positions, earning the wrath of major communities like Vokkaliga and Lingayat. The Vokkaligas constitute nearly 12% of the state's population and are predominantly settled in old Mysore areas. They look upon former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda as their messiah – the only reason why the   (Secular) still remains relevant and a force to reckon with. Positioning himself as a leader of ‘Ahinda’ (an acronym for backward classes, scheduled castes, tribes and muslims), Siddaramaiah has retained for Congress a vote base, but it is not sufficient to go past the winning post. Even within this ‘vote bank,’ the Madigas – a large scheduled caste – is unhappy at not being given adequate reservation in jobs and educational institutions as recommended by a judicial commission. Yeddyurappa returned to the BJP just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, and two years ago the party unequivocally him as its chief ministerial candidate. This would have led Siddaramaiah to calculate that unless he turned a chunk of Lingayat votes towards the Congress, the party could not be sure of victory. The BJP began to consolidate Lingayat votes by projecting 12th century reformer Basaveshwara or Basavanna – the community's spiritual and philosophical leader – at national and international levels. Prime Minister   unveiled Basaveshwara’s bust in London and followed it up by releasing volumes of Basavanna’s Vachanas (prose-poetry) in 23 different languages.  After this Siddaramaiah suddenly ordered all state government offices to display Basavanna’s photos along with other leaders. This move drew accolades from all sides. For the Congress, it was the beginning of the appropriation of Basavanna's legacy.  At one of the felicitation functions that followed, a section of Lingayats raised the demand for a separate status for the community, which has often been voiced over the last 75 years without much success. As Siddaramaiah and his think tank mulled over the issue, they saw a golden opportunity to create a wedge in the Lingayat community and strike at this strong vote base of the BJP. MB Patil, Basavaraj Rayareddy and Vinay Kulkarni, the Lingayat faces in the Cabinet, were deployed to draw favourably inclined heads of Lingayat mutts to organise huge rallies across the state to mobilise public support.  The heads of powerful mutts such as Siddaganga and Suttur, who have huge followers because of their educational and philanthropic activities, quietly opposed the move to split the community but did not come out in the open. Thus, Siddaramaiah’s desire to obtain a ‘consensus’ before taking a decision failed. There was intense division within the Cabinet and a decision on splitting the Lingayats was twice postponed. A nervous Congress high command asked Siddaramaiah to exercise caution, but as the CM of the only large state Congress still controls, Siddaramaiah had his way. To assuage the feelings of those who were opposed to the move, the cabinet decided that apart from Lingayats even Veerashaivas who believed in Basavanna’s teachings, could be members of the new minority religion. The Karnataka government will soon put the ball in the Centre’s court as recognising any group as a religious minority requires a long legal process, including approval by Parliament. “If a group of Lingayats want to declare themselves as a separate faith, they can do so and the state will have no role in it. People have the right to follow any faith they believe in,” Senior Supreme Court advocate Mohan Katharki said.  “But, if the Lingayats want to be recognised as a religious minority, the power lies with the Centre under Sec 2 (f) of the National Commission for Minority Educational Act of 2004,” he pointed out. The Karnataka Veerashaiva Mahasabha, which had initially welcomed the government’s decision, did a U-turn after consulting some heads of religious mutts. It said it could never accept the decision to be part of a separate religion. Basavanna, the 12th century reformer, revolted against Brahminism and tried to introduce a classless, casteless homogeneity among people. He firmly believed in humanity as one religion, but ironically, over a period of time, his followers began to identify themselves as Veerashaivas or Lingayats within the Hindu fold. The proponents of ‘Lingayatism’ as a separate religion are holding out the carrot of special privileges once they are recognised as a ‘minority,’ along with five other minority groups, including Muslims, Christians and Jains. But it is well recognised that Lingayats have been an integral part of the Hindu society, worshipping Hindu gods, visiting temples and following Hindu practices.  In fact, in 2013, the UPA government rejected a request made by the Veerashiva Mahasabha for a separate religion status. The Registrar General of India, who had been consulted, noted that “Veerashaiva-Lingayat is a sect of the Hindu and not an independent religion”.  If Siddaramaiah has been embarrassed at the disclosure that the Congress-led UPA had itself turned down the demand for a separate religion for Lingayats, he has not been showing it. He is hoping that the “perception” that his government did its best for Lingayats will bring his party the electoral dividends. The state BJP, which has been treading cautiously on the issue so far, may try to turn the tables on Siddaramaiah by accusing him of dividing the Hindus. There is already a lot of anger and confusion among the Lingayats and they are worried that even families are being torn asunder. “I have been happily married for over 30 years and after this controversy broke, we are suddenly made to realise that my wife is a Veerashaiva and I’m a Lingayat. Why are we made to go through this agony?” a Lingayat professor wrote. “Over 90% of Veerashaivas and Lingayats are confused. The politics of the country has bombed a peace-loving community,” another social worker claimed. The BJP is bound to exploit such sentiments. Ultimately, the political churning in the Lingayat community over the next six-seven weeks will decide whether Siddaramaiah-led Congress will harvest a bumper crop of votes or a boomerang.",2018-03-24,, Siddaramaiah's great Lingayat gamble: Will it work | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/siddaramaiah-s-great-lingayat-gamble-will-it-work-104592.html
413,Akash Bisht,"Reminiscent of the previously held Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat, the elections for one seat in Uttar Pradesh went down to the wire with BJP winning the seat after counting of second preference votes. BJP's masterstroke of fielding an extra candidate, Anil Aggarwal, for the 10 seats in the fray paid handsome returns after the party went on to win the ninth seat which has dealt a major blow to the opposition bonhomie in the state. There was also last minute drama in Jharkhand, with the returning officer denying the election certificate to the victorious Congress candidate Dheeraj Sahu amidst allegations that he was acting under pressure. The elections for the 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh was full of dramatic twists amidst reports of cross voting, delay in counting and votes being deemed invalid by the Election Commission. This victory has come a massive morale booster for the BJP that faced an embarrassing defeat at the hands of SP-  combine in the recently held Lok Sabha bye-polls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur. These two seats were vacated by UP chief minister   and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya respectively. Having turned these elections into a prestige issue, BJP used all tricks to usurp a victory and deny BSP's BR Ambedkar from winning the ninth seat. If Ambdekar would have won, it could have sealed the deal of an alliance between SP, BSP and Congress in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. It remains to be seen whether BJP's victory has dealt a blow to this new found bonhomie between the two arch rivals or if has further strengthened it. Despite the setback, the Opposition could take comfort from the fact that there was no cross voting from the  's side, besides Naresh Agrawal's son, Nitin Agrawal which was only to be expected after the father-son duo's defection to the BJP. The Congress, too, cast its votes entirely in favour of the BSP candidate. The only other defections came from BSP MLA Anil Singh and the sole Nishad Party MLA. In UP, BJP was expected to win eight on the 10 seats with SP assured of bagging one seat for party candidate Jaya Bachchan. According to a deal struck earlier, SP and Congress had decided to vote in favour of BSP candidate and if it wasn't for BJP's ninth candidate, Ambedkar would have easily sailed into the upper house. However, BJP thwarted their plans and yet again put to use all its trickery to ensure a victory for its candidate. The defection of Singh and Agrawal was just the beginning in the series of dramatic twists that kept everyone guessing. Once the two parties realised that their legislator had indulged in cross voting, they approached the Election Commission claiming that their votes be declared invalid since they did not show it to the polling agent. This led to counting of votes being stopped for some time. Thereafter, the EC examined the CCTV footage of the two legislators casting their vote and realised that the duo did falter in adhering to the voting process leading to their votes being deemed invalid. Though even this didn't help the Opposition win, it must have given them solace on how they managed to get the two votes invalidated. Once the crisis was resolved, counting resumed and it was later announced that BJP's Anil Aggarwal had defeated Ambedkar. Reports suggest that Ambedkar got only 32 votes, five short of the required 37 votes, while Aggarwal got 16 votes in the first round. This led to EC counting of second preference votes which threw Aggarwal as a clear winner. Among those who won along with Aggarwal from UP included Union finance minister  , Ashok Bajpai, Vijaya Pal Singh Tomar, Sakal Deep Rajbhar, Kanta Kardam, Anil Jain, Harnath Singh Yadav and GVL Narsimha Rao. Meanwhile, elections for the Upper House were held for 25 seats in six states which were nearly as dramatic as the one witnessed in UP with counting being stopped in some states after various parties approached the EC over objections in ballot papers. Once the final results were declared, BJP managed to win 28 of the 59 seats that went to polls. For the 59 seats that fell vacant, 33 candidates, including several Union ministers, from 10 states were elected unopposed leaving 26 seats for which polling began on Friday morning. These 26 seats included 10 from UP, five from Bengal, four from Karnataka, three from Telangana, two from Jharkhand and one each from Kerala and Chhattisgarh. Apart from these, those elected unanimously include candidates from Gujarat, Maharashtra, MP, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand. . BJP's decision to field extra candidates in states where it was a close contest added much spice to these otherwise routine biennial elections. In fact, counting was stopped in Jharkhand and Karnataka after political parties raised objections to certain individuals not adhering to the due process ascribed by the poll body. In Jharkhand, the drama continued late into the night with Congress leaders headling to the Chief Election Commissioner's residence to complain against the return officer's alleged refusal to grant the certificate to its winning candidate. BJP has every reasons to be elated with its performance but so should Congress that managed to present a united front across these states. In fact, not one Congress leader indulged in cross voting which should make newly elected party president   proud. Not so long ago, Congress legislators were considered first to fall in BJP's trap whenever such situation arose with Gujarat being a perfect example of it. The Grand Old Party put up a solid display considering it won three of the four seats in Karnataka and one seat in Jharkhand largely because of its regional partners in the state. Full of suspense and charges of horse trading, elections in Jharkhand led to both BJP and Congress winning one seat each. Here too, BJP decided to field an extra candidate despite having no wherewithal to ensure his victory. In the house of 80, BJP's Samir Oraon secured 27 votes while Congress' Dhiraj Sahu managed to secure a berth for the Upper House. With a total tally of 43 legislators, BJP forced the elections after it named a second candidate despite being aware of 27 votes needed to win one seat. Congress with six MLAs was banking on support of JMM (18), JVM (2) and support of independents and other regional parties. Like other states, elections in Jharkhand were not bereft of charges of horsetrading and it gathered steam after JVM MLA Prakash Ram cast his vote and did not show it to the party's polling agent. Thereafter, JVM president Babulal Marandi expelled Ram from the party for six years and asked EC to not count his vote. Results from Karnataka too must have given Congress enough reasons to smile considering the party won three of the four seats that went to polls. In Karnataka, Congress turned the tables after it managed to secure votes of some JD(S) MLAs and independents that led to victory of its third candidate. The party had the numbers to win two seats but backroom negotiations with JD (S) legislators led to seven of them voting in favour of Congress. In fact, JD (S) even boycotted the polls claiming electoral malpractices which led to two votes being deemed invalid and two being rejected. After counting, Congress's Dr L Hanumanthaiah, Dr Syed Naseer Hussain and GC Chandrasekhar and BJP's Rajeev Chandrashekar were declared winners amidst delay in counting of votes. Meanwhile, the results from West Bengal were on expected lines as the Trinamool Congress went on to win four of the five seats on offer while ensuring victory for Congress' Abhishek Manu Singhvi for the remaining seat. Each candidate in the state needed 50 votes to secure a seat in the upper house. While Trinamool polled 200 votes for its four candidates, it was left with 13 extra votes which were transferred to Singhvi who needed six more votes to win. Congress has 44 legislators in the state. In Chhatisgarh, 49-year-old Saroj Pandey secured a Rajya Sabha berth after she polled 51 votes while Congress candidate Lekhram Sahu managed only 36 votes. To win, a candidate needed 46 votes and since BJP has 49 members in the 90-member assembly, her victory was a foregone conclusion. Interestingly, 51 MLAs voted in fovaor of Pandey including that of an independent and BSP legislator. Meanwhile, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi went on to win all three seats from the state with B Prakash, J Santosh Kumar and AB Lingaiah Yadav being elected to the Upper House. In Kerala,   leader MP Veerendra Kumar won with 89 votes while his opponent and Congress' D Babu Prasad managed only 40 votes. Overall, both Congress and BJP will take positives from these elections. While BJP has been able to exact revenge of its recent defeats in UP, Congress managed to punch above its weight and managed to win two more seats than it expected. For the Congress, Friday's results offer them hope in Karnataka whioch goes to polls later this year, while new alliances in Jharkhand will certainly give boost to its efforts of creating a united opposition against BJP in 2019. As far as the Rajya Sabha is concerned, BJP is now the largest party in the Upper House though still short of the majority mark. Winning 28 of the 59 seats will give a huge boost to the party which recently suffered a major setback after TDP walked out of the NDA with six of its MPs. Despite these results, BJP would still find it increasingly difficult to carry out its legislative agenda in the House.",2018-03-23,, Rajya Sabha polls: Enough to cheer for both BJP & Congress even amid late night drama | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/rajya-sabha-polls-enough-to-cheer-for-both-bjp-congress-even-amid-late-night-drama-104473.html
414,Akash Bisht,"The political circle was still not done analysing the election results in the Tipura, Nagaland and Meghalaya when Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu dropped a bomb by withdrawing the two Telugu Desam Party ministers from the Centre. The focus quickly shifted to the demand for special status for the southern status, which was split in 2014 to form Telangana. The split had been a highly imotive issue that was demonstrated by the way the Congress was decimated in elections then. While Naidu's TDP, allied with the  , made a killing at the hustings, Jaganmohan Reddy's Yuvajana Shramika Ryuthu Congress Party kept its share of the pie with six of the state's 25 Lok Sabha seats. It also emerged as the chief Opposition party in the state Assembly despite a slew of corruption cases against Reddy, the son of former chief minister YSR Reddy. On hindsight, his decision to split from the Congress paid off and now the party is back in focus with political turmoil reemerging in the state. Catch spoke to Midhun reddy, a prominent parliamentarian from YSRCP over Naidu's deicison, special status and what lies ahead. Edited excerpts: A: It is a classic case of posturing in the wake of the upcoming Assembly elections in the state. Since the TDP has gone back on all its promises, it just want to blame the BJP and quit the alliance. Chandrababu Naidu is trying to drag this till the end because he is scared he might get into trouble being with the NDA. He is under tremendous pressure back home. The YSRCP has been mobilising support over 'special category status' for the last four years. Now, Naidu has realised that people have understood that he isn't serious about it. Earlier, he would say that the special package was good and if you would talk about special status he would threaten to jail you.  Since public pressure mounted on him, he made a U-turn. All educated people are inclined towards special status. Now he wants to put the blame on the BJP so that only it suffers from the anti-incumbency.  Anyway, what difference does it make if two junior ministers resign? Only if they resign as members of Parliament and go for byelections, it would pressure the government.  Take the case of Rajasthan: just after the BJP lost the by-polls, it announced loan waiver. Would it have done so if it would have won with a huge margin? Everybody, including the finance minister, has been misguiding us. See, the Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act, passed in the house, is different from the special category status.  This package they are talking about is part of the Act. Two things were promised. They are just picking up things from the Act and saying this is the package.  Currently, the state is in such a financial mess considering that the debt on Andhra Pradesh since Independence stood at Rs 90,000 crore and in these 3.5 years it has increased by Rs 1.3 lakh crore. If it goes on like this then we will have even more debt considering we still don't have a state Capital. Yes. All revenue that united Andhra generated was from in and around Hyderabad. People fancied Hyderabad so much that they didn't develop other cities. All development was concentrated there. So, when the state split, Telangana became a surplus state while Andhra suffered.  There is no state capital; if you go there (Amaravati), there is just a board and large swathes of empty land. Why would anyone come there to invest or live? In four years nothing happened. they gave Rs 2,500 crore for the capital, the chief minister did nothng except displaying graphics.  Look at the Bengaluru Vidhan Sabha; it was built in just three years. Naidu has wasted four years. He took land from farmers without paying them a penny and called it 'land-pooling'. These farmers are in distress now because as they can't farm. It's a mega scam: all the land surrounding the capital belongs to Naidu and his party men. We have already declared that on 6 April our Parliamentarins will resign and seek re-election on the issue of special status vs special package. Then Naidu will know. Why should his ministers resign? He wants to put pressure, but will the resignation of only two ministers make any difference?  We also said “Let's all fight together. Let us put politics apart and ask all 25 MPs to resign.” Just imagine that there were by-elections and the BJP got a drubbing – it woul be disastrous for its 2019 plans.  The support we are getting for infrastructure development is not enough. We might need a similar package next year. Then again we will have to go go beg whosoever is in power. If we get special status, industries will come and we won't have to beg each year. Why should we run after them? We have clearly said any party that supports our demand would get our support. Let Mamta didi come or let Left Front form the government and we will support them if they help us with special category status. We are not bothered with national politics. We are interested only in the special status.  We will not enter any pre-poll alliance, but support any party who can take our agenda forward. Only if they are in that situation. but it is unlikely. At her peak   offered Reddy a central berth and asked him to not leave the Congress. He still did and hence the cases. Reddy knew he would be harassed. It's just vindictive politics. It is almost like arresting Rajeev Gandhi for allegations against Rajiv Gandhi in the Bofors case. In most of the cases, the court has adjudged that the officers, ministers and industrialists named were not involved. How is it that then only Reddy was in the wrong? He never signed anything, but was jailed.  Look at Naidu: his voice is on record, trying to buy one of our legislators. All channels aired it where he could be heard asking the MLA to “be free in asking what you want”. That was three years ago, but nothing happened. How is the chief minister above law?    This is also a reason why he is not quitting the NDA – there are lots of corruption cases against him. Probably, because it thinks that in the number game, Andhra is negligible.  Also, if they give us the status, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Odisha might get upset lots of industries will shift to Andhra if there are benefits. Our huge coastline makes us conducive for business. But these are poll-bound states it wants to win. In Tamil Nadu it doesn't have much of a stake but they are a strongest Opposition in Odisha and Karnataka. Even in West Bengal it is giving a tough run to the Trinamool Congress. We want to win at least 20 of Andhra's 25 Lok Sabha seats to be in a position to bargain. If you look at the 2014 elections, the BJP with the Modi wave, the TDP and actor Pawan Kalyan were all there; still their vote share was just 1.2% more than ours. The difference of all votes polled was only about 5 lakh. They have gone back one every promise and we want to exploit that. Our tenure ends on 4 June, 2019. That' 15 months away. For more than a year's time frame, the Election Commission has to announce by-polls. We have been raising this issue for long. But with only six Mps, it was not projected well enough at the national level. But we have won the perception battle in the state.  Well, he wouldn't have been arrested. But electorally, we would have sunk with the Congress. People are still angry with the party for splitting the state. We will play a key role at the Center, considering the BJP will not be as strong as it is. I don't think it will have an absolute majority.  We will certainly play a role.

415,News Agencies,"The NIA has summoned former Nagaland Chief Minister T R Zeliang for questioning in connection with an alleged ""tax collection and terror funding"" case, an official said on Monday. The case pertains to alleged extortion by groups such as NSCN(K), NSCN(IM) and Naga National Council from at least 14 government departments. Zeliang has been asked to appear at the National Investigation Agency headquarters here on Tuesday with relevant documents. Ahead of the Assembly election in the state, the NIA had summoned Zeliang's Officer on Special Duty and two of his office staff for questioning in connection with the alleged terror funding case. Also Read:  On January 18, 2017, the NIA had conducted searches in various government departments in Nagaland and seized receipts that showed payments to the tune of Rs 2 crore. The agency had said that these seizures prima facie indicate the connivance of these government organisations in funding various underground organisations operating in Nagaland. According to sources, these departments include the Directorate of Information Technology, Directorate of Soil and Water Conservation, Directorate of Irrigation, Directorate of Rural Development, Directorate of Urban Development, PWD, Roads and Buildings, and Directorate of Information and Public Relations. S. Khetoshe Sumi, a senior cadre of NSCN(K), was apprehended by the Assam Rifles in Dimapur on July 31, 2016, according to the NIA. Sumi reportedly revealed that he was the organisation's ""in-charge of finance"" and his key responsibility was to collect funds through illegal taxation of various government departments, the NIA said. The NIA probe into government workers and underground funding is a sensitive subject in Nagaland. In November 2017, massive protests rocked Kohima after seven government officials were reportedly arrested for funding underground groups, called Naga National Political Groups, through taxation. -- Also Read: ",2018-03-12,"National Investigation Agency,T R Zeliang,Nagaland,nia,Former Nagaland Chief Minister T R Zeliang", NIA summons ex-Nagaland Chief Minister T R Zeliang in 'terror funding' case | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/nia-summons-ex-nagaland-chief-minister-t-r-zeliang-in-terror-funding-case-102605.html
416,Rajeev Khanna,"After a year of turmoil that followed its drubbing in the Punjab Assembly polls, the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) has started making right kind of noises once again. The year that followed its loss was mostly non-productive for the party in political terms although it did try to take credit for the ouster of cabinet minister Rana Gurjit Singh over the sand mining scandal. Other than this, the party fared poorly in the by-polls and civic body elections. The period also saw several structural changes within the organisation but nothing much was visible on the ground. But in the last 15 days there have been signals that AAP might be getting its act together once again. It is a well known fact that for AAP, the strategy that has worked best is its hyper local movements. It is through issues at local level that the party was able to establish a direct connect with the masses and this was paying off well till the time the internal bickering started taking its toll as some of the leaders grew too ambitious ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls. AAP has got good response whenever it has raised issues that directly concern the people - mainly farmers, women and the students. With just a year to go for the next parliamentary polls, the party will have to hit the ground once again to recapture its lost support base if it wants to not only retain its four seats in the state but also try to get some more. It was interesting to see party's co-president in Punjab, Aman Arora, who is also Sunam MLA writing a letter to the Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh to share the concern of a class 12 student Manpreet Kaur who was depressed and demoralised as she could not attempt her board exam properly due to the blaring sound that came first from a wedding celebration, then a 'Jagran' and finally from the early morning sermons of the local Gurudwara. “ I despite fully being aware that when it comes to religion and faith, our social and political structure is ultra fragile and oversensitive, and raising them may not be good for any political person, but still I feel it to be my primary duty to raise this all important issue. I know that flagging the issue may not go down well with a few, but we'll all have to understand that as written in Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji education is the only way to enlighten, strengthen and empower the mankind,” the letter read. The writer asked the government to do the needful to restrict playing of loudspeakers at religious functions like 'Jagrans', temples and Gurudwaras along with social events like weddings etc beyond permissible limits, at least during the examination days of students. Now this is something which is of major concern to a large section of the population, particularly students, the aged and the sick. Despite laws in place to address these concerns no one dares to complain and even if one does there is reluctance on the part of the law enforcing agencies. AAP has shown the courage to raise the issue with the government. After this step, Arora sent across another popular signal on the International Women's day on March 8. He chose to celebrate the day in a different way by laying the foundation stone of a washroom in girls’ school at village Dhadrian of his constituency. The school had no washroom and the girl students were forced to go out in the fields or to use the washroom of neighboring houses. He pointed, “The women in India and abroad have a glorious past and all the religious texts give utmost place to the women. It is our duty to provide respect and security to the girls who are the future of this country.” He disclosed that a few days ago during a meeting with some NRI families, he had urged them to help in building washrooms in the girls’ schools where there were none. or were in a bad state. A couple of NRI families immediately agreed to provide financial help. “This is the beginning of the mission and washrooms in all the schools of Sunam constituency will be built in next one or two months,” he said. This has been followed up with the party coming out in support of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and computer teachers of the state. AAP has announced to raise the issue in forthcoming Budget session of the state assembly. In a joint statement, AAP's state president Bhagwant Mann and Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira along with others said that the the representatives of the different teachers unions submitted memorandum to the party and it came to light how the government is harassing the teachers and is planning to cut short their salaries. Mann said that just like the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-  (BJP) government, the Congress regime is also destroying the education system in the state. He said that he will request the Lok Sabha speaker to ask Punjab government to implement   Model of school education in the state as she did by passing the words to the Madhya Pradesh government. Besides raising these people centric issues, the party has also been attacking the government on the issue of rampant illegal mining and 'Goonda Tax'. Khaira has been the most vocal opposition leader on this issue. His repeated barbs at the Congress leadership including Amarinder has forced the Congress to launch a counter attack on him. The Congress leaders have issues a statement recently asking him to put his own house in order before commenting on the functioning of the government. “When Khaira should be introspecting about the decimation of his party, a fact admitted by   (party in-charge for Punjab), he was trying to poke his nose elsewhere,” said Congress leaders Harminder Singh Gill, Ramanjit Singh Sikki and Bawa Henry as they accused Khaira of trying to deflect the attention from his own failures. They criticised Khaira for trying to find fault in everything that the government does. With the masses still angry with the SAD-BJP combine over its failure to do anything in their decade long stint and their disillusionment growing with the Amarinder-led Congress regime, there is wide fertile field still available for AAP to capitalise upon. What remains to be seen is whether the party can seize this opportunity ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.",2018-03-12,, AAP is making all the right noises in Punjab.

417,News Agencies,"The opposition, led by Leader of Opposition Takam Pario walked out of the state assembly in Arunachal Pradesh late on Monday night (March 12), charging the government of Chief Minister Pema Khandu with being voiceless and ineffective. Prior to its walk out, the opposition walked into the Well of the House to protest. It was the first time an incident of this nature has happened in the political history of Arunachal Pradesh. The opposition was voicing its dissent over the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the state government and the Education Development Corporation of India Ltd. (EDCIL) to set up 1500 smart classes in secondary and higher secondary schools at a cost of Rs.30 crore under the Chief Minister's Adhunik Sikshya Yojana programme. Also Read:  While the state government maintained that the MoU was aimed at bridging the existing gap in the education sector, the opposition questioned the need for signing a MoU on the day of the presentation of the state budget on March 10. Pario and another opposition lawmaker Nikh Kaim asked Chief Minister Khandu and the treasury benches, ""Does it not mean that you had already planned before the budget?"". Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein, however, defended the move, saying that the signing of a MoU was permissible as per budgetary provisions. Also Read:  Chowna Mein expressed regret over the opposition disruption of proceedings. He said that government is only keen on presenting a pro-poor and pro-farmer budget, besides offering quality education to students across the state. Pario had earlier walked into the well of the house Nikh Kamin and Tanga Byaling shouting slogans like ""nehi hoga, nehi hoga (not possible, not possible)"". Repeated pleas by the Speaker and the chief minister to allow assembly proceedings to continue failed to cut ice with the opposition. ""If you continue to resort to corruption, we can't sit silent,"" Pario said. while Chowna Mein continued to present the budget. ""Funds should be distributed equally in each assembly constituency. Arunachal ko sudharo, bachao (Improve and save Arunachal)! Assurances are given on the floor, but schemes are given to individuals only. Eh chitingbaji se kaam nehi chalega. (Such cheating cannot be allowed). How can a government run like this?,"" Pario said, when marshals of the assembly switched off the microphones of opposition members. However, they continued to thump their desks and shouting slogans. Also Read:  Byaling said, ""When there is no equal fund distribution, there is no democracy. Is this North Korea? When Kamin asked: ""Does Opposition have any role? Is this government pro-people or anti-people? he asked the speaker.

""The opposition will support all good works of the government, but they must be free from corruption. Every member has equal rights in the house. The allocation to each assembly should be made public. Why party baji only"", Kamin questioned. Kamin said, ""If we don't demand here, where we will demand? The government is for the public. If the public has no rights, where do they go? Is this democracy when the opposition is not allowed to speak? We all are elected like the treasury bench members. Aaj tak jati pati se tribal-state Arunachal mein bhed bhav nehi hua tha (There was no distinction on caste line in this tribal state so far). What type of government is this? Where is the Team Arunachal spirit?"", Kamin asked. Tado demanded that on what grounds was smart class execution being given to EDCIL? The opposition termed the MoU a clear case of corruption and said it was not even invited for pre-budget consultations on the issue. It claimed that the state government has made life a living hell for all in Arunachal Pradesh. The state budget, however, was presented. The 2017-18 budget of Rs. 19,261 crore has a deficit of Rs. 546 crore. The 2016-17 budget had an initial deficit of Rs. 689 crore, which was reduced to Rs. 673 crore.

420,Akash Bisht,"The last day of filing nominations for Rajya Sabha witnessed huge drama in Gujarat over the validity of nomination papers of Congress candidate Naranbhai Rathwa. Confusion over Rathwa's nomination papers forced Congress to field retired IAS officer and Dalit leader PK Valera as an independent candidate in case his nomination papers are invalidated during scrutiny. There were also reports of Rajeev Shukla being rushed to Gandhinagar to replace Rathwa if his papers are rejected. Earlier on Sunday, Congress announced the names of candidates for the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls due to be held on 23 March. Congress has fielded two candidates – Rathwa and Dr Amee Yajnik – as its nominees from the western state. However, on Monday, there were reports that Rathwa did not have a no objection certificate which fueled rumors of his nomination being rejected. Thereafter, reports suggested that Congress president   asked Shukla to rush to Gandhinagar to file his nomination, which didn't materialise. The deadline for filing the nomination was 3 pm and there was no way that Shukla could have made it to Gandhinagar on such short notice. Quoting a senior Airport Authority of India official, Desh Gujarat claimed that permission was sought for landing his aircraft which was denied.  Meanwhile, Rathwa, a tribal leader and a five time MP from Chota Udaipur, did file his nomination and swore an oath before the Returning Officer in the nick of time to save further embarrassment to the party. Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia dismissed reports of Shukla being considered as Rathwa's replacement. “Rathwa had a bungalow in his name when he was a minister in UPA 1. However, in 2009, he obtained a NoC for the same. However, someone suggested that he should have a NoC procured recently which led to the confusion. Rathwa consulted senior lawyers and once they were convinced, he filed his nomination,” said Modhwadia. He went on to add that it is for this reason that Congress decided to field Valera as an independent candidate to ensure that the party does not lose out on a Rajya Sabha seat from the state. “No one knows who spread these rumors of Shukla being rushed to Gandhinagar. We had no such communication from the high command,” he added. Modhwadia pointed that the confusion over Rathwa's papers also led to BJP sensing an opportunity to win one more seat which led to the saffron party fielding an independent candidate. With 78 MLAs in Gujarat Assembly, Congress is sure of winning two seats since each candidate needs 37 votes to be elected to the Upper House. Similarly, BJP too will send two of its candidates to the Upper House and would still be left with 26 surplus votes. Sources say that BJP could try and repeat the high voltage drama witnessed during senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel's election to Rajya Sabha in 2017. Modhwadia, however, stressed that such a situation would not arise and said that Congress is united unlike how it was in 2017. According to local reports, Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitin Patel claimed that internal groupism within the Congress led to the chaos. He went on to add that there is possibility of rebellion and cross voting in Congress which was the reason why the ruling party fielded a third candidate. Meanwhile, a total of eight candidates have filed nomination for four seats that fall vacant on 2 April. BJP and Congress have fielded three and two candidates respectively while three candidates have filed nominations as independents. BJP has earlier announced names of Parshottam Rupala and Mansukh Mandavia as its candidates for the two seats which it is sure of wining. Both these candidates are ministers in the Central government and also members of the Upper House. The scrutiny of papers would be done on 15 March which will also shed light on whether Rathwa's nomination gets rejected. On Sunday, Congress has announced the names of 10 candidates for the upcoming biennial elections in the seven states. While the names of most of the candidates was almost a certainty, it was journalist Kumar Ketkar's candidature from Maharashtra that surprised many. Among others, Congress nominated Dhiraj Prasad Sahu from Jharkhand, Dalit poet L Hanumanthaiah, Vokkalinga leader GC Chandrasekhar and Syed Naseer Hussain from poll-bound Karnataka. While the party is expected to win two seats and needs few extra votes to secure a third seat from the southern state.

424,Riyaz Wani,"One, regarding Drabu’s own political career. It needs to be seen whether he will wait for his rehabilitation or choose to confront his party over the decision. But if the past is any guide, there is not much that Drabu can do about it. Earlier in 2006, when the PDP-Congress coalition ruled the state, senior PDP leader and the then Finance Minister Muzaffar Hussain Beigh had been sacked in similar circumstances. Once powerful Beigh is still in the party but lost in the wilderness.   Second, regarding the BJP-PDP alliance. The BJP has publicly opposed Drabu’s sacking and defended his speech. But this is more reflective of the ideological divergence between the coalition partners than a fundamental difference of opinion over Dabu’s exit that could trigger the break-up of the alliance.   Third, regarding Mehbooba Mufti's own position. Here, Mehbooba is on a very firm wicket. By sacking Drabu, she has played to her core constituency in the Valley. Drabu’s reported characterisation of the problem in Kashmir “as a society with social issues” had sparked outrage, with people terming it as yet another instance of the PDP’s ultimate surrender to the BJP and the Sangh Parivar.   Drabu’s sacking, therefore, can be seen as Mehbooba’s ideological reassertion. And the dramatic nature of the decision will go some way to compensate for her perceived political subservience to the agenda of the BJP. Also, by sacking one of the most powerful ministers, the CM has further consolidated her grip on the party. And for the figures like Drabu and those before him like Beigh who can boast of the personal profiles beyond the one conferred on them by their parties and therefore see themselves indispensable, Kashmir is a sobering place.   “Politics in Kashmir is delicately nuanced and critically balanced,” wrote senior journalist Mohammad Sayeed Malik in his analytical piece on the development in a local paper. “Men and matters must equate to its exacting standards or perish”.        In 2014, days after the PDP emerged the largest single party in the state Assembly polls with 28 seats, its erstwhile patron Mufti Muhammad Sayeed deputed Haseeb Drabu to work out the contours of a possible alliance with the BJP. Thereafter, Drabu worked with BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav to formulate the Agenda of Alliance that became the basis of a coalition between the two ideologically divergent parties, the so-called “North and South Pole"" of Jammu and Kashmir politics. Drabu, a noted economist and a former editor of  , was predictably made the finance minister. He retained the all-important post even after the sudden death of Mufti and the takeover of his daughter   as the new J&K CM. But on Monday, Mehbooba sacked him as finance minister for calling Kashmir a “social” rather than a “political” issue during his speech at a function organised by PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry in New Delhi. The move took the state by surprise. Drabu had substantially gained in political stature over the past four years as a leading member of the PDP-BJP coalition. Along with CM Mehbooba, he was the PDP's only nationally known figure. What is more, he has also been the architect of self-rule, the party's own formula for the settlement of Kashmir in its external and internal dimensions. The formula involves the radical constitutional restructuring of J&K relationship with New Delhi, dual currency, roll-back of central laws, an elected governor, even the renaming of the titles of governor and chief minister as Sadar-i-Riyasat (president) and the prime minister respectively. Now the same Drabu is in the dock for denying Kashmir issue its political dimension and defining the lingering turmoil in the state as a social issue. For the party, the finance minister had thus crossed the ideological redline by saying what he did. Already on the defensive over its inability to take on the BJP over the latter’s implicit and explicit support to the accused in the rape and murder of a 8-year old girl in Jammu and for not getting its way with the FIR against an Army officer allegedly responsible for killing three civilians in Shopian, PDP couldn’t afford to be seen to have even ideologically aligned itself with the Sangh Parivar. Hence the drastic decision to relieve Drabu of his job. This is a move that has created a new imponderable for the J&K coalition, already reeling under a mounting weight of its irreconcilable contradictions. The BJP has hardly helped the matters by rallying to a staunch defence of Drabu. The saffron party has called him the “key pointsman in setting the terms of alliance” and termed his sacking from the Cabinet as “a setback” to the coalition. “What Drabu said is right. Kashmir is a social problem, not a political issue,” said a BJP leader. Sajad Lone, a key BJP ally in the government said, that Drabu had been ""brutally"" quoted out of context. But the knives were already out within the PDP. The party's Vice President Sartaj Madni asked Drabu to retract his statement “if it had been incorrectly reported in the media”. The party's disciplinary panel head Abdur Rahman Veeri asked him to explain the statement attributed to him on the Kashmir issue. “Your statement has the potential of creating a serious dent in the image and credibility of the party,” Veeri said. “Therefore you are advised to explain as to why a statement detrimental to the party interests was made”. But no response from Drabu followed. Following day, the CM Mehbooba wrote to Governor NN Vohra that Drabu was no more in the Cabinet.    ",2018-03-13,," Drabu sacked: It's advantage Mehbooba, but there's no threat to PDP-BJP alliance | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/drabu-sacked-it-s-advantage-mehbooba-but-there-s-no-threat-to-pdp-bjp-alliance-102822.html

426,News Agencies,"Counting of votes for by-elections in Araria Lok Sabha seat and Bhabua and Jehanabad Assembly constituencies in Bihar began amid tight security today, officials said. The by-election for the Araria seat was necessitated by the death of RJD MP Mohd Taslimuddin. The contest is mainly between RJD's Sarafaraz Alam, Taslimuddin's son, and BJP's Pradip Singh, who had won the seat in 2009 and lost in 2014. In Jehanabad, the RJD hopes to retain the Assembly seat that fell vacant after the death of Mundrika Yadav. The party gave a ticket to Yadav's son Kumar Krishna Mohan. The BJP is hopeful of retaining the Bhabhua Assembly seat riding on a sympathy wave for Anand Bhushan Pandey whose death at the age of 48 necessitated the bypoll. The saffron party fielded Pandey's wife Rinky Rani. This is the first electoral battle in the state since Chief Minister  , who also heads the JD(U), walked out of the alliance with the RJD and the Congress and joined the BJP-led NDA last year. -- Read More On Catch: ",2018-03-14,"Bihar,bypoll,BJP,araria,Jehanabad,Bhabua"," Bihar bypoll: BJP leading in Araria, Bhabua; RJD in Jehanabad | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/bihar-bypoll-bjp-leading-in-araria-bhabua-rjd-in-jehanabad-102856.html

428,Charu Kartikeya,"RJD's candidate Sarfaraz Alam was headed for a huge victory in Araria Lok Sabha constituency. The seat had fallen vacant after the death of his father Mohammad Taslimuddin, who was the area's long-serving RJD MP and local heavyweight. Before the by-polls, Alam was a JD(U) MLA and joined his father's party just a month ahead of the by-polls. Alam has had a checkered past, having been suspended from JD(U) over charges of molesting a couple on a train. However, his victory will come as a boost for RJD, against the background of party supremo   being in jail and the party having just lost power in the state because of Nitish Kumar's switch. This victory will also be seen in continuation with two other Lok Sabha by-polls that were held in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, which too the BJP lost. The   won both UP seats, with a sympathetic push from the  . The Araria result will also come as a certificate of leadership for Lalu's son and former Deputy CM,  . Tejashwi was the ostensible reason Kumar had held responsible behind his decision to jettison the Grand Alliance and return to the NDA. Tejashwi has since then become a vocal critic of Kumar, challenging the latter's governance and his politics from within the state assembly as well as from multiple fora outside. That the party managed to retain its Parliamentary and assembly seats in such adverse conditions will come as a testimony to Tejashwi's ability to lead the party to electoral victory. RJD's Kumar Krishna Mohan won the Jehanabad assembly seat that was earlier held by his father, Mundrika Yadav. The taste of this victory would have turned sweeter for RJD because the last time it won the seat, it was in alliance with JD(U). The JD(U) is its rival now and the victory will come as a clear stamp of approval from the electorate for RJD and not the ruling party. Accepting well-deserved congratulations for both victories, Tejashwi was humble in his response, presenting the success as a consequence of the treatment meted out to his father.   He also took a dig at Prime Minister  , thanking him for setting off central probe agencies against him and several of his other relatives.     The RJD did not contest in Bhabua assembly constituency, but the results came as a dampener for the anti-BJP alliance. It was the Congress that had put up its candidate on the seat that had fallen vacant after the death of BJP's MLA Anand Bhushan Pandey. BJP fielded Pandey's wife Rinky Rani and she managed to retain the seat for the party. Conceding defeat on the other two seats, BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister   Modi said the results were an indicator of a sympathy wave. Many saw these by-polls as a crucial test for Tejashwi as well as Nitish and with the scales now tilted in the favour of the former, the CM will suffer a loss of face. These results have the potential of triggering another round of churn in Bihar's politics.  The results of by-polls in Bihar today may or may not be a verdict on Chief Minister  's decision to switch alliances overnight, but they will certainly come as a point of crisis for him.

430,Akash Bisht,"A new caste calculus in Uttar Pradesh has handed one of the most embarrassing defeats to BJP and its poster boy Chief Minister Yogi Adityanth in his own backyard. One-year-old Adityanath government suffered a major setback after SP-  combine won by-polls for the two Lok Sabha seats in Gorakhpur and Phulpur which fell vacant after the chief minister and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya resigned to take over responsibilities in the state government. The twin victories have come as a major embarrassment for Adityanath who has just finished one year in office and had represented Gorakhpur for five consecutive terms. The twin victories are likely to have far-reaching consequences considering it could see arch rivals SP and BSP joining hands during the 2019 General Elections to defeat the common enemy – BJP. Having failed to cobble up a similar understanding during the 2017 Assembly elections, the two parties gave up their differences to take on the BJP which was unprepared for such an eventuality. In fact, soon  after the dates for the by-polls were announced, BJP leaders were brimming with confidence on winning the two seats with considerable ease. However, their confidence came crashing down once BSP decided to lend its weight behind SP just few days before the polls. A panic-stricken BJP leadership had no answers to this caste calculus which saw the coming together of two regional powerhouses in India's most politically significant state in the country. In fact, UP was  crucial to Prime Minister  's emphatic win in 2014 where his party and its ally managed to win 73 out of the 80 seats on offer. However, the truce was not easy to come by and it took hectic parleys from the leaders of the two parties to come to an understanding and cobble up a winning formula. In fact, the bitter relations between the two parties started to thaw during the Budget Session of the UP Assembly in February when the two joined hands on multiple occasions to take on the Adityanath government over its handling of law and order and the spate of alleged fake encounters. “Leaders of the two parties would sit together and discuss issues that could help corner the BJP government. Slowly, we developed a bonhomie. Thereafter, our leadership began discussing the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections and we decided to support the BSP's candidate. One thing led to  another and eventually BSP decided to support our candidates for the by-polls,” said MLC Udaiveer Singh, who is particularly close to  . Being hailed as one of the architects of this alliance, Udaiveer was given the crucial responsibility of holding discussions with his party cadres and that of the BSP in Gorakhpur and Phulpur. The idea was to get a sense of how effective such an alliance could be. “When we were in power, there was little time to collect genuine feedback about candidates and possible alliances. However, after the defeat, we were  far more organised and began working towards adopting a strategy to defeat BJP,” he added. This strenuous process of consultations with local leaders led to SP zeroing down on candidates of certain caste groups who could tilt the balance in their favour. During his conversations with local leaders, he found that even BSP cadres too had a soft spot for SP. Udaiveer said, “They were tired of this horse trading business and how BJP was trying to finish their party by poaching local leaders. The voter and worker felt that these cosmetic damages by BJP were not healthy for democracy and their party. Once we shared the feedback with the BSP leadership, they too became interested in having some sort of understanding.” When questioned about the possibility of two parties chalking out a similar strategy during the 2019 polls, Udaiveer said how the twin victories have come as a shot in the arm for the two parties which could set the agenda for future. “We have nothing but respect for BSP whether this works out or not. Sometimes, one plus one is only two, sometimes could be 11. Sometimes it could also be zero. Today, it is 11. So, we have to work on many fronts before zeroing down on an alliance. However, it would be wise to come together if BJP has to be stopped.” Speaking on the bitter relations between the two parties, Udaiveer called it a thing of the past and even accepted how ego of their local level leadership added to the bitterness. “Netaji and Kanshiramji had no  such conflict. Cracks in our relations happened because of local contradictions and it can happen with anyone. It can happen within a party. However, it was BJP that hyped these differences and even made it personal because they knew if these two come together, they will be wiped out from the state.” Does this also meant wiping out of the Congress from the state as well? Udiaveer disagreed but questioned the rationale behind Congress contesting these elections. According to him, Congress had no stakes in the region and would have lost anyways. Blaming Congress' local  leadership for being removed from reality, he said, “I don't know what feedback they gave to their top leadership. It was certainly a wrong move. In 2017, they contested a seat from Gorakhpur with support  of SP and they should have realised where they stand,” he pointed. When asked whether the SP-BSP understanding has made the Congress irrelevant in the state, Udaiveer gave a measured response. He stressed that Congress still remains a force to reckon with and would  play a crucial role in dethroning Modi in 2019. However, he does have a suggestion for the Grand Old Party: “Let top leaders of the party communicate with others. Their mid-rung leaders do not share honest feedback. If they would have consulted us, we would have given them reasons for not contesting.” Elated with the victory, Udaiveer finds major takeaways from these results with the prominent one being how BJP has no answers to this new caste calculus in the state. “There is no way they can defeat this arithmetic. With four years still left to rule, BJP has lost polls in the constituencies of its chief minister and deputy chief minister despite having government at the Center and state. They had all the resources and star campaigners and yet they lost which speak volumes about our strategy. Earlier, they used to brag how there is not even one seat from where they can't win. Now, there is not even one seat from where they can win.” According to him, these elections have exposed BJP's doublespeak, particularly on Muslims. He claimed that it was the saffron party that prodded don Atiq Ahmad to contest as an independent from Phulpur to cut into SP's vote share. “Their main plank of anti-Muslim campaign was exposed. If Atiq was used for political gains, what are you telling your core voters? People are not fools, they now know the true colours of BJP and its  leadership. They can no longer use communalism to hide their failures.”",2018-03-14,, How a new caste calculus helped SP-BSP defeat BJP in Phulpur and Gorakhpur | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/how-a-new-caste-calculus-helped-sp-bsp-defeat-bjp-in-phulpur-and-gorakhpur-102981.html
431,Atul Chandra,"  Backed by the Bahujan Samaj Party ( ), the   (SP) dealt two massive blows to the ruling   by snatching the prestigious Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats in the by-elections. In Phulpur, the constituency from where Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had won by a huge margin, the SP candidate Nagendra Singh Patel was declared elected by 59,613 votes at the end of round 26. At the end of 27th round of counting in Gorakhpur the SP candidate Praveen Nishad was leading by 21, 127 votes against his BJP rival Upendra Shukla. Nishad’s lead has down from 25,870 votes in the 22nd round to 22,954 in the 22nd, making the BJP camp jubilant with hope. The seats fell vacant after Adityanath and Keshav Prasad Maurya were elected to the state Assembly. The scent of victory also brought   back into political reckoning and opened the possibility of a credible Opposition alliance to take on the BJP in the 2019 parliamentary elections. At both the places the Congress was not in contention. In fact Atiq Ahmad polled more votes (43,000) than the Congress candidate in Phulpur. The loss of Gorakhpur seat will personally hurt Chief Minister   as he was Gorakhpur MP for five consecutive terms. Adityanath’s guru Mahant Avaidyanath had held the seat earlier. This is the first time in three decades that the seat has gone outside the Gorakhnath Mutt, of which Adityanath is the Mahant, a position earlier occupied by Avaidyanath. The shocking defeat couldn’t have come at a worse time for Adityanath---just when he was preparing to celebrate his one year in office. Accepting the defeat, Maurya said that the party announced its candidates before the SP-BSP decided to come together for these polls. “We will now analyse the causes for defeat,” he said. The state BJP president blamed the defeat on low voter turnout. UP CM Yogi Adityanath also made a similar statement later that the BJP was over-confident and didn't anticipate the challenge that the SP-BSP alliance posed. The victor from Phulpur, Nagendra Patel, thanked   and Mayawati for his good showing. To acknowledge the BSP’s importance in these victories, Leader of Opposition in Vidhan Sabha, Ram Govind Chaudhary met Mayawati and thanked for her support to the SP. After the 1995 State Guest House incident Mayawati had decided not to have any alliance with the SP. It was only after Akhilesh Yadav marginalised his father   and took over as party president that a thaw became visible. Earlier, the district returning officer Rajeev Rautela drew the ire of media and the SP for allegedly trying to play dirty on behalf of the government. Rautela delayed the announcement of results of the initial rounds when after the ninth round he came out to inform journalists of the first round lead. As the House was in session, there was a furore and the SP fired a letter to the Election Commission drawing its attention to a possible foul play by Rautela. After that Rautela started giving details of votes counted after every round. The Election Commission has sought a report from Rautela on the complaint. Commenting on the leads, SP MLC Sunil Singh Yadav Sajan said it was a victory of saanp-chhachhundar (snake and a mole), referring to the snide remark made by Chief Minister Adityanath on the SP-BSP alliance. The Adityanath government has been facing criticism for its aggressive Hindutva, lack of development and police encounters. His arrogance and differences with Maurya were also to blame for the party’s pathetic showing in the by-elections. Ummed Singh, BSP spokesman, said we are not making any statement because of the death of BSP leader Lalji Verma's son. Verma's son committed suicide yesterday and ""Behenji and other party leaders were condoling the tragedy,"" he said.  ",2018-03-14,," Bua-Babua magic works: SP wins Phulpur, defeats BJP in Yogi's turf Gorakhpur | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bua-babua-magic-works-sp-wins-phulpur-defeats-bjp-in-yogi-s-turf-gorakhpur-102973.html

434,Akash Bisht,"Miffed with the Centre's reluctance to give Special Category Status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh, Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) has moved a no-confidence motion against the   government.  On 15 March, YV Subba Reddy – a member of Parliament from the party – moved the motion under Rule 198 (b) of Chapter XVII of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha wherein he mentioned: “I hereby give notice to move the following motion in the House on 16.03.2018. I request you to include the motion in the Revised List of Business for 16.03.2018.” In addition, YSRCP leader Jaganmohan Reddy has also made an appeal to all political parties to support his party's initiative on seeking SCS for the southern state.  “I write this letter with the right earnest to muster support from your party in our fight for justice and remind you that after the (Andhra Reorganisation) Bill was passed and Andhra was torn away separating it with Telangana with Hyderabad. The promises made by the central government and the assurances given on the floor of the Parliament during the debate were not kept. The residual state of Andhra Pradesh with all shortcomings and disadvantages it had to carry, had been under utter neglect.”  Reminding party leaders of former Prime Minister  's assurance of providing special status to the state, he goes on to add that it was ratified by all Opposition parties, including the   (BJP), back then.  He highlighted that back then BJP leader   had categorically requested for the grant of SCS for 10 years with the contention that five years would not be sufficient as setting up any industry itself would take three-four years and that benefits should be extended to a longer period.  In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while campaigning for the General Elections in the state, had promised SCS to Andhra for a period of 10 years to ensure sustained development and prosperity. Moreover, the promise of SCS was also included in the state manifesto of both the BJP and its ally Telgu Desam Party (TDP) as well. Jagan alleges that once the BJP managed to form the government, it tried to dilute the SCS issue and instead started talking about Special Financial Package with the “blessings of Chandrababu Naidu”. Further accusing the TDP of not pressurising the central government enough to push forward the SCS demand, Jagan listed various reasons in his letter for not giving Andhra SCS. He pointed how it was denied to the state following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission despite 11 other states receiving the status.  Accrording to him, two commission members – Abhijit Sen and M Govinda Rao – recently clarified in writing that it did not recommend abolition of SSC to any state. “Rather than looking for reasons to not give SCS, it is very important in democracy to honour the assurance given to the state on the floor of the House,” he wrote. Ever since Telangana, along with Hyderabad, was carved out of Andhra Pradesh, the state debt burden has reached a whooping sum of Rs 2.20 lakh crore. Jagan pointed that since Independence the state had accrued a debt of Rs 97,000 crore.  However, it shot up by an additional Rs 1.20 lakh crore since bifurcation which has put the state at a serious disadvantage. “With this level of debt and lack of industries, how can we survive without CCS,” he said.  According to Jaganmohan, since his party with six MPs has been unable to achieve SCS, they introduced a first ever no confidence motion against the central government. “In this backdrop, I request you to extend support for the cause and join us in chorus when we move the No Confidence motion on 21 March in the ongoing budget session,” he said while adding that if the government still doesn't pay heed to their demands, all YSRCP MPs would resign on 6 April.  Political parties in Andhra Pradesh have raised a banner of revolt against the central government over the SCS. In fact, last week, two TDP ministers even resigned from the central government in protest while their leader Chandrababu Naidu has been making stinging attacks on the government, particularly the Prime Minister, over SCS.  On 15 March, he even accused Modi of deploying the same tactics in Andhra as he did in Tamil Nadu where he pitted the OPS faction of   against the EPS faction, which eventually led to a split. He claimed that the prime minister was using YSRCP and Jana Sena's Pawan Kalyan against him in the state. He also claimed that a strong anti-BJP and anti-Modi feeling is gaining ground in the country which according to him also reflected in the by-poll results announced earlier.  Meanwhile, actor turned politician Kalyan too has backed Jaganmohan over his decision of a no-confidence motion against the government. Although, the no confidence motion in no way threatens the incumbent government, it is being seen as a way to send a message to voters in Andhra. Despite BJP's loss of three seats in UP and Bihar by-polls, the saffron party still has a comfortable majority with 272 members in the Lok Sabha since the majority mark has fallen to 269 due to vacancies created after death of two BJP MPs from Kairana and Palghar.

436,A Saye Sekhar,"Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is nursing two ambitions:  1) Playing an active role in the national political arena, and 2) Passing on the baton in the state to his son KT Rama Rao. It's more than a week since he announced his intent to foray into national politics with a strong desire to bring about a “qualitative change” in the polity and people’s lives. Though KCR himself claimed that some national leaders have hailed his idea, support hasn't been pouring in as much, at least, overtly. It isn't known whether he is in touch with some leaders worth their salt, already.  But the Chief Minister's Office has informed the media two days after his announcement that he would undertake a tour of important cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Bengaluru; hold parleys with social harbingers of social change and professionals and experts in various walks of life not only to enlist their support, but even to elicit their views on various issues impacting people's lives. KCR, chief of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), is a long-term player. He has a lot of political patience, thanks to Telangana agitation. A man who fought a protracted battle for 13 long years to realise his ambition of the formation of a separate Telangana State cannot be described as a man in a hurry.  So, he may take his time in embarking on his mission, 'Jai Bharat', a slogan that he concluded his address with on the second day of his announcement in front of a specially convened public meeting on the lawns of 'Pragathi Bhavan', the official residence of the Chief Minister. One interesting quality KCR has is that he wouldn't hesitate to admit mistakes. But he must feel the compunction and it cannot be externally taunted. If he does, he has no qualms about retracting. Fueled by confidence – for now it appears to be just a bravado – that there is a scope for the emergence of an alternative political conglomerate to the Congress and the BJP-led coalitions at the national level, KCR began to make the first steps. He actually is dreaming big and the haze around the seriousness of his objective to don the national mantle is slowly disappearing what with his repeated assertions. On Sunday, KCR chose the TRS legislature party meeting at the Telangana Bhavan, the party’s headquarters, as the platform to announce that he “would be here (in Hyderabad) until 2019 only. After that, I will play an active role in national politics.” KCR has always maintained that he has no problem with the BJP and Prime Minister  . Though he did not wax eloquent on Modi, he stretched to the extent of saying: “Indian politics are now in need of the TRS. Modi has developed Gujarat and then went to Delhi. Since I developed Telangana, my aim is to raise the banner at the national level. The idea of a national alternative hasn’t taken birth now.” What does he mean by this? Is it that just in case, his mission fails to achieve the desired result, would he be angling for a better negotiating power with Modi? For the record, KCR asserted that the Congress and the   (BJP) could make no difference to India in decades of their rule. KCR's idea of a fast-track growth and his grandiose plans to take a cue from China and Singapore models of development and willingness to amend the Constitution, if it warrants, signal his intent in bringing about a paradigm shift in politics and administration.  While he scored a few brownie points by proclaiming the “first-mover advantage” to spearhead the national alternative, which he refuses to call a ‘third front’ but as the ‘first front’, would he be able to cobble the diverse political formations will become interesting to watch. Another strong ambition he is nursing is to pass on the baton in the State to his son, KT Rama Rao. Whether the idea of playing a crucial role in national politics triggered the thought of creating a succession plan back home or is it the other way round is, however, not clear. But KCR has almost anointed his son KTR to be his successor. He has dropped ample hints to this extent at the TRS Legislature Party meeting.  “Rajya Sabha elections are very crucial. I am entrusting the responsibility to KTR. He will have to coordinate with Deputy Chief Minister Kadiyam Srihari, Finance Minister Etela Rajender and Power Minister K Jagadeesh Reddy. And the most important matter of the Assembly session will be managed by Legislative Affairs Minister Harish Rao.” By hinting that he would take “efficient leaders” along with him to Delhi, KCR literally cleared decks for his son to don the mantle here. For, KCR’s nephew and Irrigation Minister Harish Rao, a very senior leader in the TRS, is also a strong contender for the top job in Hyderabad. In fact, grooming the son for the big role has begun two years ago. KTR was given the onerous task of leading the party in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Elections (GHMC) in 2016. The TRS scored an overwhelming victory in those elections trouncing the Congress (two seats), the BJP (four) and the TDP (just one).  The TRS scored a whopping 99 out of 150, its ally All India Majlis-e-Ittehaadul Muslimeen won 44 in those elections. KTR also led the TRS to a victory in a byelection to Paleru Assembly seat in Khammam district. KCR’s heir apparent has systematically fortified his support base, independent of his father, by making use of the free hand given, across the state.  With 1.1 million twitter followers, KTR, who holds five important portfolios of Information Technology, Municipal Administration & Urban Development, Industries, Mines & Geology, Handlooms and Textiles, and NRI Affairs in KCR Government, is the most active politician on social media too. He is smart and affable when it comes to demonstrating sophistication – he moderated a session with Ivanka Trump, Cherry Blaire and Chanda Kocchar at Global Entrepreneurship Summit held towards the end of 2017 with great elan.  He is tough and rustic in striking a nativity cord and connecting with people when he addresses public meetings, which are a bright indication to his future role. He succeeded effortlessly in hogging the limelight when it comes to portraying himself as a leader with a humane heart. More often than not he demonstrates his humanitarian concerns to people by extending medical help or providing employment avenue or shelter to at least three cases that draw his attention through Twitter every day. He is highly active on the microblogging site and uses for taking political potshots, issuing administrative instructions etc. Does KTR have a plan of action to combat the growing opposition and high-decibel anti-establishment campaign by the Congress and the outfit led by Joint Action Committee leader Kodandaram is, however, a million-dollar question.",2018-03-14,, KCR is ambitious alright. But will he realise his dreams? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/kcr-is-ambitious-alright-but-will-he-realise-his-dreams-102970.html

438,Aditya Menon,"The row began even before Trudeau arrived in India. There was speculation that he would not meet Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh as the latter had refused to meet Canadian defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan during his visit to India last year. Captain had even gone to the extent of accusing Sajjan of being pro-separatist. Shekhar Gupta, the founder of  , went to the extent of suggesting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should scrap Trudeau's visit altogether. Just one day before Trudeau's arrival, Gupta tweeted: While Modi thankfully didn't take Gupta's advice, the PM did depart from his own practice of going to receive world leaders. Forget receiving Trudeau, Modi didn't even post a welcome Tweet. Almost on cue, the pro-BJP TV channels went on a nationalist frenzy, almost projecting Trudeau as being nothing less than a national enemy. What was worse is that the hostility towards the Canadian PM soon degenerated into hostility against Sikhs in general A Hindi news channel said, ""Nahin raas aaya Bharat ko Trudeau ka Sikh prem"" (India disapproves of Trudeau's love for Sikhs), sending the message that Canada's pro-Sikh approach is against India's national interests. Both English and Hindi channels portrayed Canadian Sikhs across the board as being pro-Khalistan and there were clear attempts to drive a wedge between Indian and diaspora Sikhs. Gupta struck again with an  , titled 'Trudeau has been as wrong about Sikhs as Pakistan’s ISI & our own  ' making a rather absurd comparison between Pakistan's intelligence agency, the Canadian premier and the Aam Aadmi Party, which is in power in Delhi and the main Opposition party in Punjab. Gupta toned down a bit a day later and wrote another  explaining why he compared a mainstream Indian political party and the Canadian PM to Pakistan's ISI. In this piece, Gupta made an assertion that lies at the root of why India's elite appears to get it wrong on Sikhs. ""In so many ways, Sikhs (in Punjab) are as Hindu as Hindus,"" Gupta wrote, indicating that his understanding of the Sikhs is no different from the Hindu right wing, which terms the community as ""Keshdhari Hindus"". Gupta faced flak even before Trudeau's visit, for a story in  on Khalistanis allegedly operating from Canadian soil. The   said that Trudeau's minister Amarjeet Sohi was arrested in India under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) and insinuated that he is a Khalistan supporter. The story was later  by journalist and writer Amandeep Sandhu, who wrote that Sohi was actually a communist and was arrested in Bihar as a suspected Naxal just because he had a book with the poetry of Punjabi poet Paash. But Gupta wasn't the only so-called liberal from the English media whose skewed view of Sikhs became apparent during Trudeau's visit. Senior journalist Barkha Dutt wrote an  in  , in which she urged Trudeau to leave ""the terrorists and designer kurtas behind"" the next time he comes to India. In her article, Dutt quoted only pro-establishment figures - right-wing academic Vivek Dehejia, former Indian diplomat Vishnu Prakash and Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh's advisor Raveen Thukral. She did not quote a single Sikh, either from Punjab or Canada, in her entire piece. Given the fact that Sikhs were in the middle of the entire controversy, it is strange that Dutt didn't think it necessary to include a single Sikh voice. In the absence of any genuine engagement with community, the media has been passing off silly stereotypes as insights on Sikhs and Punjabis. For instance, Gupta writes, ""The dominant motifs of Punjab are the turban, bhangra, balle-balle and the Golden Temple"". Another senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai asked a Amritdhari Sikh MP from Canada about ""butter chicken"" not realising that Amirtdhari (Baptised) Sikhs are often vegetarian, such as the lawmaker being questioned. Then there was Nistula Hebbar from  , who made fun of Trudeau for volunteering at the langar in Darbar Sahib. Many Sikhs found her jibe in bad taste as working at the langar is considered an extremely pious act. Yet another English news anchor cracked jokes that Justin Trudeau is so pro-Sikh that he should be called Jaswinder Trudeau. Not very different from the Hindutva brigade's Mullah Mulayam barb against   leader   for being pro-Muslim. The media's ignorance about Sikhs was on full display over the past two weeks. It would have continued for a few more days had the death of film actor Sridevi not given the media a chance to plunge to newer lows. Coming back to Trudeau, what is it it about the Canadian prime minister that irks our elite? It can't just be his alleged support to radical Sikh elements. If that is the case, then every party in Punjab should be treated with similar hostility as all of them have done business with radicals at some point of time. If Trudeau has allegedly attended functions organised by Khalistanis, even Captain attended a gathering at Dixie Gurudwara with Khalistan Zindabad written in the background. He also referred to Jagtar Singh Hawara, conspirator in the assassination of former CM Beant Singh, as a ""gentleman"". According to  , the BJP, under the initiative of general secretary Ram Madhav, reached out to radical Sikhs in Canada in the run-up to the Assembly elections in Punjab. Then of course, there is the case of Jaspal Atwal, whom the media described as a ""terrorist"" who was about to crash Trudeau's dinner in Delhi. Eventually, it turned out that Atwal had completed his sentence in Canada and was in fact being wooed by the Indian establishment, which also removed his name from its blacklist. Atwal had not only visited India before, he is reported to have even met government officials. The real grudge against Trudeau appears to be what the Hindi channel wrote: his ""Sikh prem"". It hurts our majoritarian consciousness to see that a community which has been patronisingly treated as a the “younger brother of Hinduism” and the “sword arm of India”, is being treated more equally in another country. It irritates us to see a leader belonging to another culture going out of his way - from wearing kurta pajama to doing bhangra - just to woo a community we have taken for granted for so many years. This is why we make fun of the way he dresses, the way he dances and even the way he volunteers at the langar. The hatred for Trudeau was, in many ways, a product of the widespread bias against Sikhs in India's political elite. According to British journalist Sunny Hundal, ""What really worries the Indian government is the prospect of Sikhs in Britain, Canada and the US getting into positions of power and challenging the abuse of Sikh civil rights in India"". ""Among Indian elites there is palpable concern that Western foreign policy towards India will increasingly be shaped by Sikhs willing to challenge its interests. Hence the alarmist talk about Sikh separatism,"" he  in  . In an  to Scroll.in, sociology professor from Guru Nanak Dev University, Paramjit Singh Judge says, ""There is an emerging widespread view in Punjab that the Modi government treated Trudeau this way because he is seen as close to Sikhs."" Jaspreet Bal, who is in the board of directors of the Sikh Feminist Research Institute in Toronto, slams the Indian media for ""painting Sikhs as terrorists"" and indulging in ""lazy journalism"". ""The media coverage this past week, which has rushed to reclaim that radicalism is flourishing in Canada, has not paused to make the distinctions that Sikhs are not terrorists. Asking for basic rights, speaking out about human rights abuses and contemplating a day when your people are not discriminated against does not make you an extremist,"" she  in  . Evocatively describing the viewpoint of Canadian Sikhs, she wrote, ""despite baseless claims to the contrary, Sikhs have not been radicalised by their trauma. Rather, they have been strengthened by it. As a generation raised in the aftermath of the 1984 genocide is now working as educators, activists, artists, homemakers and laborers, we have used our experience to transform the Canadian landscape. We have taken our parents’ fight for justice and used it to become engaged in politics. We have taken the stories whispered from our widowed grandmothers’ lips and turned them into poetry"". It isn't just diaspora Sikhs like Hundal and Bal, but even Indian Sikhs spoke out against the Modi government's treatment of Trudeau as well as the media's biased coverage. Except for the BJP and Captain Amarinder Singh, every political party in Punjab has criticised Modi for his cold shoulder to Trudeau. Here are tweets by Leader of the Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira of AAP and senior Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa, which are not very different from the criticism of diaspora Sikhs. Another Congress leader  , who is also Punjab's Tourism and Culture Minister, praised Trudeau and said that he was much better than Modi when it came to respecting Sikhs. Shiromani Akali Dal leader Manjeet Singh GK went to the extent of  that ""the Modi government, intelligence agencies, Captain Amarinder Singh and the media conspired to sabotage Trudeau's visit"". Reacting specifically to the controversy surrounding Jaspal Atwal, GK let the cat out of the bag by disclosing that Atwal was being courted by the Union government and he had close links with BJP leader Nalin Kohli. A group of eminent Sikh intellectuals gathered in Chandigarh on 24 February issued a  saying that the Trudeau episode had ""exposed the hypocrisy of the Indian government"". They said that the government ""remained stuck on its agenda of a Hindu Rashtra and deliberately ignored the achievements of Canadian Sikhs"". They further warned the government that its approach will further alienate SIkhs. They also attacked the media for focussing on ""superfluous issues of the 1980s"". Film actor and former AAP leader Gul Panag also slammed the media for raising keeping the Khalistan issue alive, even though it has no support in Punjab. Several Sikhs who are active on social media voiced the same opinion. The mainstream media and the Indian elite in general seem to have misjudged Sikhs on several counts. First, they underestimate the close ties between Sikhs in Punjab and the Sikh diaspora. Second, they have wrongly labelled politically conscious diaspora Sikhs demanding justice for the victims of the 1984 pogrom and encounter killings, as “Khalistani”. Third, they ignore the extent to which Sikhs are upset at the rise of Hindu communalism ever since Modi came to power in 2014. As Prof Judge points out, the homogenising mission of Hindutva can alienate Sikhs. Fourth, they fail to understand that Sikhism is not an offshoot of Hinduism. Nor is it an exclusively India-based religion any longer. It is a transnational community that has made its mark in several countries across the world and whose holy places (Punyabhoomi in Hindutva parlance) lie not just in India but also in Pakistan. It is a community that is driven by the principle of Sarbat Da Bhala (blessings for everyone) and must not be viewed from the restrictive prism of Indian national interest or stereotypes like balle balle and Butter Chicken.   In India, majoritarian hatred against Muslims follows a predicable pattern - it involves projecting the community as a civilisational enemy and the ultimate ""other"". The majoritarian bias against Sikhs is different. It essentially has two elements: First, the complete denial of Sikhs' separate identity as a religious community - by labelling it as ""almost Hindu"" or patronisingly hailing it as ""the sword arm of Hinduism"". Second, the demonisation of Sikhs who don't follow this majoritarian script, as ""Khalistanis"". While the hatred against Muslims overwhelmingly comes from the Hindutva forces, the majoritarian bias against Sikhs can be found in the right wing as well as among so-called liberals. After the troubled 1980s and early 1990s this anti-Sikh sentiment has never been this evident as it was in the last ten days surrounding the visit of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The bias was visible right from the level of the   regime and a section of the Punjab government to the ""liberals"" in the English media. While the Modi government gave a ""cold-shoulder"" to Trudeau over his regime's alleged support to Khalistani militants, the media spared no opportunity to slam the Canadian prime minister and raise the Khalistan bogey. The result is a complete rupture in the narrative of the Indian elite on one hand and the Sikh community on the other.",2018-02-28,, Now that Trudeau is back home will Indian media & netas realise how they hurt Sikhs | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/indian-govt-media-are-actively-alienating-sikhs-majoritarian-bias-at-work-101204.html
439,Rajeev Khanna,"[Today, I call Waris Shah,  Speak from inside your grave, and of the book of love  turn the next affectionate page. When one daughter of Punjab had cried,  You wrote a wailing saga,  Today a hundred thousand daughters, cry to you Waris Shah. Rise! O’ narrator of the grieving,  Rise! look at your Punjab Today, fields are lined with corpses, and blood fills the Chenab] RD Kailey, a local singer, mesmerised the audience with this powerful Amrita Pritam poem at Punjab Arts Council's 'Bandanwar' programme Friday in Chandigarh. As Kailey went on, this reporter's mind wandered from Punjab to Gujarat. To 2002.  Pritam wrote to bring out the misery of the masses engulfed in post-partition riots. I could not help comparing and pondering how true those lines held hold for what Punjab and Bengal suffered in 1947; and what the victims of the 2002 Godhra incident and the following anti-Muslim pogrom went through. Many thought what happened in Gujarat was a culmination of the processes of communal strife fostered by right-wing forces; the Hindutva groups that established their laboratory in the state. After all, they did experiment with the Christians in 1998 and 1999 what they managed to finally achieve on Muslims, their target to justify all the ills pervading the Indian polity and economy. But they were wrong. It was not a culmination of the process of hate and violence that had been unleashed. Gujarat was just an important junction: yet another large-scale experiment to see what it could yield in terms of electoral victories; as a formula for expanding political ground in which communal polarisation would play a major role in demolishing political opposition by raising the bogey of fear and hate.  The Gujarat impact has certainly had a multiplier effect. Across India we see an amplification of the Gujarat model. I am compelled to draw parallels between the Parsi couple Roopa and Dara Mody whose son had gone missing during the attack on the Gulbarg Society in 2002 and Fatima Nafees, mother of missing Jawahar Lal University (JNU) student Najeeb Ahmed.  They can well understand each ohter's plight. Their resilience can be equated with that of the aged Zakia Jafri, the widow of former Parliamentarian Ehsan Jafri who was hacked to death in the Gulbarg Society, who continues to fight for justice. Similarly, the victims of successive riots that have been rocking towns and cities of the Hindi heartland in the last few years like Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar and more recently Kasganj are no different from what had happened in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Lunawada, Dahod, Sabarkantha, Mehsana and other places in Gujarat in 2002.  After all, religious and caste polarisation continues to pay political dividends. In Gujarat while the Dalits had been used to attack Muslims in 2002, they were converted into into targets in the era of cow vigilantism as has been reflected in the episode of public flogging in Una. It is a different matter that a large number of cows continue to perish in Gujarat after consuming poisonous fodder and no Sangh Parivar outfit ever protests there. In other parts of India what has been unleashed in the name of cow is nothing but terror as can be gauged from the lynchings of Mohammed Akhlaq, Pehlu Khan and more recently Junaid Khan.  The era of police encounters that had come to define the nationalism of the police officers in Gujarat in the post 2002 years is now being reflected in Uttar Pradesh as well. The country has recently been stunned by the scam involving the Punjab National Bank as well as some other banks. Gujarat had experienced it way back in the form of the episode involving Madhavpura Mercantile Co-operative Bank. Amid all these are the questions surrounding the murder of former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya and more recently the death of Judge Brijgopal Harkishan Loya. Coming back to Gujarat, there were reports through the day of the victims observing 16th anniversary of the pogrom. This time the focus of the social activists has been on the continuing plight of the people who had been displaced in 2002 and continue to live a life of misery.  According to reports there are still 3,380 families or around 17,000 'Internally Displaced Persons' living in 83 rehabilitation colonies. The maximum of 17 such colonies are in Anand district followed by 15 in Ahmedabad, 13 in Sabarkantha, 11 in Panchmahals, eight in Mehsana, six in Vadodara, five in Aravalli and four each in Bharuch and Kheda.  These colonies lack basic amenities and those residing there do not have any ownership rights. The issue of ownership rights is snowballing into a contentious one that has placed several relief organizations in the dock. There are many social activists who feel that it is high time the victims got the ownership rights because the money spent on building these structures came from donors and not from any individual's pocket.  In certain cases the owners of the land on which these colonies have come up are reportedly seeking their land back. For the residents getting loans and availing other facilities is a big challenge because they cannot furnish residence proofs.  “The fact is that the residents of these colonies are hounded by musclemen and the people are simply helpless,” an activist said. Reports say that while 62 of the 83 colonies are totally unregularised, the remaining are only partially regularised.  “One good thing that has happened over the years is that there is a move towards the Dalit Muslim unity and the Patidars too have realised how they were used by the ruling dispensation in 2002. But the time right now is ripe to develop a second rung of activists within the Muslim community that can take up their issues,” social activist Mukhtar Ahmed said. He points out how ownership rights were given to victim couples in Halol-Kalol area of Panchmahals and there has been no problem now. The victims of the pogrom are yet to put their lives back on track and many more like them are landing in miseries across the country after falling prey to the forces working for polarisation on caste and communal lines to keep drawing electoral benefits and trying to wipe out the political opposition along with the opposition from the common man on the streets. Will this ever end? I can once again find an answer from a Punjabi song played in a bus in which I was traveling this weekend. It once again referred to partition and the lyrics went “ ” (We do not accept this deal where river Chenab is compelled to ask Ravi how is Satluj).  People have started asking questions and this is the first step to salvage their pride in being a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic society, a secular India striving for inclusive development and equal opportunities.

440,Anurag Dey,"In the likely scenario of the NPP forming government with the BJP and thers, the Congress will be left only with Mizoram in the North East. The party has lost three state governments in Assam, Manipur and Arunachal in the region since   led BJP came to power at the Centre in 2014. The polls were held on 27 February for the 59 of the 60 Assembly seats. Voting in Williamnagar constituency was countermanded, following the killing of NCP candidate JN Sangma.Amid the saffron surge in North East, Meghalaya threw up a hung Assembly. The Congress, ruling the state since 2003, emerged as the single-largest party with 21 seats but was far from the magic figure of 31 needed to form the government in the 60-member Assembly. The Conrad Sangma-led National People's Party with 19 seats is at the second spot, emerging as a key player. Founded by late Congress stalwart PA Sangma, the NPP is a constituent of the BJP-led NDA at the Centre, but contested the polls separately. The BJP, which scripted a historic win in Tripura, managed to win two seats. Contesting in 47 seats, the party won in South Shillong and Pynthorumkhrah. According to the the latest trend, the BJP's vote share went up to 9.8 per cent. In sharp contrast, the BJP in 2013 had lost its deposits in all the 13 seats it contested managing just 1.27 per cent of total votes. Another NDA constituent, United Democratic Party (UDP), which contested the polls separately, has won six seats and is also expected to play a key role in government formation. The race for government formation has already heated up. Asserting of forming a non-Congress government, the BJP has deputed its North East face and trusted strategist Himanta Biswa Sarma.  Apprehensive of the rerun of what happened in Goa and Manipur assembly polls, the Congress too rushed two of its senior leaders, Ahmed Patel and Kamal Nath, to Shillong for exploring possibilities of retaining power in the state.  Despite emerging as the single-largest party in both Goa and Manipur, the Congress was caught napping as BJP managed to form the government getting on board smaller parties and independents.  However, it appears to be Advantage BJP. Both the NPP and the UDP are part of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a political coalition comprising the BJP and regional political parties. In fact, NPP President Conrad Sangma has already hinted of allying with the BJP. “We are hopeful that we will be able to form the government. People are fed up with the corrupt Congress government and looking for a change,"" PTI quoted Sangma as saying.  “In Meghalaya, a divided result is a possibility, we will see that a non-Congress government is formed there,” BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav told the media.  The UDP has also formed a pre-poll alliance with Hill State People’s Democratic Party (HSPDP), which bagged two seats and the Garo National Council (GNC). Besides the smaller regional parties, Independents will also play a key role in government formation in the state that has not given a clear mandate to any party after the first elections in 1972. Congress has been running the government in the state since 2013 with help of Independents. Battling infighting and anti-incumbency, the Congress tally came down to 21 from the 29 seats it won in 2013. Last December, five of its MLAs, including former deputy chief minister Rowell Lyngdoh, had resigned from the Assembly. On the brighter side for the party, CM Mukul Sangma won from both Ampati and Songsak constituencies. He admitted the results to be not on expected lines but refused to divulge the party’s plan on government formation. “I would like to keep my cards close to the chest,” Sangma was quoted as saying by PTI.  Patel, however insisted of the Congress having majority. “We have a clear majority in Meghalaya. We have a setback in Tripura in Nagaland, we will have to work on that,” he said.",2018-03-03,, Meghalaya polls: Congress single-largest but Advantage BJP | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/meghalaya-polls-congress-single-largest-but-advantage-bjp-101485.html
441,Catch Team,"The   that created history in Tripura has also notched up its best performance in Nagaland by winning 12 seats. With the state witnessing a hung Assembly, the BJP has emerged as the kingmaker being wooed by both the main regional parties.  They are sure to be in the next government with either the Shurhozelie Liezietsu and TR Zeilang-led Naga People’s Front or the Neiphiu Rio-led Nationalist Democratic People’s Party (NDPP) with which it had a pre-poll alliance. The previous best for the BJP was seven seats under the leadership of senior leader Hokishe Sema in 2003 when Atal Behari Vajpayee was Prime Minister. In 2013, the saffron party was reduced to just one seat. “In Nagaland, NDPP-BJP alliance has secured 30 seats. With the support of 1 independent we are comfortably placed to form d government,” tweeted Ram Madhav. The figures at 6.30 pm indicated that the NPF had won 27 seats and its allies – Conrad Sangma’s National People’s Party and   (United) had won one each. The BJP’s 12 with NDPP’s 17 also makes up 29, indicating a tie in the state. An independent who won, Tongpang Ozukum from the Angetyongpang constituency, is believed to be with NPF, but could switch sides, say sources. Later in the evening the JD(U) announced its support for the BJP for “the formation of a stable government in Nagaland”, indicating that it could shift to the NDPP in case the BJP chooses to stick with Rio. However, BJP’s party in-charge for Nagaland, Kiren Rijiju, was cautious. “It is a hung Assembly, so we will have to discuss,” party in-charge for Nagaland Rijiju told Catch. “ The NPF seemed confident of getting the BJP on its side. “The BJP may go with us for sake of stability. There will be a meeting of the party president and CM candidate Mr TR Zeliang with Mr Rijiju tomorrow,” said a senior NPF source. The trouble is that if the BJP enters the NPF coalition, smaller partners could raise objections during portfolio sharing. Only 12 portfolios can be distributed and due to a recent Supreme Court ruling, the liberal and indiscriminate appointment of parliamentary secretaries by any chief minister may not be possible. Indications are that the saffron party, which contested on 20 seats in a pre-poll alliance with NDPP, could finally bring three-time chief minister Rio back into state politics. Rio’s hopes of being chief minister seemed dashed till afternoon but results in small constituencies changed rapidly. An elated Rio told a news channel that “Prime Minister Modi is a star.” Ultimately, the rivalry between Rio and Zeliang may end in the victory for the more experienced Rio. Zeliang is also said to have been in touch with BJP leaders even ahead of elections in which his NPF and BJP fought tooth and nail. The clashes reportedly resulted in the death of a person in the Akuloto constituency in Zunheboto district on polling day. On the eve of counting day, the NPF that went ballistic against the BJP and tried to brand it an “alien” and “Hindutva party”, changed tack and tried to build bridges. The BJP had never burnt the bridges with the NPF, despite apparent bitterness. Rijiju had made it clear in Guwahati ahead of the elections that NPF is “not an enemy”. In a release Friday, NPF announced that in the interest of the political solution to the Naga problem it continues to be an alliance partner of the BJP. One of the first priorities of a BJP-supported government here will be to bring in a settlement to the talks with the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) and other groups. The proscribed NSCN (Khaplang) also did not engage in mischief during the polls and is believed to be in backdoor talks to come to the negotiating table. In the final year before the General Elections, Prime Minister   may spring a surprise by wrapping up the Naga problem. NSCN (IM) sources said they are extremely hopeful. “We even welcome the NSCN (K) to join the talks, there can be only a single solution,” said the source. Incidentally, the NSCN (IM) has consistently favoured Rio as the chief minister and the true facilitator of the talks. As for the BJP, the Naga solution could be showcased to the electorate as efforts by the NDA government to bring peace in the region.",2018-03-03,," Nagaland polls: BJP wins 12 seats, emerges as kingmaker in hung house  | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/nagaland-polls-bjp-wins-12-seats-emerges-as-kingmaker-in-hung-house-101489.html
442,Aditya Menon,"The BJP has taken over the entire Congress vote in Tripura. The Congress' vote share in the state has consistently been above 40% as it was the main Opposition party in the state. It has fallen to less than 2%. The entire vote has gone to the BJP. However, it does seem that a substantial chunk of Congress' Muslim voters moved to the Left Front and not the BJP. The Left Front managed a significant vote share of 45%, a fall of 7% from 2013. It is clear, therefore, that the BJP largely gained at the Congress' expense, with only a small chunk of disgruntled Left voters flocking to it. The Congress appears to have paid the price for its alliance with the Left in 2016 in West Bengal. This decision triggered an exodus of party workers and leaders, who no longer trusted the party to take on the Left in Tripura. The BJP's dominance was most apparent in urban areas. It has won all the seats in Agartala. It's state unit chief Biplab Kumar Deb won from Banamalipur in the heart of the city and he's likely to be the new chief minister of the state. It also emerged victorious in other seats in the state capital such as Bordowali, Agartala, Ramnagar, Badharghat, Barjala, Suryamaninagar and Pratapgarh It also won in other urban centres like Dharmanagar, Mohanpur and Bishalgarh. Curiously, it lost in Kailashahar to CPI(M)'s Mobashir Ali mainly because Congress candidate Birajit Sinha managed to get 7700 votes. Unemployment among the youth was a major issue in urban areas and BJP appears to have done phenomenally well among young voters. BJP's alliance with the IPFT appears to have worked wonders in the areas dominated by Tripura's indigenous people. The alliance won alliance has won 16 out of 20 seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes. CPI(M) won three. In one seat, counting is yet to take place. This is CPI(M)'s worst ever performance in Tribal areas. Even when it lost in 1972 and 1988, it had won 10 ST seats. The BJP-IPFT alliance managed to capture the resentment of the indigenous people, particularly the youth, against the Left. There was also a complete shift of tribal votes from the INPT to the IPFT. Last time, the INPT got 7.5% votes in the state overall and 41% in the seats it contested. This time it was reduced to just 0.7% vote share in the state. Where the Left managed to do comparatively better are rural seats dominated by Bengali speaking farmers. The Left managed to win close to half these seats, indicating that it's base in these areas is intact. It also managed to win the three seats where Muslims form a significant part of the electorate: Boxanagar, Kadamtala Kurti and Kaliashahar. The BJP's win in Tripura might seem inconsequential from the perspective of the 2019 elections as the state just has two Lok Sabha seats, it is perhaps the BJP's most significant win under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president  . Till now under Modi, the BJP has done well in two kinds of states: First, where it's main rival is the Congress - Haryana, Jharkhand, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Gujarat and Manipur. Even in Jammu and Kashmir, BJP did well only in the Hindu-dominated Jammu region where it was up against the Congress. Second, states like Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, where Congress was one of its rivals but the BJP benefitted from the fact that it always had a base in the state. In contrast to these were states like Delhi, West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where the party lost to powerful regional parties/alliances. Tripura is the first state in which the BJP has managed to defeat a powerful, cadre-based regional formation like the Left Front, that too in a state where it had little presence until three years ago. This is an important lesson for several regional leaders like Naveen Patnaik, K Chandrasekhar Rao, Mamata Banerjee and Pinarayi Vijayan. Interestingly, this is also one of the few states where the party won without making any appeals to Hindutva.  Amit Shah made his intentions clear during his post-victory press conference on Saturday when he said, ""Our golden era will begin when we win Odisha, West Bengal and Kerala as well"".",2018-03-03,, Tripura elections 2018: Three factors that led to BJP's victory in Tripura | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/tripura-elections-2018-three-factors-that-led-to-bjp-s-victory-in-tripura-101488.html

444,Ramakrishna Upadhya,"The   might appear electorally invincible now that it has even defeated the Left Front in its bastion Tripura but poll-bound Karnataka is proving to be a different ball game. The reason: Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. The Congress leader is proving to be a tough nut to crack and the BJP top brass is finding it difficult to understand his native politics. Instead of offering a new vision of what the BJP government would do if voted to power, Modi has been hectoring about ‘dynastic politics’ of the Congress party and asking people to throw out a “corrupt” Siddaramaiah government. He even called it a “10% commission government,” and later, nicknamed Siddaramaiah as “Seedha rupaiyya.” Taking a cue from Modi, the state BJP leaders have accused Siddaramiah government of having sold itself to 30% commission and Yeddyurappa threatening to send Siddaramaiah to jail “within 24 hours of coming to power”. However, an unfazed Siddaramaiah has hit back directly at Modi, saying “the NDA government is running on 90% commission,” alluding to multi-crore bank scams. Siddaramaiah also never tires of calling Yeddyurappa as the first former chief minister of Karnataka to go to jail on corruption charges. Though Yeddyurappa has been leading the BJP’s bandwagon and recently completed a marathon 106-day campaign across all 224 constituencies, drawing huge crowds, there have been persistent rumours that he may lose out on becoming the chief minister – should the BJP win – as he has crossed 75 years. On February 27, when Yeddyurappa celebrated his 76th birthday, Prime Minister Modi made it a point to attend a rally at Davanagere to scotch all such speculations, and presented a model of a plough to Yeddyurappa to reinforce his image as a farmers’ leader. The cutouts and banners greeting Yeddyurappa on his birthday carefully avoided mentioning his age and even party leaders, except Ananth Kumar, merely wished him with no reference to his age. Bu the BJP’s real problem in this election is that Siddaramaiah, though belonging to a national party, is raking up a spate of regional and emotive issues, which have virtually stumped the BJP. Unlike in the past when Congress chief ministers avoided pandering to regional sentiments, Siddaramaiah has the full backing of the new Congress chief,  , who is keener on results than rhetoric. Thus, Siddaramaiah has endeared himself to the Kannadigas by successfully fighting against ‘imposition’ of Hindi in the metro rail, making the teaching of Kannada a compulsory subject in all schools and liberally donating funds to literary events. He has also mooted a separate state flag, which, if adopted, would make Karnataka only the second state after Jammu & Kashmir to have one. He has argued that he is not diminishing the importance of the national flag and since there is no Constitutional ban on a state flag, there was nothing wrong with his proposal. Siddaramaiah has received tremendous support from various Kannada organisations for his move, while the BJP has fallen silent, not able to either support or oppose it. The chief minister is already armed with the recommendation of an expert committee on the design of the flag, and it is only a matter of time before the cabinet takes a view on it. Another issue on which Siddaramaiah put the BJP on the back foot was according the tag of a separate religion to the ‘Lingayats,’ a large section of whom wanted to split from the Veerashiva community. Some of the chief minister’s cabinet colleagues were in the forefront of organising huge rallies of Lingayats in support of the demand and an expert committee was constituted to study the issue and make a recommendation. As Veerashivas, who also go by the name of Lingayats, are largely supporters of the BJP, and Yeddyurappa in particular, Siddaramaiah calculated that a split would immensely benefit the Congress. Even if the NDA government at the Centre did not accept his recommendation for a separate religion status to Lingayats, he would have won a tactical point over the BJP. As arguments for and against the proposal raged, Siddaramaiah has put it on the backburner for the time being. Siddaramaiah’s regional agenda is also aimed at  (S) which has the potential to upset his applecart. There is no love lost between JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda and Siddaramaiah and Gowda recently described the latter as “the worst chief minister he had seen” and regretted that he had played a role in Siddaramaiah’s political growth. Siddaramaiah had resigned from JD(S) in 2006 – upset over Gowda promoting his son HD Kumaraswamy over other senior leaders in the party – and had joined the Congress, which changed his political fortunes. In the upcoming Assembly elections in May, should the Congress fall short of majority, Siddaramaiah is quite sure that JD(S) will not back him for a second term and therefore, he is going all out to keep JD(S)’ gains to the minimum. In the numbers game, if the BJP gets ahead of the Congress but falls short of majority, BJP tying up with the JD(S) to form a government cannot be ruled out. This could happen despite BJP’s bitter experience in a “20-20 game” last time when JD(S) called off the match after completing its innings!",2018-03-05,, Karnataka polls: Have Modi & Shah met their match in CM Siddaramaiah? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/karnataka-polls-have-modi-shah-met-their-match-in-cm-siddaramaiah-101707.html
445,Anil Chamadia,"It’s a strange but interesting contradiction. The   (BJP), like in Tripura, claims to have its influence in most seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes (STs) across the country. But it hardly entrusts leadership and power to the leaders of these communities in those states. In politically and economically tribal-dominated states the political character of mainstream parliamentary parties, including the Congress, the BJP and the Left, remains tinged with similar upper-caste mentality? This question has become more relevant after the results of the recently concluded Tripura Assembly elections. In Tripura, the largest number of seats (20) is reserved for STs; at 31.8 per cent, their share in the population is higher than other castes and communities. But is it politically possible to have a tribal chief minister there?  If we study the leadership sitting at the helms in the states having similar political weightage like Tripura, an answer of this question can be found perhaps. Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh are considered to be tribal-dominated states like Tripura. It is pertinent here, in the context of these states, to clarify the definition of a tribal-dominated state. These states are different from those six states and Union Territories (Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Lakshadweep) where more than half the population is tribal. Also, Manipur and Sikkim have tribal populations at 35.1 per cent and 33. 8 percent, respectively. Political parties, while deciding leadership issue in a state having more than 50 per cent tribal population, never face any dilemma. For them, political challenges arise in those states where a third of the population is tribal. Can any mainstream political party muster courage to entrust the leadership to a person from a tribal community after winning an Assembly election. In Tripura, the BJP is giving credit to its alliance with Indigeneous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) for wining all 20 seats reserved for tribals. But can the saffron party accept a tribal leadership there in the post-result scenario? In states like Tripura, the tribal population is only acceptable as an electoral vehicle for ensuring victory or defeat as per the wishes of upper castes leaderships of the mainstream parliamentary parties?  If we trace the answer of Tripura in Jharkhand, the BJP got an absolute majority there for the first time in the last Assembly elections. That too on its own. But it decided to instal a non-tribal leader chief minister. Raghubar Das became the first non-tribal chief minister of Jharkhand.  When Jharkhand was being carved out as a separate state from Bihar, an alibi was frequently given those days that it’s an essential step in the interest of tribal population of that region. It was the people of tribal communities who had built a strong movement for a separate state right after the Independence. The rhetoric of a tribal chief minister remained valid only till no mainstream political party secured majority in the Assembly since the birth of the new state. In Chhattisgarh also, the BJP is in power on its own and its leadership there is in the hands of an upper caste leader for the last 15 years. That state was carved out from Madhya Pradesh to end the backwardness of the region's tribal population. The Congress made Ajit Jogi, a bureaucrat of tribal background, its first CM. But this was done before the first official Assembly election in the state was held. While Chhattisgarh has 30.6 per cent tribal population, there is 26.2 per cent tribal population in Jharkhand. There are a total 29 and 28 reserved seats respectively for the tribals in these two states.  Politically, they enjoy even more powerful electoral weightage only because they are spread all along in the both states and the victory of non-tribal leaders squarely depends on their votes. In Odisha as well, there are only 33 reserved seats for the tribals. But with a 22.8 per cent population they are capable of casting influence on a majority of its Assembly seats. Here also, there has been no tribal CM all since Independence except Giridhar Gamang (1999, Congress). That too was a stop-gap arrangement at a time of factionalism within the party. Mainstream political parties don’t entrust leadership to a tribal in these states; they only use tribal communities as a tool to ensure power to an upper-caste leadership? Mainstream political parties in these states equate tribals with Maoist and separatist politics.  As senior journalist Sudhir Patnaik points out, tribals and Dalits are used by mainstream parties only to play their cards.",2018-03-06,, Why mainstream parties disqualify a tribal for leadership in tribal-dominated states | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-mainstream-parties-disqualify-a-tribal-for-leadership-in-tribal-dominated-states-101856.html
446,Rajeev Khanna,"  It has been one year that the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has been out of power in Punjab and it is only a year left for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls. Sensing that there is little time left, the party under Sukhbir Badal has started getting its act together. Sources say that the party will soon be shifting gears after the Congress government led by Captain Amarinder Singh presents its Budget. The SAD had won four seats in the last Lok Sabha polls while its ally, the   (BJP) had won two. While four seats were won by the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) had won four and the Congress could manage to win only three of the total of 13 seats and this included Amarinder's victory over BJP leader   in Amritsar. The Akalis have started setting the tone for the parliamentary battle next year. The party along with the BJP used the occasion of the Hola Mohalla congregation at Anandpur Sahib on the occasion of Holi to make its tone and tenor clear for the days to come. The Congress and AAP had refrained from holding a political conference on the occasion continuing with the practice of not holding political rallies on religious occasions. Sukhbir along with the state BJP chief Vijay Sampla, Akali MP Prem Singh Chandumajra and former ministers in the Akali government Madan Mohan Mittal and Daljit Singh Cheema lambasted the Congress regime accusing it of failing on every front. The Akalis used the occasion to strike an emotional cord with the people while mixing religion and politics which is their trademark. Sukhbir expressed pride over former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal spending Rs 2,000 crore on building memorials and preserving Punjab’s heritage. He attacked his cousin and finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal along with culture minister   calling such initiatives a 'white elephant' and waste of resources. He attacked Amarinder for not visiting the Golden Temple for four months after assuming office. Claiming that the Congress is all set to deny the farmers free power that was given during the decade long Akali rule, Sukhbir announced that his party has decided to 'shake the government out of slumber' and would gherao the state assembly on the very first day of the Budget session. Sampla claimed that all development works have come to a standstill under the Congress rule and people are being deprived of benefits. The Akalis have been cornering the state government over 'Goonda Tax' being collected at various places and continuing illegal mining in the state. Recently, they took on the Dalit ministers in the government asking them why they have not been raising the issue of violation of implementation of Right to Education (RTE) Act which assures free and compulsory education in private unaided schools to Dalits and those Below Poverty Line (BPL) families. Former minister Gulzar Singh Ranike has pointed that the reprimand by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes in this context is a proof of the anti-Dalit attitude of the Congress government. “It is condemnable that Dalit ministers like Charanjit Singh Channi and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot never spoke out about the need to implement the RTE Act ,” he said. Top Akali leaders have been sending across strong messages to the voters on various emotive and populist issues. Sukhbir has decided not to reply to the chairman of the commission probing the incidents of sacrilege during the SAD-BJP regime. He has accused Justice Ranjit Singh (Retired) of being a Congressman and a friend of Amarinder. He has asked the chairman to 'recuse himself from chairing the commission'. Meanwhile Sukhbir's wife and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal recently tried to score some brownie points during Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's visit urging the latter to facilitate starting Toronto - Amritsar Air Canada flights and asking the Canadian government to jointly celebrate the 550th Parkash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev in league with the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC). The Congress will have to ensure that it starts delivering on the promises made to the people during the Assembly polls. It has a cushion still working in its favour in the form of people still being angry over the performance of the SAD-BJP regime but it remains to be seen till when this anger survives before it subsides. In a meeting with his party MPs and MLAs ministers on Thursday Amarinder announced his government’s decision to set aside Rs 128 crore every month for disbursement of old age pension and assured that the distribution of free mobile phones to youth would commence this year. Reiterating his government’s commitment to implementation of every single manifesto promise of the Congress, he claimed that as many as 150 promises have been fulfilled in the first year itself and the remaining are also in the process of execution. Amarinder reiterated that loans for 10.25 lakh of the total 17.5 lakh farmers in the state would be settled by November this year, with 1 lakh farmers set to be provided debt relief certificates at a state level function this month itself. He further disclosed that the March 11 job mela will see employment being provided to 40,000 youth. He shared details of his government’s plans to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev and disclosed that he has written to Prime Minister   for grants for the programme. He has also requested former Prime Minister Dr   to chair the organising committee for the event.  ",2018-03-06,," With a year to go for LS polls, Akalis start getting their act together in Punjab | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/with-a-year-to-go-for-ls-polls-akalis-start-getting-their-act-together-in-punjab-101867.html
447,Aditya Menon,"Speaking to the media on Sunday, BSP supremo   didn't directly admit to the alliance but said that her party supporters will vote for the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. In return, the SP is likely to back a BSP candidate to the Rajya Sabha. The two parties will also help each other in the Vidhan Parishad elections in the state. The understanding is said to be the direct initiative of SP chief and former UP chief minister  . He has in the past expressed his willingness to have an alliance with the BSP. Interestingly Yadav's erstwhile ally, the Congress is not part of this alliance and it has already put up candidates in the two Lok Sabha seats. However, Yadav has cleverly roped in the small but influential NISHAD party, which has a significant presence in Gorakhpur, the bastion of UP CM  . Praveen Kumar Nishad son of NISHAD party chief Sanjay Nishad will be contesting on an SP ticket from the seat. This appears to be an astute move as the Nishad/Mallah or boatmen community have been a significant support base for Adityanath, both politically as well as at the Gorakhnath Mutt. Akhilesh has also brought in the Peace Party led by Dr Mohammad Ayub, which has some support among Ansari Muslims in Eastern UP. Akhilesh's aim appears to be to create a broad Bahujan alliance by bringing together the SP's Muslim-Yadav base and BSP's Dalit-Muslim base and wooing other backward communities, who had shifted to the BJP in the last elections. Keeping this in mind, the SP has fielded a Mallah, Praveen Nishad, in Gorakhpur and a Kurmi, Nagendra Pratap Singh Patel, in Phulpur. This isn't Yadav's first attempt at wooing Nishads. On the eve of the Uttar Pradesh elections, his government had included the community in the Scheduled Caste list. The matter is still sub-judice. Interestingly, the Congress is not part of this arrangement and the party has put up candidates for the bypolls. Perhaps the calculation is that the Congress could potentially take away a part of the BJP's Upper Caste votes especially as the party has fielded Brahmins in both seats. On Monday, the   also announced its support for the SP in the bypolls. If the voting pattern in the bypolls is a repeat of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP would be unbeatable as the party got over 50% votes in both Phulpur and Gorakhpur. BJP: 52.4% SP: 20.3% BSP: 17.1% Congress: 6.1% BJP: 51.8% SP: 21.8% BSP: 17% Congress: 4.4% But the SP-BSP-NISHAD-Peace Party-RLD alliance could win both the seats if the BJP's popularity is where it was during last year's Vidhan Sabha elections and if the allies transfer their votes effectively. Phulpur has five Assembly segments: Phaphamau, Soraon, Phulpur, Allahabad West and Allahabad North. BJP won all these seats in the Assembly elections, except the Soraon reserved seat which was won by its ally Apna Dal. If we add the votes garnered by all the parties in these five seats, we get: BJP + Apna Dal: 436196 (43%) SP: 239080 (23.6%) BSP: 226370 (22.3%) Congress: 54166 (5.3%) NISHAD party: 2974 (0.3%) RLD: 3220 (0.3%) Total: 1013812 It must be remembered that the SP and Congress contested the Assembly polls in alliance. Among these 5 seats, SP contested four and the Congress contested one, Allahabad North. If one adds the votes of the SP, BSP, NISHAD Party and RLD, the total is marginally above the BJP by a few percentage points. This does not include the Congress' votes. BJP + Apna Dal: 43% SP+BSP+NISHAD+RLD: 46.5% Congress: 5.3% The case of Gorakhpur is similar. The five segments in the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seats are Caimpiyarganj, Pipraich, Gorakhpur Urban, Gorakhpur Rural and Sahajanwa. BJP won all the five seats in the Vidhan Sabha elections. If we add the votes cast in these five seats, we get: BJP : 452495 (40.1%) SP: 187143 (16.6%) BSP: 217710 (19.3%) Congress: 120273 (10.7%) NISHAD: 61616 (5.5%) Peace Party: 2252 (0.2%) RLD: 9321 (0.8%) Total: 1126902 Here again the combined vote share of the SP-BSP-NISHAD-Peace Party-RLD alliance is marginally more than the BJP. BJP: 40.1% SP+BSP+NISHAD+Peace Party+RLD: 42.4% Congress: 10.7% One must note that the SP had contested three seats and the Congress contested two among these constituencies. Of course, such a simple calculation may not be able to predict how people in Phulpur and Gorakhpur vote on March 11. There are a number of X-factors that one must keep in mind: Whoever wins in the bypolls will have a term of just a little over a year, with Lok Sabha elections due in 2019. But the results would be significant. If BJP wins despite the SP-BSP alliance, it would mean that the party's popularity in UP is intact and it will in all likelihood sweep UP in the 2019 general elections.  But if the SP-led alliance manages to pull of an upset it will be significant in a number of ways.  Arch-rivals   (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party ( ) have arrived at an understanding for the upcoming bypolls to the Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh.

The razing of the statue and the defence of the act by BJP leaders has come as a clear evidence of the kind of politics the party believes in. Tripura was a shock win for the BJP, with the party having had zero presence in the state assembly so far. Given that background, exultation is understandable. However, the form of celebration is what distinguishes BJP from others. One need not be an admirer of Lenin to realise that the destruction of his statue is an indicator of the hatred the Sangh Parivar harbours towards rival ideologies. The act harks back to similar moments in Indian as well as world history, all of them potent symbols of intolerance and barbarism – the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in 2001, the toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue by Iraqi civilians and US troops in 2003 and the destruction of the Babri Masjid by Hindu radicals in 1992. With this act in Tripura, the BJP has revived the accusations of intolerance that led to the protest movements against the   government in 2015. This has also signaled an ominous start of BJP's rule in the state, coming as it does just a day before the party's selection of its CM-designate. The CPM, thrown out of power, has already alleged that its workers and offices are being attacked across the state. Just three days after the election results, Section 144 has already been imposed in parts of the state following reports of violence. From here on, among BJP's foremost challenges will be to ensure rule of law in the state. For that, BJP will have to start respecting other ideologies, something that its slogans like “Congress-mukt Bharat” and “Vaampanth-mukt Bharat” have no room for. If the Britishers can tolerate Mahatma Gandhi's statue just outside their Parliament and India can tolerate V D Savarkar's statue inside its Parliament, why can't BJP tolerate statues of Lenin, Nehru, Ambedkar, Periyar and all others in whose name several BJP leaders keep issuing threats?It suddenly seems like a miracle that a statue of Soviet leader Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, aka Lenin, survives in the heart of the national Capital. The life-size alloy statue in Nehru Park was unveiled in November 1987 by the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and then Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov. The BJP first came to power in Delhi six years later, but no BJP worker touched any statue in the city, let alone Lenin's. Alas, Belonia town in Tripura wasn't extended the same courtesy by BJP workers. Within two days of a BJP-led alliance storming to power in the north-eastern state so far known as the last bastion of the Left in India, ecstatic BJP workers bulldozed a statue of Lenin in the town.",2018-03-06,, Lenin was no Buddha but razing his statue sure equals Bamyan horrors | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/pov/lenin-was-no-buddha-but-upstalling-his-statue-sure-equals-bamyan-horrors-101865.html
449,Anurag Dey,"As the BJP steadily gears up for the next general elections, its ideological mentor the   (RSS) is likely to witness an organisational rejig. Speculations are rife that Dattatreya Hosabale will be taking over as the new Sarkaryavah (General Secretary) replacing Suresh “Bhaiyyaji” Joshi, whose term ends in March. Hosabale, considered close to Prime Minister  , is currently one of the four joint general secretaries. According to sources, Joshi is likely to demit office on health grounds during the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS) meeting scheduled in March at RSS headquarters in Nagpur. The ABPS is highest decision-making body of the RSS. Next in command only to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, the general secretary functions as the chief executive. Besides appointing central office bearers, the general secretary presides over the ABPS and leads the Kendriya Karyakari Mandal or the executive committee. The likely elevation of “pro Modi” Hosabale, comes at a time when the RSS and its affiliates have been increasingly getting critical of the Modi government particularly over its economic and labour policies. The RSS has repeatedly expressed its displeasure over growing unemployment and agrarian distress. Hailing from Karnataka, Hosabale is a popular figure within the Sangh parivar and is known for his organisational skill. Coinciding with Modi’s tenure as the Prime Minister, Hosabale’s stature within the Sangh has risen in the last four years. Having cut his political teeth as a student leader, Hosable also enjoys cordial ties with prominent BJP ministers and leaders, many of whom are products of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of the RSS. However, opinions are seemed to be divided over Hosabale’s elevation. With the next general election already on the horizon, many within the RSS want Joshi to continue. He played a major role in the RSS throwing its entire weight behind the BJP in the 2014 polls. Close to Bhagwat, Joshi has been instrumental in ensuring the RSS’ greater say within the policy making of the government. Many feel, Hosabale’s elevation could dilute the equation and the Sangh may end up playing second fiddle to the BJP. Incidentally, Hosabale was also said to be in the reckoning for the post during the last ABPS meeting in 2015. However, Joshi was appointed as the general secretary for his third straight term. Besides the next general elections, high stake states for the BJP like Rajasthan, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are also slated to go for the polls, and many within the Sangh don’t want am immediate change of guard at the top. Some feel RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat may give Joshi another term to maintain status quo. “Unanimity is the essence of any of Sangh’s decision particularly when it comes making appointments. In case there is no such unanimity, Joshi may be given another term,” said an RSS functionary.",2018-03-06,, Will 'Modi man' Dattatreya Hosabale be the next RSS general secretary? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/will-modi-man-dattatreya-hosabale-be-the-next-rss-general-secretary-101869.html
451,Atul Chandra,"In a major political development, the Bahujan Samaj Party has decided to support   candidates in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections in Uttar Pradesh in an effort to form an anti-  alliance. The two by-elections are due to be held on  . In Gorakhpur, the seat held by   for five consecutive terms, the SP has fielded Pravin Kumar Nishad against BJP’s Upendra Shukla and Congress’s Surhita Chatterjee Karim. In Phulpur, the SP and BJP have both fielded OBC candidates. Nagendra Singh Patel of SP will take on BJP’s Kaushalendra Singh Patel. Congress has opted for a Brahmin, Manish Mishra. “We have not fielded any candidate for the Phulpur and Gorakhpur by-elections. My party members will vote to defeat the BJP,”   said in a statement. , the SP president, who had decided to contest the UP assembly elections in 2017 with the Congress, withdrew from the alliance after his party’s dismal performance. The Samajwadi Party will return the favour by helping   chief Mayawati in the Rajya Sabha polls. “SP will support our Rajya Sabha candidate in return,” Mayawati said. Elections to ten Rajya Sabha seats are scheduled to be held later this month. Mayawati also said that her party will support SP candidates in the legislative council elections. While Akhilesh chose to remain quiet on the thaw in relations with the BSP, it was his party’s spokesperson Pankhuri Pathak who confirmed the deal on Twitter. The ties between the two parties broke down after Mayawati was nearly molested at the State Guest House in Lucknow in 1995 when BSP withdrew support to   government. After the attack on her by the SP goondas, Mayawati cosied up with the BJP and until the announcement on  , 2018 she determinedly opposed any alliance with, or support to, the SP. About the possibility of an alliance between the two sworn enemies for the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, Mayawati said that a call would be taken later and would depend on seat-sharing. Mayawati extended her conditional support offer also to Congress. She said her party will support Congress in Madhya Pradesh if the latter backs her Rajya Sabha candidate in UP. The SP has 47 candidates, BSP 19 and Congress six in the state assembly. After ensuring victory of its candidate the SP will be left with a surplus of only nine votes. Mayawati is eyeing these votes in addition to the seven votes of Congress to ensure that she makes it to the Upper House but with the votes in her favour adding up to only 34 her re-entry into the Rajya Sabha will not be without hiccups. The short-term, opportunistic alliance between Bua (as Mayawati was called by Akhilesh) and Babua (name given to SP chief by Mayawati), if sustained, could turn formidable for the BJP because of the size of SP-BSP’s mutually transferable vote bank. However, the percentage of votes polled by the SP (21.75) and BSP (16.95) in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections fall way too short of BJP’s 51.80. The SP, BSP and Congress fared much better in the 2017 Assembly elections. If the two parties can thrash out an alliance, even if its longevity will always be in doubt, it is likely to be more effective than any alliance involving the Congress. Muslims who still are reluctant to support Congress would be more comfortable with the OBC-Dalit combination. The only problem is the unpredictable nature of Mayawati. If she is ready to give up the state for a role in national politics the ties may hold. That would leave the Congress, which has put up candidates for both Gorakhpur and Phulpur, high and dry. Having burnt his fingers by forging a friendship with Rahul in the Assembly elections, Akhilesh Yadav would now be twice shy. Both SP and BSP will avoid a three-way split of seats for Lok Sabha given the Congress’s representation in the state Assembly and Lok Sabha. The Congress thus faces the bleak prospect of contesting the Lok Sabha election alone, unless   performs a magician’s hat-trick. The Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypoll results would show whether it is headed for decimation in Uttar Pradesh.   March 11 March 4",2018-03-05,, SP-BSP tie-up can scare BJP and decimate Congress in UP | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/sp-bsp-tie-up-can-scare-bjp-and-decimate-congress-in-up-101706.html
452,Sulagna Sengupta,"A clash took place between All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) supporters and BJP supporters on Thursday after BJP supporters went to Keoratala Park at Rashbehari for “purification” of a statue of Shyama Prasad Mookerjee. The statue had been allegedly vandalised on Wednesday by a group of students from Jadavpur University belonging to CPI(Maoist). According to the police, around 15 BJP supporters were injured in the clash. Soon after the BJP procession entered Rashbehari, they were stopped by the police and a barricade was placed. The BJP supporters tried to break the barricade and tried to enter the arena where Shyama Prasad Mookerjee was placed . The AITC supporters are alleged to have attacked the BJP supporters and prevented them from enterinz the area . Baisakhi Das, a BJP worker, said “ It was our pre-decided program and we have come here to show our respect to Mookerjee by organising a purification program. Not only did they prevent us from touching the statue, they even beat up some of our members who were silently standing in a queue . In retaliation , BJP has decided to organise a state-wide agitation on Friday and it will place Mookerjee's photo on street corners and put garlands on it. According to West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, “I was leading the BJP rally. Suddenly I saw that the police put up a barricade on the main Rashbehari Road and did not allow us to enter the area. I requested the police officer but he did not relent. Suddenly around 15 Trinamool workers attacked our supporters and beat them up mercilessly. Some of them received injuries in their hand and head .As a result of such an incident we have decided to organise a state-wide agitation on Friday their violence”. Uttam Dutta, an AITC worker from Kalighat said, “We had received orders not to let anyone touch Mookerjee's statue as it's the duty of the Kolkata Muncipal Corporation to restore the vandalised statue. In the name of purification , the BJP supporters tried to create communal tensions. We won’t allow anybody to create any disturbance in the area.” Hours after the incident, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said at a rally on International Women's Day, “Trinamool Congress will uproot BJP from the country in 2019. Come 2019, BJP will be finished”. “TDP is deserting BJP because of communal politics and in Bengal we won’t let BJP create any communal disturbance. Women need to unite to fight BJP ,” she said. According to Banerjee “Some people (BJP) are blaming the state government after some students belonging to CPI (Maoist) vandalised the statute of Shyama Prasad Mookerjee.

453,Swapna Mohanty,"After two Lenin’s statues were demolished, a statue of EV Ramasamy, commonly known as Periyar (anti-untouchability) activist and Dravidian movement leader, was vandalised by two men in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore district on Tuesday evening.  As per the police, the nose of the Periyar statue inside Tirupathur Corporation Office was damaged by the vandals. Violence isn't limited to Tripura alone, it has spread to other states like Kolkata, Coimbatore and other parts of Tamil Nadu.  On Wednesday another case of vandalism was recorded in Jadavpur University Kolkata. The statue of the founder of right-wing nationalist Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Syama Prasad Mukherjee was vandalized. Bust of the leader's statue was wrecked.  PM, Modi has strongly disapproved such an act and asked the states to prevent hooliganism.

454,Charu Kartikeya,"Naidu's considered avoidance of an aggressive break-up appears understandable. He can hope to influence the Union government only as long as he is within the ruling alliance. Once outside the NDA, he will lose all options to negotiate. What is not entirely clear, however, is the BJP's approach. Finance Minister  's statements, which Naidu indicated precipitated the crisis, were hardly short of a snub. They amounted to not just a firm rejection of the demand for special status, but also a dig at TDP for demanding too much. Naidu has been saying for a long time now that he visited Delhi 29 times in the recent past, but no one in the BJP paid any heed to him. He has also alleged that Prime Minister Modi was “unavailable” when he tried to inform the latter over the phone about TDP's decision to exit the government. Why the BJP's attitude is baffling because the TDP is among its biggest allies in Delhi, with 16 members in the Lok Sabha. Only Shiv Sena has more (18) than that and the it has openly rebelled. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi, once sympathetic to the BJP – though formally not a part of the NDA – has also declared lack of confidence in the party's government and has called for a non-BJP, non-Congress alliance. The Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party is the only party that the BJP can still force to dance to its tunes because of the plethora of cases against its chief Jaganmohan Reddy. However, it has all of nine members in the lower house, far short of TDP's tally. Also, there is no guarantee of the YSRCP's support because special status for Andhra is an emotive issue that it can not avoid. Could it be that recent electoral victories in Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland have made the BJP complacent about returning to power in the Lok Sabha with bigger numbers of its own? If that is indeed the case, then the NDA appears all set to run into rough weather, because Lok Sabha polls are still at some distance.There is little doubt that the Telugu Desam Party's decision to withdraw its ministers from the  -led government at the Centre will have serious implications for the   (BJP).  It must be noted though that TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu is still keeping windows open. He has not exited the National Democratic Alliance; even while announcing the resignations, he maintained a level of cordiality. That is in contrast to the sharp attacks that marked recent outburts by   leaders against the BJP.

455,Akash Bisht,"While announcing the political agreement, Mayawati clarified that the understanding was limited to the current by-polls. Any alliance will be announced publicly, she said.  Experts are still divided over the possibility of a more permanent pre-poll arrangement in the run-up to 2019. “Whether you call it an alliance or an understanding, one thing is for sure: the BSP's agenda is to win a Rajya Sabha seat and get Mayawati back into the Upper House,” said Kanpur-based political analyst AK Verma. SP's   is also looking at bigger things ahead, according to Verma. The former UP CM “has nothing to lose and is trying to bargain in anticipation of support in Parliamentary elections,” he said. But an between the two will hurt both the SP ad the BSP as “people are fully aware that such an arrangement is with the single motive of defeating BJP”, Verma said.  “Modi has been successful in creating this persona at the national level of someone consistently working on the development plank. He is investing his 100% and is forcing his ministers to do the same, which is being appreciated by people. Any alliance of this sort will backfire,” Verma added.  A former BSP leader too ruled out the possibility of such an alliance. “It is a win-win situation for Mayawati, considering the BSP gets a Rajya Sabha seat for just tacitly supporting the SP. She wants to send her brother to the upper house and save him since from several pending criminal cases,” the leader said. According to him, the whole point of the BSP chief's Sunday press conference was to assure potential ticket seekers that there was nothing to worry: “She doesn't want to lose the opportunity of auctioning these tickets.” There would be an economic conflict too for the two parties to come together, according to Verma. “SP is a party of Other Backward Classes, who are landowners and wield considerable influence. BSP supporters, on the other hand, are those who work as labourers in fields owned by such OBCs,” he said. “It is an exploitative relation. It will be impossible for the BSP to come to terms with OBCs,” he added. Sudha Pai, a former professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, however disagrees with Verma on the ground that UP has undergone massive demographic and political change. The exploitative relation that Verma talks about existed in the 1990s, according to her. “My assessment is that such an alliance will heavily depend on the results of these by-polls,” Pai said. Many other political outfits are also taking shape in the run-up to 2019 and one has to wait and watch, she added. Congress leader Rashid Alvi welcomed the decision, saying it would have been even better had the Grand Old Party been taken into confidence. “In UP, all secular forces should come together to defeat the BJP. I welcome this alliance. I am hopeful that all secular forces would come together in 2019,” he added. Many, however, believe that the Congress fighting these seats would benefit the SP by dividing upper-caste votes. “Once the results are out, everyone would know what could happen if the SP and the BSP join hands in UP. This is a historic moment and will set the agenda for the 2019 polls, which will see the BJP warming up the Opposition benches in parliament,” said an SP leader.Can bitter rivals   and the Bahujan Samaj Party come together for taking on the  ? The answer may lie in the byelections to Gorakhpur and Phulpur. The two Lok Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh fell vacant after incumbents   and Keshav Prasad Maurya took over as the state's chief minister and deputy CM respectively. The results to these bypolls will indicate whether the saffron juggernaut, which has steamrolled other parties in UP, can be brought to a halt by joining forces. The SP and the  's coming together is after a gap of 23 years. Until Adityanath took over as CM last year, the two parties took turns to govern it in these years and were bitter rivals. The bitterness can be traced back to 1995 when BSP supremo   was assaulted by Samajwadi goons. Unsurprisingly, the news of the two parties coming together on Sunday was a jolt for the BJP that was busy celebrating its success in the North East. Until then the party was confident that its election machinery and grassroots penetration would see it through in the two constituencies. An adverse result would not only mean a snub to the might of Adityanath, but would also give the BJP jitters about the 2019 General Elections.  With 73 of its 80 seats going to the National Democratic Allaince, UP contributed the most to  's kitty in 2014.

456,Rajeev Khanna,"As the  's 'High Command' focus on crucial upcoming Assembly elections in bigger states, the party's leadership in Himachal Pradesh are busy squabbling over petty issues. The drubbing in the state polls barely three months ago has had no sobering effect on the party's factionalism. Cadres feel it is high time the leaders pull up their socks and start gearing up for the forthcoming parliamentary polls. But former chief minister Virbhadra Singh and HP Congress Committee chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu continue to run each other down and exchange barbs on every possible occasion.  In a bid to get its act together, the party recently organised a state-level conference in Mandi and launched a campaign seeking accountability from sitting Lok Sabha members of the   (BJP). The venue was significant as the party had scored a big zero in the district, which was once its stronghold and sends 10 legislators to the Assembly. But this effort was marred by the absence of Virbhadra and most of his supporters and his son Vikramaditya Singh.  The Congress Legislative Party's (CLP) Mukesh Agnihotri and the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for the state Ranjeet Ranjan though attended. Sukhu claimed Virbhadra was invoted. The Mandi chapter followed an exchange of barbs between Sukhu and Virbhadra barely 10 days ago. The former royal has been consistently demanding that Sukhu be replaced, claiming the party wouldn't win the parliamentary polls under his leadership.  Sukhu, on his part, had called Virbhadra a liar and pointed out that the suffered a terrible defeat in the recent assembly poll under Virbhadra. According to him, 56 of the 68 tickets for the 2017 Assembly polls were given on Virbhadra's recommendations. Only 15 of those candidates sailed through; on the other hand, six of the 12 candidates approved by the party organisation won.  Virbhadra's detractors have been blaming his ego for the departure of senior Congress leaders like Anil Sharma and Vijay Singh Mankotia. They don't fail to point out that the former CM decided all candidates for the 2014 parliamentary polls and the party couldn't win a single seat in the state. “Both these leaders have own goals to achieve. It is a fact that the Virbhadra era is over and he is on the verge of retirement but he wants to capture the ground for his son. His entire effort is that his son either becomes the state unit chief or an AICC general secretary at the earliest. But everyone knows the culture of the Congress where things move by just an inch after long intervals,” said a party insider. He further disclosed that Sukhu, on the other hand, is keen to prolong his stint. “If he manages to remain the PCC chief till the forthcoming parliamentary polls, it would be a big achievement for him,” he added. Some sources said Sukhu's tenure has been marked by the party organisation being strengthened at the grassroots and Virbhadra's sheer desperation has brought the party to this point. According to them, Vikramaditya has had no major achievement and several Congress workers are annoyed at the dynastic trend. As of now, the field lies wide open for a strong leadership to emerge in the state. Mukesh Agnihotri, a four-time election winner, was one evident choice as CLP leader. Party heavyweight Asha Kumari would have been an obvious choice but for the episode of her slapping a policewoman.  As the party brass grapples with preparing for elections in Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and the Lok Sabha, no one seems to be bothered about what is happening in the Himalayan state.

459,Aditya Menon,"Naidu said that even before pulling his ministers out of the government, he tried to reach out to PM Modi but received no response. It appears that the last straw for the TDP were the remarks by Finance Minister   on Wednesday, in which he categorically refused special status for Andhra Pradesh. ""We cannot give special status for Andhra Pradesh. A special package has already been given...Special status was originally meant for North Eastern states whose own resources are inadequate,"" Jaitley said. Jaitley further said that ""funds cannot be allocated on the basis of sentiments"". This comment didn't go down well with the TDP, a party that came up out of the blue in Andhra Pradesh in the 1980s in response to Rajiv Gandhi's alleged insult of the then T Anjaiah. It is clear that Naidu and his party saw Arun Jaitley's comment as an insult. ""The remarks of finance minister Arun Jaitley seemed to suggest that we were asking for too much money,"" Naidu said. ""We are only asking for our rights,"" he added. Soon after Jaitley's comment, Naidu called a meeting of TDP leaders, MPs, MLAs and MLCs in Amravati to gauge their response. The overwhelming demand from them was that the TDP must snap ties with BJP. So barely a few hours after Jaitley ruled out special status for Andhra Pradesh, Naidu pulled out of the NDA government. However, the CM says that this is just the ""first step"". As of now the TDP has just withdrawn ministers from the Union government. It is still part of the NDA and two BJP leaders continue to be part of his council of ministers in Andhra Pradesh. But if the BJP fails to respond, the TDP will completely snap its alliance. Relations between the two parties had become rocky over the past one year or so. The main bone of contention was the special status issue. TDP leaders had continuously been accusing the BJP of betraying its promise. One TDP MP, M Murali Mohan, went to the extent of threatening that ""if the Centre continued to ill treat southern states, they may have to form a separate country"". And with the YSRCP chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy and Congress president   attacking the Modi government on the special status issue, Naidu had no option but to take on the BJP on this issue. TDP leaders were also upset with the manner in which Andhra Pradesh BJP leaders had openly been criticising CM Naidu. The TDP gave an indication of its disapproval by voting against the government's Triple Talaq Bill in the Rajya Sabha. The move was aimed at ""showing the BJP its place"" as well as expressing solidarity with a significant chunk of the Muslim community that was opposed to the Bill in its present form. Another reason for the TDP's withdrawal is said to be the feedback from its rank and file that the party is likely to lose ground because of its association with the BJP. There is dissatisfaction against Modi in the state, especially over the special status issue and the faulty implementation of the Goods and Services Tax. According to the ABP News-CSDS survey conducted in January this year, 52% people in Andhra Pradesh are dissatisfied with Modi's performance as PM as against 37% who said they are satisfied. This is a complete turnaround from the survey in May 2017 in which 48% said they were satisfied with Modi and 38% said they are dissatisfied. With 16 Lok Sabha MPs and 6 Rajya Sabha MPs, TDP is the BJP's biggest ally. If it exits the NDA completely, it would be a huge blow to Modi ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. It must be remembered that the BJP's second largest ally, the   with 18 MPs in the Lok Sabha and 3 in the Rajya Sabha, has also threatened to pull out of the NDA by the end of this year. Naidu's move also adds strength to the narrative that BJP is threatening India's federalism, a charge that has been made by CMs like Mamata Banerjee and   in the past. Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, too, joined this bandwagon recently and he is learnt to be in touch with Naidu.The Telugu Desam Party has pulled out of the   government at the Centre in protest against the BJP's ""betrayal"" on the special status for Andhra Pradesh. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu announced his party's decision at a press conference late on Wednesday night in the new state capital Amravati. ""Both our ministers will be resigning from the Central government tomorrow,"" Naidu said. The TDP had two ministers in the Modi government: Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju and Minister for State for Science and Technology YS Chowdary. In a press conference that lasted a little less than an hour, Naidu virtually accused the Modi government of insulting him and betraying the people of Andhra Pradesh. The state has been demanding special status ever since it was bifurcated with the formation of Telangana. ""People should know that I spared no effort..I went to Delhi 29 times to meet the PM and Union Ministers. But they ignored our requests. We got nothing but promises,"" Naidu recalled, adding that he waited patiently for four years but now his patience has run out.    ",2018-03-07,, TDP pulls out of NDA govt: 'Unavailable' Modi failed to address Naidu's concerns | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/tdp-pulls-out-of-nda-govt-unavailable-modi-failed-to-address-naidu-s-concerns-102046.html

The project named “Ekushe Annapurna” will kick off from 1 May and makeshift canteens will be set up in different locations in the state to provide food to the people. The meal provided would contain dal, rice, vegetables and fish curry. The rates are highly subsidised. One plate of non-vegetarian food will be Rs 21 and one vegetarian meal would be just Rs 10. The main objective is to provide the poor clean and nutritious food at a minimal price. Ekhushe Annapurna project is based on the Amma canteens in Tamil Nadu and Indira canteens in Karnataka.  The first phase of canteens will be set up near Rashbehari Avenue, Ruby Hospital and Gariahat in Kolkata. A senior official of the state government said “We conducted a survey and found that there is demand for cooked food , especially in remote village where people have to walk a few miles to get their food. As a result we have decided to set up canteens so that people do face difficulty in getting a wholesome meal. It was decided that the canteens will be run by women’s self-help groups”. It may be mentioned that in most states, the food that is served in these canteens is keeping in mind the local diet and preferences. In Rajasthan, the Annapurna canteens serves traditional dishes like khichdi, rice and dal. In Andhra Pradesh, idli and curd rice can be found on the menu while in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Canteen provides roti, rice, dal and vegetables. . In  Orissa , the canteens serve dalma, a traditional lentil dish with vegetables. According to West Bengal’s food minister Jyotipriyo Mullick, “The project will help the poor get cooked food at an affordable price and our main objective is to provide balanced wholesome meal to reduce malnutrition.” According to Opposition parties, the project has been started to woo the poor ahead of the Panchayat elections.

""We referred the Bill to the Select Committee, we allowed the ordinance to get lapsed and when it is not a law yet, then what should we withdraw? However, we are taking the Bill back from the Select Committee,"" Raje said in the House amid an uproar by members of the opposition.   On September 2017, the Rajasthan government brought The Criminal Laws (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2017 with an intention to muzzle the press. It was an act of legislative conspiracy that came in action overnight. Also, the media did not have an iota of the Bill.  The Rajasthan Patrika was the first Newspaper who broke the story about it.

464,Rajeev Khanna,"The developments in Gujarat after the self-immolation by the Dalit rights activist Bhanubhai Vankar have a strong political message. The message is that the Dalit land rights issue has assumed the proportion of a cluster bomb that has the potential to blow up in the face of the   (BJP) time and again. The Dalit uprising is there to stay and forge ahead in the days to come. Vankar had set himself aflame to protest against the delay in allotment of land to a landless Dalit family that had paid Rs 22,200 five years back. Vankar's funeral was eventually carried out in Unjha after a series of events over the last three days that also saw the police detaining Dalit activist and now Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani, protests at various places by Dalits and Vankar's family refusing to accept his dead body from the morgue in Gandhinagar after a post mortem till Mevani was released. The funeral was carried out only after the Gujarat government was reportedly compelled to accept demands on land allocation to Dalits and forming a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe Vankar's death. It is probably one of the rare occasions that the RSS also saw a 'political wisdom' over the manner in which things were unfolding that it came out with a statement condemning Vankar's death. It is definitely for the first time that the RSS came out with such a statement ever since the BJP came to power in the state in 1995. The statement read, “Death of social activist Bhanubhai Vankar who belonged to Scheduled Caste is a painful and a tragic event. Instead of getting relief from the pain he was suffering from long over the alleged delay in allotment of land, he had to take this extreme step. It is indeed shameful and unfortunate event.” It further read, “RSS is standing with families who are suffering from this pain and we expect that the authorities would look into this sensitive matter holistically and do the needful to ensure the affected families get speedy justice. It is also important for the government to make sure the civil authorities take speedy actions on the decisions taken for the betterment of people. RSS also appeals to the people to maintain peace and tolerance.” The RSS had maintained a stoic silence even after the Una incident more than a year ago when Dalits skinning animal carcass had been publicly flogged by cow vigilantes. The incident had proved to be a landmark in Dalit uprising in the state. Reports suggest that the RSS’ new found empathy for Dalits may have its genesis in the resignation of senior ideologue Mulchand Rana in December over widening rift between the lower castes and other sections of Hindus. Rana, a Dalit who had joined the RSS in 1970 was reportedly appalled with RSS and BJP for not being serious about Dalit atrocities and discrimination in Gujarat. Leading Dalit rights activist Martin Macwan says, “The unrest over the land rights issue is only going to grow in the coming days along with other issues pertaining to Dalits. The helplessness of the local administration in Patan in this case once again is a pointer to the conflict between the political set up, the administration and the people. There has been no political will to resolve issues.” He says that the RSS issuing a statement in this case is a response coming out of political wisdom which is “too little and too late”. “The issue of land rights for the Dalits is more than two decades old and yet nothing has been done about it. The people have lost patience,” he said. It needs to be pointed that post Una episode the Dalits in Gujarat have been much more of an organised political force that ever before. A mere seven per cent of the population and that too a highly scattered lot, this segment has largely remained ignored in the political framework. But the victory of Jignesh Mevani in the recent assembly polls from Vadgam have taken things to a different direction. The BJP had tried its best to ensure is defeat. It knows very well that the Dalit uprisings and agitations may not have much of an impact in Gujarat but the message these send across India can do massive political damage to the party in other states and at the national level. It was none other than the BJP heavyweights including Prime Minister  , party's national president   and chief ministers of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh Vijay Rupani and   who had held rallies within a radius of 15 km to 20 km of Vadgam and even in the constituency, focusing their attack on Mevani. “Bhanubhai's wife insisting that her family would receive his body only after Jignesh's release from detention is an indication how much the Dalits have posed their faith in one leader from the community. Another thing that has changed is that Dalit leaders from other outfits who were critical of Jignesh have now come to terms that they might as well keep fighting for space within their community but outside they have to back Jignesh for their common cause. The manner in which the government was compelled to accept the Dalit demands this time also shows that it can no longer continue to take people for a ride by fielding middlemen like local MLAs or party leaders who make promises that dilute the anger at that point of time and are never fulfilled later,” points out Mehul Manguben, a social activist and a keen political observer from the Dalit community. Jignesh has definitely been keeping the BJP leadership on its toes. He was detained along with his aides from Sarangpur area of Ahmedabad on Sunday while he was on his way to a protest venue during a bandh called by the Dalits. His forays into eastern Ahmedabad have been keeping the BJP on tenterhooks as this part of the city has a substantial number of Dalit population not only from Gujarat but from other states as well. It is a well known fact that many Dalits were used by the groups indulging in anti Muslim pogrom of 2002 post Godhra train burning incident. These Dalits have also been the backbone of Hindutva groups that have been carrying out anti-minority propaganda and ensuring BJP victory in several constituencies of this nerve centre of Gujarat politics. The possibility of Dalits being weaned away is not good news for the Hindutva groups. There is a massive resentment among the Dalits over Jignesh's detention and the police having a press conference to explain how he misbehaved using “unparliamentary” words and how the police would be sending a report to Gujarat Assembly Speaker on his conduct. The Dalits are pointing that while Jignesh being an educated leader should not use unparliamentary words, it is for the police to explain how many times they have sent reports of misconduct by BJP MLAs and MPs to the Speaker of either the state assembly or the Lok Sabha. They claim that such instances of misconduct by BJP and other Sangh Parivar leaders galore. The Dalits have also been saying that the police should instead be writing to the Speaker and the Governor on how the failure of the government to address public issues adds to their woes in terms of handling law and order problems that stem from the government failures.",2018-02-19,, Bad news for BJP: The Dalit upsurge in Gujarat is only going to grow | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bad-news-for-bjp-the-dalit-upsurge-in-gujarat-is-only-going-to-grow-99932.html
465,Catch Team,"  “ “ “In 1977, when  Congress candidate  V Lasuh faced disqualification during an election in  Nagaland's  Phek district,  the then Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi sent her own lawyer to sort the problem out. Subsequently, in the  ' 90s  the Grand Old Party ran the government in the state for 10 straight years  under veteran SC Jamir.  It had no  opposition  in half of those years .  Today,  however,  ’s Congress  hardly shows any  interest in  the northeastern state . Ditto  for  Tripura, where  the  party has  ceded  the non-Left space to the    (BJP) .  With Assembly elections round the corner, the  Congress leaders  are reportedly reduced to  campaigning out of their home s . “ N either  are there  funds nor  the  motivation to fight back,” a senior  state party  leader  said . The Congress  couldn't  even find candidates  for  half the seats.  Just ahead of filing nominations, a young leader and old loyalist Medokul Sophie quit the party and joined the Nationalist People’s Party.  He  was suspended  last month  by party leader K.Therie,  alleging  factionalism. “It was then that the central leadership decided to send a leader  here . Nagaland in-charge CP Joshi visited the state for the first time in  the  three years since he took charge,” Sophie  said .  At one time the only national party to have  a  strong presence in the frontier states, despite insurgency, is today virtually non-existent. As for election campaigning, the party has little to do except issuing press releases from time to time.  Bete noire  BJP,  on the other hand,  has a long list of campaigners  including PM   and state in-charge Kiren Rijiju.  The party  has been camping in the state for days. In contrast,  the  Congress sent its secretary Jayakumar and MP Gaurav Gogoi who camped for  a couple of  days at former president I Imkong’s Dimapur residence.  Rahul Gandhi may come after  22  February,”  said  senior leader Imkong, unsure whether  the party chief would  actually make  the  trip. “We have  put a proposal; now  it is up to them,” he  added . Gandhi has shown little interest in wresting back the states  that  were traditionally Congress bastions, with the exception of some interest in Meghalaya.  The last  time  a senior leader  was  seen in the state was during the 2013 elections when   addressed a rally in Dimapur. “It is up to the AICC to decide,”  said  Therie, who is contesting an uneven battle in Pfutsero.  Crestfallen and neglected, the ground machinery has disappeared; cadres have joined regional parties like the Naga People’s Front and  the  newly created Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party. “There is no interest by the central leadership even to put up a symbolic fight,” a senior Congress  candidate said.  Even in  the  early  ' 90s, under Narasimha Rao, senior leaders visited the state and offered a unilateral ceasefire to the  National Socialist Council of Nagaland  (Isak-Muivah). “This paved  the  way for peace negotiations; and look at us now,”  a  leader  said  in  discernible  self pity.  From former chief minister Neiphiu Rio now leading NDPP and Therie to former  CM  TR Zeliang and  his  followers, everyone learned the political ropes with the Congress. First due to Jamir’s one-man leadership and later due to the central leadership’s disinterest, the party simply disappeared even from the Naga mindspace.  My people wanted me to contest elections and clearly not on a Congress ticket,”  said  Medokul,  who is   contesting from Southern Angami-1. Chances of reviving the  GOP  were missed by the state and central units alike.  During  the second innings of the United Progressive Allaince government at in New Delhi,  the central leadership wanted Rio to return to the Congress fold, but the local unit was against it. Factionalism has been the bane of the party across the country and Nagaland is no exception.  Today, the party has reached a juncture where it has to even declare support to former opponent NPF. “We will support secular parties where we are not contesting,” Therie announced recently.  Even his party seemed to believe that  a fight by the Congress  w ould have been worth it. One NPF source  said  that in  the  face of the NDPP-BJP alliance, the NPF would not mind taking support from a few Congress MLAs in the scenario of a hung  A ssembly.  The problem with the Congress announcement about supporting us is that they hardly have any cadres on the ground,” an NPF source  said . For the BJP and NDPP, the deafeatist tendency of the Congress is  the  recipe for filling up a vacuum for a non-existent  O pposition.  Even in Tripura,  the  absence of campaigning or failure to prevent the BJP from poaching its MLAs the BJP is devouring the non-Left space left behind. In Nagaland, an anti-incumbency against NPF has resulted in benefits to the NDPP-BJP combine as the Congress washes its hands off Nagaland. ",2018-02-20,, Nagaland Assembly polls: Congress has ceded ground almost to point of no return | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/nagaland-assembly-polls-congress-has-ceded-ground-almost-to-point-of-no-return-100086.html

469,Rajeev Khanna,"Visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was reportedly accorded a cold reception by the Centre and authorities in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh but Punjabis made up for that by giving him a red carpet welcome at Amritsar on Wednesday. The manner in which ordinary Punjabis welcomed him is actually a slap on the face of those who tried to spread fear by raising the bogey of Khalistan on the eve of his arrival. This includes sections of the media who have been known to play mischief on different occasions. Trudeau and the Canadian authorities have consistently been saying that they do not support the idea of Khalistan. Moreover, the issue itself is a dead horse. On Tuesday he had reportedly said that Canada is strongly committed to 'one united India' and is serious about cracking down on extremism. ""Canada has been unequivocal - myself, all my ministers and our government - on a policy of one united India. We have, we have been very strong on that and we'll continue to be,"" he said. He reportedly said that Canada will never support any separatist movement in India or anywhere else in the world. The warm reception given by Punjabis is also a strong political statement to Prime Minister  , who seems to have consciously given cold treatment to Trudeau by not receiving him at the airport or accompanying him to Gujarat. This is in sharp contrast to the manner in which Modi sat on the swing with Xi Jinping of China and took Japan’s Shinzo Abe for a roadshow in Gujarat. The welcome by the people of Punjab is also a message for Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh who is seen to be making a complete 'U' turn with regards to the present ruling dispensation in Canada. It needs to be recalled that he had refused to meet Canadian defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan last year and had gone to the extent of calling him a 'Khalistan sympathiser'. This time a meeting between him and Trudeau was finalised at the eleventh hour as there were doubts that Trudeau may not opt for a tit for tat approach and not meet him which would have caused a lot of embarrassment. As a result, Captain ended up meeting not just Trudeau but also Sajjan, whom he had refused to meet last year. Observers say that it is a fact that there are elements in Canada and elsewhere who have been supporting the cause of Khalistan and some Canadian politicians do attend events organized by them. But the question being raised is that why the bogey of Khalistan is raised only in connection with Trudeau and his party who are liberal, and not the others. Observers also feel that by including visits to prominent places of different faiths in his itinerary, Trudeau has himself sent across a strong message on secularism to India and its politicians. In fact people are also comparing how democracy functions and how minorities are treated in India and Canada. Wednesday had seen Punjabis taking to the social media in a big way posting messages welcoming Trudeau. There were even advertisements in the local publications by various individuals welcoming him and his family who are on a week-long visit to India. In common Punjabi parlance, the people these days talk of three Punjabs in the world –the Punjab in Pakistan, the Punjab in India and the Punjab that has come up in Canada. These Punjabs may be divided by political boundaries but there is still much common in terms of ethos. Trudeau and his family offered prayers at Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar on Wednesday. Clad in Punjabi outfits, Trudeau, his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and two of their three children also performed Sewa. Earlier they were received at the Amritsar airport by Punjab's culture and tourism minister Navjot Sidhu and union minister of state for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, who is also a former diplomat. He was also welcomed by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal and Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal. After the Harmandir Sahib visit, Amarinder met Trudeau and six other members of his team including Sajjan. The manner in which attempts were made to cold shoulder the Canadian leader's visit came in for criticism from various corners. The most vocal has been the hardline Dal Khalsa whose spokesperson Kanwar Pal Singh said that by cold-shouldering Trudeau, India is undermining its image in the eyes of the world community. He said diplomacy is a two way street and the Ministry of External Affairs has managed to convince Trudeau to meet Amarinder to save the latter's face as he has been toeing the line of the Modi dispensation. Expressing the apprehension of Sikhs, he said they are worried about the under-currents as Trudeau's visit has been used by the Modi govt to pit majority community against minority. Another party leader H S Dhami said that Sikhs as a people have political aspirations of nationhood based on their distinct identity, history and legacy. Exercising their rights in a forceful way does not make it similar to extremism or as some would even label it terrorism. “We expect that Canadian government would continue to honour this distinction,” he remarked. The Aam Aadmi Party also criticised the Centre for how it has treated Trudeau. Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Sukhpal Singh Khaira said that Punjabis and Sikhs feel deeply hurt at the lack of respect shown by Modi towards Trudeau.",2018-02-21,, Punjabis snub Modi and Captain by giving Justin Trudeau a grand welcome  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/punjabis-snub-modi-and-captain-by-giving-justin-trudeau-a-grand-welcome-100234.html
470,Anurag Dey,"Hearing the “Kerala Love Jihad case”, the Supreme Court on Thursday questioned if a High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction, can annul the marriage of a “vulnerable adult”. The case concerns Kerala woman Akhila Ashokan’s conversion to Islam and her subsequent marriage to a Muslim man Shafin Jahan. She took the name of Hadiya after conversion. Following a petition of habeas corpus by Hadiya’s father, Asokan KM, the Kerala High Court in May 2017 annulled her marriage, terming it a “sham” and directed her to return to her parents. An apex court bench in August 2017 had ordered the NIA to investigate after it was contended that Hadiya case was not isolated and there could be more instances of “love jihad” in Kerala. Jahan subsequently approached the apex court appealing against the High Court order annulling his marriage. He also sought the withdrawal of the NIA probe into the marriage  The questioned was posed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra headed bench after Asokan’s counsel made a submission of “vulnerable adults” while defending the High Court verdict.  “The judgment was rendered by the High Court in exercise of the ‘parens patriae’ jurisdiction, not in its strict sense but in respect of a vulnerable adult,” said the counsel citing the doctrine that grants the inherent power and authority of the state to protect persons who are legally unable to act on their own behalf.  “The parens patriae jurisdiction was applied by the HC considering the facts and circumstance of the case… there is an enormous trafficking exercise,” said the counsel claiming Hadiya’s marriage was just a “charade”.  But the bench appeared unconvinced by the arguments. The court observed: Hadiya who has been made a party to the petition, on Tuesday filed an affidavit affirming her conversion to Islam and marriage to Jahan was voluntary and out of her own free will.  She also sought restoration of her liberty as she continues to be under police surveillance, and urged the court to appoint Jahan as her guardian. She also claimed that her father is under the influence of ""certain section"" of people, who ""played and are still playing behind my father"". All those errant personnel, both official and non-official, who subjected or caused to subject me to the ""horrendous torture and torment"" are liable to be brought to justice, she said in the affidavit. She also referred to the “mental and physical harassment” suffered by her during the wrongful confinement at the hostel as well as her parental home and the NIA treating her like a terrorist.",2018-02-22,, Hadiya case: SC once again questions HC’s power to annul marriage   | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/hadiya-case-sc-once-again-questions-hc-s-power-to-annul-marriage-100351.html
471,Charu Kartikeya,"It is hard to recall when was the last time in India's military history that a serving Army Chief faced as much flak as General Bipin Rawat is facing right now. The General gave a short  at a seminar on the 'North East Region of India' and managed to send a series of controversial signals in a matter of less than 8 minutes . From political analysis to language divide and from demographics to foreign affairs commentary, the General was all over the place. With enough ammunition for controversy on multiple counts, he has left observers, analysts and commentators either angry or baffled. Speaking on bridging gaps in the region and securing the country's borders, Rawat appeared to stress that the region's population dynamics were a problem and then went on to expound on how to solve the problem. Firstly, it is hardly the Army Chief's place to speak on 'population dynamics', the rise of one political party versus another, use of one language as a unifier and blaming neighbouring countries for a “proxy warfare”. So far, these issues were hit upon by politicians in election rallies to reach out to their respective vote banks. Does the Army Chief have a vote-bank to speak to? If not, what did he intend to convey by trying to sound alarm bells about the rise of the regional party, All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF)? Is he essentially saying that the rise of AIUDF in Assam means that the Muslim population is rising faster than that of Hindus and that this must be stopped? That does seem to be the case because he went on to say that Muslims from Bangladesh have altered the demographics in Assam and that this was the result of a conscious strategy deployed by China and Pakistan. This is a deeply troubling insinuation in a state where widespread anxiety is prevailing right now on account of the process of updating National Register of Citizens in Assam. Many fear summary eviction if their names do not make it to the list. In fact, there are reports of detention centres operating in the state where those declared 'foreigners' have been camped. The General's statements run the risk of adding fuel to the fire in the state and deepen the 'native-outsider' divide. This is also the time when three states in the region are going through elections to their respective state assemblies. Polling has already been held in Tripura and it will take place in Nagaland and Meghalaya soon. These states were not specifically mentioned in the Army Chief's speech, but he did talk about the region at large. If that wasn't enough, he went on touch upon another fault-line in the region – language. Talking about the need to 'amalgamate' people from the region into the Indian mainstream, the General implied that Hindi could be a tool for this because people in Arunachal Pradesh know Hindi well. What is the need to 'amalgamate' people from the region and why does Hindi have to be imposed on them? These are questions that politicians from the Hindi heartland have often been grilled about and they have been forced to baulk. Who will question the Army Chief? Also, the General's statement on China and Pakistan deploying demographic change as strategy for proxy warfare in the region might lead to diplomatic repercussions soon. It will be interesting to see if the government will turn to the Army Chief then.",2018-02-22,, The timing of Army Chief's baffling comments is as important as their context | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/the-timing-of-army-chief-s-baffling-comments-is-as-important-as-their-context-100356.html
472,Rajeev Khanna,"Politics in the hill state of Uttarakhand is on the boil over   (BJP) leaders including the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat expressing their preference for including some areas of western Uttar Pradesh into Uttarakhand. This has stirred a hornet's nest with social activists and the Opposition not only questioning the larger designs of the RSS and the BJP but accusing them of playing with the sentiments of the hill population who had got their statehood after a bloody and prolonged struggle. The BJP leadership has been claiming that the party leaders have been quoted out of context. It was just a couple of days back that Trivendra during his visit to Balaji Dham in Saharanpur district had reportedly said that he was previously also in favour of Saharanpur being a part of Uttarakhand. Prior to this, the Congress turned BJP leader Harak Singh Rawat had also reportedly expressed his desire that some villages of Bijnor be amalgamated into the hill state. One needs to go back a bit into the political history of the region to understand how these remarks cannot be treated as just off the cuff statements. Sources inform that prior to the formation of the state in late nineties, delegations comprising mainly of Hindu traders had approached a committee comprising BJP leaders Kalraj Mishra and present home minister   requesting them that Saharanpur be made a part of Uttarakhand. They contested that a single industrial unit in the district alone contributed excise revenue that was equivalent to the entire budget of the hill districts at that time. Sources say that their requests and views were dumped because the RSS and its affiliates were keen on carving out an upper caste Hindu dominated state that would have eight districts of the hills and 'Kumbh area' of the plains. The things got settled when Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar got added to the eight hill districts and the state was born. Coming back to the present times, sources say that for about a year now there have been rumours doing the rounds in the districts of Bijnor and Saharanpur that they would soon be parts of Uttarakhand. These rumours stem from the speculations that the the BJP and the RSS are rattled by the emerging patterns of Dalit-Muslim unity that have the potential to derail the larger design of the RSS. “It is only in extraordinary circumstances that the BJP manages to win in these areas. This is an unwarranted issue raised by the BJP at this point of time as there is neither a demand from the people of Uttarakhand or those from Uttar Pradesh for the merger of these districts into the state. Had this been the case, there would have been a Harit Pradesh in existence with more districts like Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Moradabad, Rampur and Bareilly in it,” says senior Congress leader Suryakant Dhasmana. “These statements amount to playing with the sentiments of the hill people who wanted a state that could cater to special needs stemming from the hill topography and environment. This is an anti people move,” he added. In context of Harak Singh Rawat talking about including parts of Bijnor district, observers say that he has been repeatedly saying this keeping in mind some 60 to 70 villages that are dominated by people from hill communities. They say that this would increase his area of political influence. In the past there have been repeated agitations by people residing in villages of Uttar Pradesh bordering Uttarakhand calling for their inclusion in the hill state is because of the fact that their neighbours have access to comparatively better facilities in terms of power supply and some other benefits. But now it is the BJP politicians who are talking in terms of including areas of Uttar Pradesh into the hill state. The statements from Trivendra and Harak have come in for scathing criticism from the opposition that has found an emotive issue to play up. The Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) that is seen as force that speaks in the interest of the hill people has threatened to launch an agitation against any such move. Party spokesperson Sunil Dhyani said that the BJP has always played with the sentiments of the people and the existence of the state. “It had previously named the state as Uttaranchal showing sheer disregard for the sacrifices made by the people who fought for statehood. They have done nothing for establishing a permanent capital of the state and have even surrendered when it came to distribution of assets with Uttar Pradesh.” He said that the UKD will never accept any move to merge parts of Uttar Pradesh into the hill state. CPI(ML) leader Indresh Maikhuri in a post on Facebook has posed a question to Trivendra saying, “Only time will tell whether Saharanpur becomes a part of Uttarakhand or not but tell us what you have given to the state in the last 17 years that you want to give to Saharanpur? Had there been any other party in power in Uttar Pradesh you would have said that since there is no development in Saharanpur, it should be merged with merged with Uttarakhand so that it is developed. Through your comments you have placed the BJP in a corner.” ""The demand for Uttarakhand was one for a hill state so that policies could be framed and implemented keeping in mind the special socio cultural environment and tough geographical conditions. The governments that have been elected over the last 17 years have demolished this concept instead of doing anything to realise it. Trivendra's statement is an addition in this direction.” Despite BJP leaders like the state unit chief Ajay Bhatt issuing statements saying that Trivendra has been quoted out of context, this controversy is unlikely to die down soon.",2018-02-22,, Why Uttarakhand BJP leaders want parts of Western UP included in their state | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-uttarakhand-bjp-leaders-want-parts-of-western-up-included-in-their-state-100362.html

476,Akash Bisht,"As political parties slug it out for the Assembly elections in the North East, another round of elections in April could hold the key to BJP's fortunes in the Rajya Sabha. Ever since it registered an emphatic win in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP has not been able to assert itself in the Upper House the way it wants to despite winning most of the state Assembly elections since then. At present, the ruling party has 58 members in the Rajya Sabha and its electoral victories across states since 2014 will certainly help it beef up its presence there. However, even these victories will not help the party and its alliance partners to cross the majority mark, which should come as a major relief to the Opposition. Nearly one-fourth of Rajya Sabha members retire every two years and it is for this reason that political parties will spar for 58 seats that go to polls later in March. Last week, the Election Commission announced that polls for these seats would be held on 23 March with results being announced the same day. BJP's winning streak in state Assembly elections since 2014 has not yet helped the saffron party in increasing its presence in the Upper House. Wins in states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, among others, will now pay dividends as BJP looks to try and win as many seats as it can from these states. The ruling party sees the upcoming biennial elections as an opportunity to counter the Opposition that has used the Upper House as an effective platform to attack the government over its politics and policies. Meanwhile, out of the 58 seats that are up for grabs, UP leads the pack with with 10 seats followed by Bihar and Maharashtra (6 seats), Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal (5 seats each), Gujarat and Karnataka (4 seats each), and three seats each in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Rajasthan. Of the 10 seats in UP, BJP is certain to win eight while SP will win one and the remaining seat could go to any of the parties in the fray. A combined Opposition could get one seat but it remains to be seen whether these parties can put up a united front to deny BJP yet another seat. Interestingly, Jaya Bachchan whose term expires in April is looking for a return to Rajya Sabha as a Trinamool Congress candidate. Bachchan was representing SP in the Upper House but that is not likely to happen now. Four members retire from West Bengal in April and out of these three are expected to go to TMC with one remaining seat expected to be won by Congress and CPM. This is even more interesting considering how the CPM has shot down the idea of having an alliance with Congress before the 2019 polls. It remains to be seen whether the party agrees to vote for a consensus candidate in the upcoming polls. Meanwhile, the saffron party is expected to win seats in Uttrakhand, Jharkhand, Haryana and Maharashtra. In order to counter a united Opposition, it remains crucial that BJP allies remain committed to the party to help it win seats that could go either way. It is here that BJP could find itself in an uncomfortable position since some of its allies have not been so forthcoming in its support for the party. A tough contest is on the cards in Andhra where TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu is unlikely to help BJP in winning any new seats. In the previous biennial elections held in 2016, Naidu had given Union minister   a seat from his kitty which is unlikely to happen considering how the Andhra chief minister has raised the banner of revolt against the central government over providing special status to the state. Three members from the state are retiring in April this year. Similarly, in Maharashtra, it is going to be an intriguing contest since a lot would depend on the   that has been on the warpath with the BJP in upcoming polls. If the Sena chooses to not support the BJP in the Rajya Sabha polls, it should be a cause of concern for party strategists in the run up to the 2019 polls. Meanwhile, the ruling party is expected to lose two seats in Gujarat where Congress put in a spirited performance in the recently held Assembly elections. The party is also expected to lose one seat in Bihar but that won't be such a shock considering its alliance partner JD(U) could win the remaining seats. Despite these gains, BJP is still away from securing a majority in the Upper House where it has faced resistance by a united Opposition that has been successful in stopping the passage of several bills. It is for this reason that the ruling dispensation has chosen to introduce many Bills as Money Bills which do not necessarily need the approval of the Upper House. What has made these elections even more intriguing is the fact that eight ministers in the Modi cabinet will also have to seek re-election in order to continue working in the government. While none of them are likely to be dropped, they will have to contest from other states in order to continue as ministers. In fact, Union Finance Minister  , who was elected from Gujarat, will have to face re-election and it is not yet certain whether he would seek re-election from the prime minister's home state. Except for Jaitley, the term of two more ministers of state – Parshottam Rupala and Mansukh Mandaviya – ends this April. Considering the fact that the saffron party is expected to win only two seats from Gujarat, speculations are rife that the two ministers of state could be re-elected from the state with Jaitley choosing another state to re-enter Rajya Sabha. Similarly, term of Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan, Thawar Chand Gehlot,  ,   and JP Nadda too will retire in April. While Gehlot is expected to be renominated from MP, Javadekar could be shifted to Maharashtra. The remaining ministers could be sent to another states where BJP is sure shot of securing seats for them. The upcoming biennial elections will certainly help the BJP in improving his tally in the Rajya Sabha but it needs support of regional partners to secure more seats to take on the Opposition. However, even with the support of its regional allies, NDA will not cross the majority mark and the Opposition will continue its tirade against the government which should concern the BJP. Despite the gains in these elections, BJP would continue to remain vulnerable to attacks from a united Opposition.",2018-02-26,, Rajya Sabha polls: BJP to increase its tally but it will still be in a minority | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/rajya-sabha-polls-bjp-to-increase-its-tally-but-it-will-still-be-in-a-minority-100890.html
477,Sulagna Sengupta,"Former football captain Bhaichung Bhutia resigned from the All India Trinamool Congress on  . He was the party's working president in Darjeeling district and chairman of North Bengal Board for Development of Games and Sports. The speculation is that he had a fallout with the party leadership over the Gorkhaland issue.   Announcing his decision Bhutia tweeted, “As of   I have officially resigned from the membership and all the official and political posts of All India Trinamool Congress party. I am no longer a member or associated with any political party in India”. “I want to concentrate on football and that’s why I have decided to resign from Trinamool Congress,” he said over phone. Sources in Trinamool said that Bhutia's relations with the party soured soon after the 2014 Lok Sabha election, in which he lost to BJP’s SS Ahulwalia in Darjeeling. He was not given any big posts in the party. On his part, Bhutia shook the and the party leadership received a jolt after Bhutia said that he supported the Gorkhaland movement and expressed his unhappiness over the state government’s handling of the agitation for a separate state. A senior Trinamool leader disclosed that party supremo Mamata Banerjee had warned Bhutia against keeping in contact with Sikkim Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling and the BJP unit in Sikkim during the Gorkhaland agitation. The Trinamool dispensation's relation with the Chamling regime soured last year after the Sikkim CM expressed displeasure and concern at the way the Bengal government handled the Gorkhaland agitation. In the absence of an airport, the only way to approach hilly, landlocked Sikkim from within India is through Bengal. Sources close to Bhutia said that he expected AITC to nominate him to the Rajya Sabha, which did not happen. DB Chauhan , BJP’s Sikkim state committee president said “ We have urged Bhutia consider joining our party in Sikkim . He has not given any positive reply as yet but we are in touch with him.” Assembly elections in Sikkim are scheduled for 2019. Both the ruling Sikkim Democratic Front and the Opposition Sikkim Krantikari Morcha are trying to woo Bhutia. The AITC is downplaying Bhutia's exit. According to West Bengal parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee, “We have seen his resignation only on social media. We have not receive it from him officially. Many celebrities have joined Trinamool but some of them were unable to stay in politics as they need to concentrate on their careers”. However, the BJP sees this as the result of Banerjee's style of functioning. State BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said, ""We have heard that many AITC could not cope up with Banerjee as she does not give space to have their opinion . We feel that Bhutia also felt the same and resigned from the party."" Currently Bhutia is holidaying with his family members in Thailand. Bhutia joined AITC in 2013 but his foray didn't prove to be successful. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections he lost to the BJP from Darjeeling and in the 2016 Assembly elections, he was defeated by CPI(M) leader Ashok Bhattacharya in Siliguri.",2018-02-26,, Bhaichung Bhutia quits Trinamool.

His comments flagging the idea of holding all elections in the country simultaneously, which Prime Minister   is a strong votary of, must be seen in this light.  A Parliamentary panel had considered the issue and had recommend in December 2015 that the terms of various state Assemblies be artificially altered to implement the project. It is this artificial clubbing that Mukherjee appeared to have been referring to while making the argument about denial of states' rights. ",2018-02-24,, Citizen Pranab snubbing Prez Pranab shows failure of the President in rising for the Republic | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/pov/citizen-pranab-snubbing-prez-pranab-shows-failure-of-the-president-in-rising-for-the-republic-100619.html
480,Atul Chandra,"The 2007 case made headlines after Adityanath, who was arrested and jailed for a brief period, wept uncontrollably in the Lok Sabha to plead his innocence in the January 2007 incident in which a youth was killed in clashes between two groups during a Muharram procession in Gorakhpur. Following the death of the youth, it is alleged, Adityanath made provocative speeches to seek revenge. A division bench of Justice Krishna Murari and Justice Akhilesh Chandra, who heard the writ petition filed by Parvez Parvaz and Asad Hayat seeking probe by an independent agency as the state police’s CB-CID was “deliberately delaying and impeding investigation”, said: “We do not find any procedural error in the conduct of the investigation.” The judges also did not find any wrong in “the refusal to grant sanction or any other illegality in the order, which may require any interference by this court”. The state government had refused sanction to prosecute Adityanath and four other BJP leaders after the party came to power. The state home department, which is under Adityanath who holds the Home portfolio, claimed that the video evidence of his speech sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in October 2014 was “edited and tampered”. The petitioners’ contention was that the DVD sent for forensic analysis was not the one submitted by him. Their counsel S Farman Naqvi said, “The CD we had submitted to the Gorakhpur court in 2008 was received in November 2017 by the high court along with the records of the Gorakhpur CJM’s court, it was opened in the presence of both judges and found in a sealed cover. When a CD is found intact by the HC then it should have asked which CD was examined by the forensic lab in 2014.” Naqvi described the verdict as “hopelessly disappointing” and the findings “illegal and contrary to facts”. Parvaz now plans to move the Supreme Court. The high court on 1 February upheld a lower court order granting Adityanath and others relief from prosecution in the hate speech case of 2007. Filed by one Rasheed Khan, the petition challenged the verdict of the sessions court which dismissed the Gorakhpur CJM’s order taking cognizance of the sanction granted in 2009. Dismissing Rasheed Khan’s petition, Justice Bala Krishna Narayana said: “No interference with the impugned order is warranted. This application lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed. However, by way of abundant caution, CJM (chief judicial magistrate) Gorakhpur, is directed to decide the matter afresh pursuant to the impugned order of remand strictly in accordance with law and in the exercise of his unfettered independent discretion, without being influenced by observations, if any, made by the revisional court in the impugned order.” The high court remanded the case back to the Gorakhpur court and asked the lower court to also consider Rasheed Khan’s plea to argue against the rejection of sanction. Claiming partial victory, Farman Naqvi, who also represented Rasheed Khan, said, “Our application has been partially dismissed. The order has gone in our favour because it gives scope for re-examination of the merits of the case by the judicial magistrate and a chance to put forward our arguments, something we were denied last time. We might also move the Supreme Court.” Additional Advocate-General Manish Goel, who represented the state, told the Indian Express, “Cognizance of prosecution sanction was taken by judicial magistrate. But that cognisance order was set aside by a Sessions judge on behalf of the accused last year on the grounds that it was not applicable in the eyes of the law.” The Gorakhpur police filed a charge-sheet after the 2007 riots stating that the accused had participated in spreading disharmony under section 153 A of the IPC, which required state sanction prior to prosecution. This sanction was said to have been given in January 2009 and the chief judicial magistrate took cognisance of the sanction. In 2014, one of the accused moved a revision application challenging the cogniance order in the court of additional sessions judge Shiva Nand Singh, who held that the CJM’s order was “bad in law and without jurisdiction” as it was not signed by the designated authority. Rasheed Khan then moved the High Court. After the dismissal of the two petitions against him for inciting communal violence, Adityanath has just one more case to contend with. In 1999, VK Srivastava, the station house officer of Kotwali police station of Maharajganj district, bordering Nepal, lodged an FIR against Adityanath, who was then a BJP MP and 24 other named accused under various sections of the IPC, including murder. The IPC sections, besides 307 (murder), under which the case was registered included, criminal intimidation (506), promoting communal disharmony (153A), trespassing on burial spaces (297), defiling/ destroying/ damaging any place of worship with the intention of insulting the religion of any class. According to the FIR number 43/99 lodged by SHO VK Srivastava Adityanath, armed with guns and rifles, and his supporters reached Pachrukhia village in 14-15 vehicles and started making provocative speeches and then reached a graveyard, raising slogans. They started breaking graves and planting peepul saplings. “When we policemen opposed this, Adityanath began to threaten us and began making provocative speeches to incite communal passion,” the SHO stated in his FIR. The police FIR said that 13 persons were arrested on the spot but “Adityanath fled with his supporters towards Maharajganj”. They reached a place where   leader Talat Aziz was addressing her party workers. “On being exhorted by Adityanath, his supporters began firing at the SP workers while fleeing towards Maharajganj. Talat Aziz’s security guard, Head Constable Satya Prakash Yadav, was grievously injured. Three others, Afaq Ali, Najmulla and Ishrat, were injured in the firing,” the FIR stated. Despite the FIR being filed by the police, the case had dragged on until Adityanath became the Chief Minister. Although Adityanath is the main accused, he did not appear before the lower court where the case was being heard, said Talat Aziz who has been making regular appearances. As the hearings have picked up speed, Aziz is afraid of being harmed. got a shot in the arm on 22 February. The Allahabad High Court dismissed a petition challenging the Uttar Pradesh government’s refusal to sanction prosecution of the Chief Minister and dismissed the demand for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into an alleged hate speech dating back to 2007. Sanction was needed as Adityanath was charged under Indian Penal Code's Section 153 A, which deals with inciting communal violence. With another petition concerning his prosecution having been dismissed earlier this month, Adityanath faces just one more case in which he and several others have been charged with murder, criminal intimidation and inciting communal disharmony.",2018-02-26,, Yogi Adityanath still has one case against him.

481,Catch Team,"Manbo’s lean frame betrayed his determination on what he wants from his future leaders. Sitting by the hearth and sipping Burmese coffee brewed in Indian milk, the young lad spoke his mind to a bunch of journalists and his childhood friends. “Considering what these people do and how they behave, I have no expectations from them,” he said after a pause. The venue is a small house three feet away from the physically non-existent international border between the two countries. Longwa is an oddity of a village and the international border passes through its middle, even splitting the house of the Chief Angh, or king of Longwa, Tonyie. Longwa lies in the Phomching constituency of Nagaland, due for polling on 27 February. It is part of the frontier Mon district that has nine constituencies. Manbo Konyak, a postgraduate in political science and educated in “big cities” like Dimapur and Kohima, is one of the young voters. It is quite natural that he is frustrated with corruption in the political system and the violence that accompanies electioneering in Nagaland. Roads have not been built for years, the power supply system has crumbled, there are hardly any jobs without bribing or political pull and young people travel to big cities for higher education. People seem to feel why not get as much money from the politicians who build palatial houses beside potholed roads. A show of money and muscle is unabashed in this frontier state. “The opposition NPF (Naga People’s Front) is spending huge amounts. One candidate gave a quintal of rice to every family and Rs 1,000 to every voter back in December,” said Chingwang Konyak, president of the newly formed Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP). Konyak was once a member of Parliament from Congress. NDPP, led by former chief minister Neiphiu Rio, and CM TR Zeliang have hired a chopper each, flying around to distant villages to address small groups and particularly, village council chairmen. The   (BJP), an ally of NDPP, has also hired a helicopter to go around the state of hardly two million people. On the face of it, the bombastic issues of “an alien party (BJP)” or “stability and development” are bandied around in the local press. The ground reality, however, is uglier than rosy prose. At Tuli in Mokokchung district, government-appointed Dobashis (interpreters from the British era) stood alongside police forces. Four of these old men donning red jackets had disturbed brows, looking out for trouble. An NDPP worker was literally stoned to death after being accosted by a group from the Opposition. “The NDPP and NPF are fighting and we are telling them to keep the peace but these young men drink and fight,” said N Kumzuk, a Dobashi for 23 years. Mokokchung town, the smallest constituency in the state but also the district headquarters is the hub of political activity for deals. And violence. “There is only the talk of money, money and money and muscle power,” says a hotel employee, T Ao. In neighbouring Wokha constituency, a 93-year-old man’s home was burnt down allegedly by NPF members because his son M Humtsoe is contesting from the   (United). There are two contestants from Wokha village and Humtsoe was not allowed to enter even his own village to campaign. In Nagaland, where the village is the most important unit socially and politically, it is common during elections that a candidate may not be allowed to enter his own village if the opponent is strong enough. Muscle power, in turn, is dependent on money, clan relations and family relations. Disturbances are highest in villages from where more than one candidate is contesting. Wokha, Chuchuyimlang and Merangkong are some villages that are cases in point.  There is a silver lining in this dark political cloud, though. Villager after village, constituency after constituency reported that the undergrounds are keeping away from the elections. “There is hardly any involvement of the undergrounds this time,” said Bannyei Konyak, the gaon burra (GB) or village elder, at Phomching. There are over half-a-dozen outfits in the state, including the National Socialist Council of Nagaland [NSCN] (Isak-Muivah), NSCN (Kitovi-Neokpao), NSCN (Reformation), the proscribed NSCN (Khaplang) and three factions of the Naga National Council, once led by the famous AZ Phizo. Consecutive elections have seen armed men from these insurgent groups getting politically involved. “I have not heard of anyone involvement or movement from their side,” said Chingwang. This year, most groups had advocated “Solution before Election”. They wanted a settlement to the Naga political problem and not hold state elections. Although the BJP and later other political parties did not heed to the call and carried on, the outfits had till the eve of elections not engaged in strong-arm tactics in favour of any party. During the 2003 elections, the NSCN (IM) and NSCN (K) were known to have engaged in favour of one party or the other. SC Jamir saw the end of his career in Nagaland that year and Neiphiu Rio would see his rise. This year money and muscle are visible, sans the guns from the “national workers”.",2018-02-26,, Nagaland polls: Marred by money and muscle | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/nagaland-polls-marred-by-money-and-muscle-100880.html
482,Rajeev Khanna,"The much touted 'Gujarat Model' is definitely proving its critics correct in its home state. The   (BJP) leaders and the form of administration promoted by them seem to have learnt no lessons from the barely managed victory in the recent Assembly polls. For its critics this much-hyped model that was propounded by the Prime Minister   in his avatar as the state's chief minister for more than 13 years is marked by dictatorial functioning that is marked by scant respect for democratic institutions and political opponents. The critics do not appear to be wrong as can be gauged by a series of examples that can be quoted by over the last few days and months. The latest one is the Vadgam MLA and Dalit activist Jignesh Mevani raising apprehensions about his safety in connection with a trail of messages on a Whatsapp group called ‘ADR Police & Media’ on   in which media persons and senior police officials interact. Two videos of policemen beating up a person dressed up like a politician and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister   answering queries on a series of encounters in his state were reportedly uploaded in the group. This was reportedly followed by a senior Ahmedabad Police official saying, “Those who want to be the baap of police and call the police as ‘lakhota’ (marbles) and those who take videos of police should remember that with people like you, the police will be like this. Scores will be settled. ‘Gujarat Police’.” Next came a thumbs up emoji. Raising concerns about his security, Jignesh has tweeted saying, “This is getting really serious. Cops discussing my encounter. So, upon whose instructions will I be killed? Has the order come from Gandhinagar or Delhi?” “This is the real face of the Gujarat Model. If such a thing can be discussed by the police about a sitting MLA one can imagine their attitude towards common people,” says Subodh Parmar, an associate of Jignesh. “We are meeting the state Director General of Police on the issue. First we want to thank the police officers for being candid in their messages on what they plan to do and how it exposes their trail of encounters in Gujarat. We also want to ask the DGP that on whose orders do the police act on such things,” said out social activist Kausharali Saiyed who has been working with Jignesh and others as a part of Dalit Muslim Ekta Manch. Just a couple of days ago, the Ahmedabad Police had denied permission to the Manch for organising a programme in Rakhial area of Ahmedabad that has a sizeable Dalit and Muslim population. The adjoining Bapunagar locality has been a hotbed of Hindutva politics over the last two decades. Apart from Jignesh's felicitation, the programme was to be addressed by youth leaders from Jawaharlal University. “The BJP is jittery after its poor performance in the recent polls and youngsters speaking out against its policies. With intellectuals and mainstream media remaining mum on issues it is the youngsters who are raising the concerns of the masses and this is disturbing the ruling dispensation,” said Saiyed. These two episodes apart, it is the minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja who demonstrated how much disrespect the ruling party has for those not toeing its line. According to this minister the BJP was restricted to just 99 seats in the recent polls because butchers, bootleggers, and those opposing the Triple Talaq Bill did not vote for the party. This was said while speaking on the motion of thanks to Governor O P Kohli’s address to the state assembly on the first day of the budget session. Jadeja reportedly said: “I will tell you who did not vote for us. Butchers who were angry with us for introducing a tough law against the slaughter of cows. Bootleggers were angry because the BJP government has introduced a tough prohibition law.” He said many school owners were unhappy because the government introduced a law to cap fees. “Those who were angry with the BJP government at the centre for introducing a bill to protect Muslim women against triple talaq did not give us votes either. “But we are not bothered about them,” he said. “Did he mean to say that till the time the BJP was winning more than 100 seats in the state, the butchers and bootleggers were voting for Modi and his team,” quipped a senior political observer at Ahmedabad with cynicism. Jadeja incidentally is the same minister who was targeted last year by an individual who hurled shoes at him while he was trying to address the media outside the assembly. While the police had dismissed the assaulter to be a man with an unstable mind, the agitated Gopalbhai Italia had told the media that the attack was on the 'dictatorship and arrogance' of the state government. But still Jadeja's statement on the floor of the house does not come as a surprise. After all, just a few days after the declaration of the Assembly polls it was the BJP MP from Valsad CK Patel who was reported to be threatening government employees and teachers of his constituency from public platforms of Kaprada, Vapi and Pardi not voting in favour of the candidates of his party. The BJP candidates had lost the polls in Kaprada and Dangs by a narrow margin of 171 and 671 votes. Patel's video had gone viral at the time drawing flak from various quarters. ""They draw salaries from BJP government, but vote for Congress. How can this be tolerated? I will see to it that such people are fixed. But, for these teachers and workers, my district of Valsad would have been a Congress-free district,"" Patel had reportedly said in his speech at Pardi. Observers point out Modi himself is known for his scant respect for the Opposition. They point to his speech on   when he had gone to inaugurate the RoRo ferry in Gujarat when in a veiled attack on the Opposition he had warned ‘anti-development forces’ that they will not get any financial support from the centre for public works. This was to send a signal to those mocking his development model that the 'anti-development forces', who (if they came to power), will not get any support from the centre. In the past it has been a norm in the Gujarat Assembly not to allow the Opposition to debate on issues at length. The practice has been to hurriedly pass all the bills towards the end of the sessions when the Opposition has either walked out or has been suspended. However, this time things are expected to change with the presence of new leaders like Jignesh and Alpesh Thakor who have the background of being social activists. Secondly, this time around the strength of the Opposition is also more and the government will find it difficult to bulldoze things. Another factor is that with the former Congress heavyweights having lost the polls, the youngsters including Leader of the Opposition Paresh Dhanani, can give a new meaning to the functioning of the house as they do not carry the baggage of the past when the Congress was seen by many as the 'B' team of the BJP.",2018-02-24,, How Modi's 'Gujarat Model' continues to stand exposed in his home state  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/how-modi-s-gujarat-model-continues-to-stand-exposed-in-his-home-state-100618.html
483,Rajeev Khanna,"Over the last one week there have been indications of strains between the   (BJP) and its ally in Punjab (Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) once again coming to the fore. But this time it was the latter that was complaining of the BJP not treating its allies the way it should be. Amid the flip flops of Akali leaders on this issue as they went on to say that the alliance would continue and is permanent, what needs to be answered is that in the event of the alliance breaking up what have the Akalis got to lose. After all it is the country's oldest regional political force with a strong cadre strength spread across not only in Punjab but it also has its presence in parts of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan. There is a strong view that the Akalis have got nothing to lose in case of their alliance with the BJP breaking breaking up except for a union cabinet berth that is being represented by Harsimrat Kaur Badal who is the wife of the SAD president Sukhbir Badal and the daughter in law of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. The strains between the two parties were reflected last week when the Akali Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Gujral called for the 'Vajpayee touch' from the BJP. Gujral reportedly exhorted the BJP to learn the coalition dharma practiced by the former BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee during his tenure as the prime minister. He was quoted in the media saying, “Coalition politics does not run on arrogance. I think they need to make amends, it needs to be run the way Vajpayee used to run it, they should be more diplomatic.” Gujral further went to reportedly say, “The BJP can’t ride roughshod over their allies. They are not dealing with allies with finesse. They are taking allies for granted, amends are required otherwise it will have disastrous consequences.” The message was clear that the Akalis along with the other BJP allies do not want to act as the big brother ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and are reminding the saffron party that it would require allies if it wants to return power. The next day Gujral went on to say that the breaking of the alliance with the BJP was 'impossible'. His party president Sukhbir Badal too told a section of the media that the Akali relationship with the BJP is permanent. “Our relationship with BJP is a time-tested one, and there is no clash. It’s a relationship that emerged to keep the democratic forces together in Punjab, which borders a hostile country like Pakistan,” he said. But at the same time the Akalis are preparing to go it out all alone in the next Haryana Assembly polls and reports say that they plan to contest no less than 50 of the total 90 seats. But there have been reports saying that the Akalis are upset that the BJP leadership is maintaining a 'negligible social relationship' with allies. Sources have been pointing that how the Akalis were nowhere to be seen campaigning or for that matter attending the swearing in ceremonies for the BJP in the recent Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat elections. They are also upset with the appointments made to minority institutions like National Commission for Minorities and the National Commission for Linguistic Minorities without them being consulted. They have also been pointing at no Sikh being appointed a Governor or a vice chancellor of any of the central universities. A senior Akali leader told Catch that although the alliance continues for now, the Akalis are actually set to gain in the long run if they go ahead on their alone minus the BJP baggage in Punjab. “For now the alliance works on the electoral strategy of the BJP being given urban seats to contest where there is a substantial Hindu population while the Akalis contest the Sikh dominated seats. Both these parties are seen as representative of separate religious identities. But at the same time the Sikhs which are at the core of Akali politics see BJP as a force of the RSS which has two extremes. On one side is the political wing the like the BJP that presents are moderate image and on the other are organizations like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal,” he said. He pointed that in the event of the alliance breaking up, the Sikhs who are now with the Congress or the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) would consolidate behind the Akalis. He pointed that it would be an opportunity for the Akalis to work on the ground pushing forward their clear agenda and consolidate their support base even in the urban areas that are at present the Congress strongholds. Observers have often pointed that the BJP-SAD alliance is one of the most contradictory ones that justifies the saying that 'politics makes strange bedfellows'. This observation is based on the troubled relations between the Akalis and the RSS in the eighties when the militancy was at its peak in Punjab and communal divisions were simmering. Veteran political analyst Jagtar Singh points out, “Even before the period of militancy the RSS had opposed the Akali agitation for the Punjabi Suba by the Akalis. It is also a fact that the Akalis had come to power on their own in the 1985 polls when Surjit Singh Barnala had been made the chief minister.” At the ideological level the RSS takes credit for bringing the Sikhs back into the mainstream of Indian polity by getting the BJP to enter into an alliance with the Akalis after the militancy was on the wane. Observers say that this is true to some extent as this was the time when no one was even willing to talk to the Akalis and Punjab was in for a big surprise when the SAD-BJP combine came to power in 1998. Observers say that by going solitary the Akalis at this point will lose nothing more than Harsimrat's berth in the union Cabinet. In any case the parties opposed to the Akalis in Punjab have often been challenging her to give up the post in the interest of the state. Of late there have been demands also from the BJP cadre for the party going out alone in the coming polls. A section within the BJP feels that the party will have to take a solitary course if it wants to expand in base in Punjab, particularly in the rural hinterland. The alliance stands for now amid rumblings of discontent. It remains to be seen what crumbles first—the rumblings or the partnership.",2018-02-12,, SAD-BJP alliance under strain: Akalis have nothing to lose if they walk out | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/sad-bjp-alliance-under-strain-akalis-have-nothing-to-lose-if-they-walk-out-98742.html
484,Rajeev Khanna,"As the  's (BJP) National President   comes to Haryana for a bike rally, the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government has got down to ensure a perfect picture for him. The BJP will face an arduous task in terms of repeating its 2014 General Election performance, given the fact that the Khattar government has gone from one disaster to another. Jat outfits and farmers' groups have threatened to disrupt his efforts and the state government has begun making friendly overtures towards them to prevent any untoward incident. To begin with, the government is trying its best to pacify the agitated Jats who have threatened to cross roads with BJP's bike rally with a 'Bhaichara Nyay Yatra' on 15 February. The government has reportedly extended an olive branch to the community by deciding to withdraw 85 cases pertaining to the violence during the 2016 Jat reservation agitation. The Haryana government reportedly has approved withdrawal of 85 FIRs against 869 Jat protesters from 13 districts. Majority of these cases are of rioting, unlawful assembly, wrongful restraint, disobedience of orders promulgated by a public servant and obstructing a public servant from discharging duty. At the same time the government has made it clear that there is no move to withdraw cases of heinous crimes like murder and arson. The Khattar government had earlier approved withdrawal of 138 FIRs against 1,158 Jat protesters in March following a truce with the All Indian Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) leader Yashpal Malik last year but a large number of such applications filed by public prosecutors were not accepted by the courts compelling the government to file appeals before the higher courts in some cases. The AIJASS has been accusing the Haryana government of failing to implement the promises made last year and have threatened yet another agitation which the Khattar government can ill afford in the run-up to the polls. The AIJASS has been asking when cases against the Jat agitators would be withdrawn and jobs would be provided to the kin of those killed in the violence of February 2016. The Jats have been questioning when the Bill on National Socially and Educationally Backward Classes would be passed in the Lok Sabha and by when they should expect reservation benefits. The other issues being raised are of the BJP's failure to rope in its leaders like the Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini who have been spewing venom against other communities. On the other hand, the Khattar government has started making overtures to the agitated farmers in this primarily rural state. On Tuesday, the government issued directions to the crop insurance companies to settle the crop insurance claims of farmers under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) within ten days. The farmers have been complaining of the government having amassed money through compulsory collection of insurance premiums while very little has been given to the farmers claiming crop insurance claims. The government however claims that during the Kharif-Rabi season 2016-17, so far Rs 12.86 crore have been distributed on the basis of claims besides Rs 257 crore being distributed on the basis of claims of average production. In yet another major move, Khattar has announced setting up of ‘Haryana Kisan Kalyan Pradhikaran’ (Haryana Farmer Welfare Authority) to make agriculture remunerative, enhance farm productivity and farmer's income, and also to mitigate the physical, financial and psychological distress of farm households and landless workers. Many more such overtures by the state government are expected in the days to come. The BJP workers in the state have been working overtime to make Shah's Jind rally a success. In a recent briefing state BJP chief Subhash Barala claimed that one lakh youngsters would reach Shah's rally on motorcycles. The BJP clearly stands on the back foot in Haryana at present with the state government taking a consistent beating on its failure to tackle the law and order situation on one hand and consistent nuisance of Hindutva elements on the other in terms of cow vigilantism, violence against Dalits and the recent attack on school bus with children on release of Bollywood film Padmavat. The party is not expected to get support from the Jat community that stands annoyed not only on the issue of reservation but the manner in which it was vilified and estranged from the remaining 35 'Biradaris' (communities) after the reservation agitation. Experts say that the Jats who constitute one fourth of the electorate are expected to vote one sided in the coming polls. However they are yet undecided whether to back the Congress or the Indian National Lok Dal. The growing unemployment that has followed demonetisation and shoddy implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is also expected to take a political toll on the party. It remains to be seen how the BJP workers manage to stem the slide in the coming months.",2018-02-09,, Khattar govt tries to set house in order ahead of Amit Shah's Jind visit | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/khattar-govt-tries-to-set-house-in-order-ahead-of-amit-shah-s-jind-visit-98634.html

I feel BJP is trying to divide the country”. Calling Banerjee a “powerful lady”, Patel said “She is the most powerful women politician in India since former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. When she speaks for the masses, she speaks from her heart unlike other politicians who speak just to please the voters.” According to Patel, Banerjee called him “younger brother” and urged him to campaign for Trinamool Congress in the upcoming2019 Lok Sabha elections. Patel said “I will definitely come as Didi has urged me to campaign for Trinamool Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. She called me her younger brother and I will definitely listen to my sister”. “I have also requested her to visit Gujarat for organising a campaign and uniting the women of the state. She has assured me that she will visit Gujarat,” he added. On Friday Banerjee urged Patel to join Trinamool Congress to which Patel said he will keep the offer in mind when he formally decides to join politics. “Some forces are trying to divide the country. I will work hard to unite all parties who are trying to fight against these divisive forces,” he said. It may be mentioned that a day after the results of the Gujarat election were announced , Banerjee had called up Patel and congratulated him for his excellent work.

488,Catch Team,"Miffed with the Union budget, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), RSS's labour wing, is planning to hold a nationwide agitation against the central government over its anti-labour policies. The decision to hold the agitation was taken at the BMS' National Executive Committee which directed all its unions to observe 20 February as Black Day wherein these unions will hold demonstrations, wear black badges and hold gate meetings. Condemning the central government for not keeping its promises made to the BMS delegation on 17 November 2017 after the labour wing held a massive protest rally in Delhi. A statement released by BMS General Secretary Virjesh Upadhyay read: “The protest is against the negligent attitude of Central Government towards labour problems. Indian workers belonging to different Central Trade Unions have put forth burning issues of labour before the government. But the Union Budget 2018 was totally silent about any of the issues raised by Unions.” Further, BMS' executive committee has directed all its districts, states and industrial federations to hold dharnas, huge demonstrations at district headquarters, state capitals and industrial estates on 26 and 27 February. These demonstrations are specifically being done to embarrass the government which will be holding the Indian Labour Conference which is being held in Delhi on these dates. “The conference will be inaugurated by Prime Minister   while the Union Labour minister will preside as chairman. Apart from that several ministers, government officials, among others, would participate in the two day conference which is being held after a gap of three years. If BMS doesn't participate in the conference, it will be a huge embarrassment for the government which has till now ignored all our pleas,” said Pawan Kumar, organising secretary of the BMS. He further claimed that a huge demonstration would be organised outside the ILC venue on 26 February to mount pressure on the central government to resolve labour issues and address demands raised by the BMS. The labour wing has put forth nine demands before the central government which include increasing honorarium of aanganwadi workers and also bringing them under the social security coverage; Reimbursement of cess amount to concerned labour welfare boards affected due to GST; Enhancing EPS pension from Rs1000/ to Rs5000/; Providing special funds to Sick PSUs which can be revived; Hiking Income Tax exemptions to salaried sections up to Rs 5 lakhs; Resolve problems of contract workers; among others. Apart from this, 44 national level industrial federations of BMS also have raised their demands with the respective ministries. BMS is perturbed with the Inter Ministerial Committee, headed by the Finance Minister, for promising to fulfill their demands which have found no mention in the Union Budget. Demanding an immediate review of the Budget to ensure steps to redress their grievances, BMS has warned the government that if it does not pay heed to its demands, it will rethink about participating in the upcoming labour conference. When asked what would the BMS do if the government doesn't oblige to their demands, Kumar said that they would hit the streets and ensure that their demands are met. “If need be, we will organise more protests and do everything in our capacity to ensure that rights of the labour force of this country remain protected,” Kumar added. Earlier on 17 November, the BMS held a massive public rally at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi to protest the “failed promises of the Modi government”. The November rally was organised over the prevailing economic distress in the country. “Though the government claims that there is growth but we believe it is a jobless growth. The Modi government has failed to create any jobs,” Kumar had told Catch. According to Kumar, the Modi government is working on the principles of its predecessor the UPA government and is promoting the policy of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation. “We watch our constituency which is labour and by not protesting I am cheating my constituency. They are snatching the rights of the workers and the SJM can't be a silent spectator to all this,” he had said.",2018-02-09,, Sangh affiliate BMS to embarrass Modi govt with protests over ‘anti-labour’ Budget | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/sangh-affiliate-bms-to-embarrass-modi-govt-with-protests-over-anti-labour-budget-98642.html
489,Charu Kartikeya,"It should be recalled that RSS' founding fathers had unabiding faith in the need for Hindus to militarise in order to consolidate their position and defeat their 'enemies'. In fact, one of the mentors of the organisation's founder KB Hedgewar was well-known for his fascination with Italy's fascists. Balakrishna Shivram Moonje was a president of the Hindu Mahasabha and had  the Nashik-based Central Hindu Military Education Society (CHMES) in 1935. He traveled all the way to Italy to seek inspiration from the founder of fascism, Benito Mussolini. Back with lessons from his trip, Moonje then helped Hedgewar in shaping the RSS and making military training compulsory for its members. Italian scholar Marzia Casolari has pointed out to one of Moonje's diary entries, which states, “The idea of fascism vividly brings out the conception of unity amongst people...India and particularly Hindu India need some such institution for the military regeneration of the Hindus...Our institution of RSS of Nagpur under Dr Hedgewar is of this kind, though quite independently conceived. I will spend the rest of my life in developing and extending this Institution of Dr Hedgewar all throughout the Maharashtra and other provinces."" As a part of this legacy left behind by Moonje and Hedgewar, RSS routinely trains its men how to handle weapons. In fact, on Vijayadashami every year, RSS members worships arms and its members parade through towns across the country, brandishing swords and even  . In an indication of what kind of intentions does the Sangh Parivar harbour, the CHMES-run Bhonsala Military School in Nasik was named in the charge-sheet filed by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad in the 2008 Malegaon blasts probe. The charge-sheet had alleged that the main accused in the blasts had been teaching at the school and that conspiracy meetings were also held there. Aren’t Maoist organisations in India outlawed because of their open espousal of armed action to ensure the victory of the system they believe in? Are the RSS' motivations any different? In many ways they are more sinister because while the Maoists call for overthrow of the government, the RSS is said to have identified specific sections among the country's population as its enemies. It is not hard to imagine what will the foot-soldiers of this philosophy do if they are given a free-hand, which is what Bhagwat appears to be talking about by saying “if situation arises and the Constitution permits”. What dose Bhagwat want to do with an army of Swayamsevaks that he says will be ready in 3 days?RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's comments about the military credentials of the organisation he heads shouldn't be seen in the limited context of disrespect to the Indian Army. RSS has had a long tradition of placing its own beliefs superior to the institutions that have forged and protected the national identity. At the core of the RSS' belief system is a pronounced lack of faith in that document that is said to contain the very soul of India's democracy, the Constitution. Its members have, historically, shown more reverence to their own saffron flag than the national flag. Its former chiefs have openly despised democracy and have been accused of wanting to replace the Constitution itself with manusmriti. For such an organisation, it is easy to consider itself superior to most institutions that represent the country, including the Army. However, Bhagwat's boast about the military readiness of the Swayamsevaks of RSS is a more serious issue than has been considered so far in the wake of his statement. He said in an address delivered in Bihar's Muzaffarpur on 11 February, that “if the need arises and the Constitution permits, it will take 6 months to prepare the Army, but Sangh's swayamsevaks will be ready in 3 days”. The RSS has said that Bhagwat's comments have been misinterpreted and what he meant was that while the Indian army would take 6 months to prepare the society, Sangh swayamsevaks can be trained in 3 days, “as Swayamsevaks practise discipline regularly”.",2018-02-12,, What does Mohan Bhagwat want to do with a private army that will be ready in 3 days? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/what-does-mohan-bhagwat-want-to-do-with-a-private-army-that-will-be-ready-in-3-days-98970.html

On 8 Feb, when Modi cracked that joke, a large number of BJP MPs broke out into instant laughter, on cue, mocking Chowdhury, accompanied by a loud thumping of desks with both hands.

492,Riyaz Wani,"In J&K, the move will benefit the poorer sections of society in cities and towns like Srinagar, Jammu, Kathua and Baramulla. Though the grant of reservation has definite political motivations, it is specifically geared to address the growing urban distress in the state which is believed to underpin the lingering turmoil in the state. ""Urban areas in Valley have been the worst hit by the conflict in the state. The youth in these areas are not covered by any reservation category which puts them at a distinct disadvantage with their counterparts from the countryside,” the minister for Public Works and the state government spokesman Naeem Akhtar told Catch. “This has created a deep alienation and anger in these areas fuelling the unrest”. One such area which has borne the brunt of the lingering conflict is the Downtown, the old densely settled area of Srinagar. Before the start of the armed separatist struggle in 1989, the Downtown was the state’s commercial and political hub. But in the early nineties, the area witnessed the most violence whose fallout is still playing out. Life continues to be prone to hartals and protests in a lingering throwback to the 1990s. The youth remain angry, rebellious and always willing to pick up stones, if no longer the gun, to take on New Delhi. Militancy is now passé, but the still-simmering anger finds its outlet through intermittent bursts of stone-pelting. But along the way, the city’s demographic has also transformed. The elite and the middle class have largely moved out, leaving poor sections of the population behind. The Downtown has now been reduced to a periphery of the expanding Srinagar. Same is more or less the case with the other urban centres like Sopore, Baramulla, Anantnag, Kupwara etc. What is more, the people from urban areas invariably boycott elections “There has been a consequent economic and political disempowerment of the people in the urban centres,” Lone said. “Though it will take time to politically address the situation, the government needs to formulate a suitable administrative response. The reservation for the poor is one such measure”. However, the state remains chary of a legal challenge. “We don’t think there will be one. This is a reservation which will go to the most backward sections of the society,” Lone said. The state, however, takes heart from the fact that the new category for the poor comes within the 50 percent cap on reservations. “We have our system of statutory provisions where we can have something like this,” says Hilal Bhat, the mission director of Integrated Child Protection Scheme, a branch of Social Welfare Department. “Besides, we don’t exceed 50 percent cap”. Pertinently, while the Assembly passed the reservation bill for the poor, it also passed another giving 3 percent reservation to Paharis, a nomadic community. Together, the bills have tried to usher in the reservation politics in the state. Traditionally, the politics in Kashmir has been alien to the reservation-based community movements. Will new reservation categories change this? Only time will tell.In a development of profound political significance, the J&K Legislative Assembly on Saturday, 10 February, passed a bill providing 6% reservation in jobs and admissions in professional colleges of the state for the ""poorest of the poor"". This is the first such reservation in the country which is not based on the community identity, but instead upon the economic criterion. Elsewhere in the country, there are constitutional restrictions on reservations that are based on an ""economic criterion"". The Supreme Court and high courts have cancelled the grant of such quotas by states, making it clear that the community identity was the only marker of social and educational backwardness. In th Indra Sawhney case, the Supreme Court ruled that an exclusive “economic criterion” was unconstitutional. The court explained that the category of “poor” did not reflect “social backwardness” that follows from being born into a caste group considered socially inferior. The court also cautioned that the economic criteria for reservation will allow the upper classes to partake in the affirmative action, thereby defeating the purpose of the reservation scheme. This is why Supreme Court ruled against the reservation for Jats and Marathas. But by virtue of having a separate Constitution, Kashmir's reservation for economically weaker sections may not be easily prone to a legal challenge. And for now, with the Assembly passing the bill, the economically disadvantaged sections of the society can hope to benefit from this reservation. The state Social Welfare minister Sajad Gani Lone who mooted the bill thinks the reservation can make a redeeming difference to the plight of the urban poor who can hope to get “their due share in government jobs and admissions in professional colleges”. “We desperately needed a reservation for economically poor sections of the society, more particularly, the urban poor,” Lone told Catch. “A predominant number of them are not covered under any affirmative action scheme”.",2018-02-13,, J&K offers quota to ‘poorest of poor': Why this could change Valley's political landscape | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/j-k-offers-quota-to-poorest-of-poor-why-this-could-change-valley-s-political-landscape-99112.html
493,Atonu Choudhurri,"The BJP appears to be banking on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister   as a major crowd-puller in Tripura. He has addressed a rally in the state on 11 February and is going to address another on 16 February. “We prefer Yogi Adityanath, who is an uncompromising votary of Hindutva. He has an image as a right-wing populist Hindutva firebrand,” a local RSS functionary said. The people of Tripura have overwhelmingly voted for the Manik Sarkar-led CPI (M) for the two decades. But this time, the scene has drastically changed. There is an unlikely saffron surge in this tiny Northeastern state where Bengalis are in a majority. The state is going to poll on February 18. Tripura has never seen such an intense poll battle in recent years. The elections were reduced to a mere cakewalk for the CPI(M) during the past four elections. And in its desperation to end 'Sarkar Raj', the party is riding on issues of anti-incumbency, corruption and unemployment. The idea is to woo Hindus who account for 92% of total population. Besides, Tripura has an unlikely close connection with Yogi Adityanath. The firebrand leader has become the saffron party's most prominent star campaigner. A BJP leader said the state has a sizeable population of Hindu Bengalis who belong to the Nath community, which is Yogi's own sect. The BJP is planning to woo Bengali Naths in the state. “A significant thirty five percent of the Bengalis belong to the Nath sect. They can call the shots and help us win many seats,” he said. Eleven names figured on the BJP’s star campaigners' list in this Northeastern state— Prime Minister  , Yogi Adityanath, party president  , Union ministers  , Smriti Irani,  , Nirmala Sitharaman, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal, minister Jual Oram and MP Rupa Ganguly. A CPI(M) leader, however, said, “People of Tripura have never welcomed the BJP that is often seen as a party from 'Hindi heartland,' with no root in the Northeastern state,” he said. To substantiate his claim, he said, “Even PM Narendra Modi, who had addressed 437 rallies and traveled 3,000 km across 25 states during poll campaign in 2014, could not find takers here. The city's Astabal ground, with a capacity of 40,000, saw a gathering of less than 7,000 people during Modi's rally in 2014,” But times have changed since then, said Biplab Deb, president of BJP's Tripura unit. “BJP wants to erase the tag that it is a party from Hindi heartland. We preach the ideology of Bharatiyata. Indigenous tribals and Bengalis are Indians by heart. Same thread is binding us. CPM rule is mired in corruption and violence. We'll storm to power in this election,” Deb told Catch. The saffron party has unleashed a lavish campaign in Tripura in its desperation to seize power in the state. State BJP leaders feel that Yogi's high octane speeches peppered with Hindutva themes are set to find takers. The mention of Yogi's name evoked anger from the rival party. “The BJP is at it again. Bringing Yogi for the poll campaign can polarise people,” said Partha Karmakar, a CPI(ML) leader. Deb, however, brushed aside such claims, saying there's hardly any basis in such comments. “It is not proper to call Yogi a polarising figure. He visited the Taj and spoke for its upgradation. Is this not enough?” “He wears saffron robes and continues to be the mahant of the Gorakhnath temple. But he is also the chief minister and has his eyes and ears open and sees issues from the perspective of an administrator,” Deb added.",2018-02-14,," Tripura polls: BJP unleashes Yogi Adityanath, hoping to woo Nath sect voters | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/tripura-polls-bjp-unleashes-yogi-adityanath-hoping-to-woo-nath-sect-voters-99265.html
494,Akash Bisht,"The by-elections in Madya Pradesh were necessitated due to the demise of sitting Congress MLAs – Mahendra Singh Kalukheda and Ram Singh Yadav – who represented Mungaoli and Kolaras Assembly seats. Interestingly, both these segments fall in Congress' Jyotiraditya Scindia's Guna Lok Sabha constituency giving much hope to the Grand Old Party. Widely considered to be a semi-final battle before the Assembly polls, both Congress and BJP are leaving no stone unturned to ensure their victory in these seats which could come as a huge morale booster before the final contest. While Congress, which for a longest period of time has been equated to a divided house, is trying to present a united face which reflects in its spirited campaign, BJP's chief minister   is literally camping in these two seats to ensure a big blow to the Congress. Chouhan has even gone to the extent of promising to work as an MLA in these two seats for the next six months if BJP manages to snatch these seats out of Congress' hold. If BJP manages a win here, this will help the chief minister reassert his popularity and silence his critics who have been demanding a change of face in Madhya Pradesh before the assembly polls. Meanwhile, Congress is hopeful of winning these seats considering Scindia had been an MP from Guna since 2002. However, BJP leaders have gone to claim how these seats have oscillated between the two parties with the saffron party winning the seat four times and Congress three since 1985. A Yadav-dominated seat, both the parties have fielded Yadav candidates for Mungaoli which will witness BJP's Baisaab Yadav, widow of former BJP MLA, take on Congress' Brijesh Singh Yadav. In Kolaras, the BJP has fielded former MLA Devndra Jain against Congress' Mahendra Singh Yadav who is hoping to ride on a sympathy wave considering he is the son of former MLA Ram Singh Yadav whose death necessitated the polls. These elections are being seen as a direct contest between Chouhan and Scindia and a loss here for any of them could come as a big blow to their party's aspirations to rule the state. It could be a bigger blow to Scindia who is hoping to named as the Congress’ chief ministerialcandidate. In Odisha, the contest is even more intriguing considering how Congress' influence in the state has been on the wane with BJP making significant inroads in the coastal state considered to be a BJD bastion. The by-elections in Bijepur were necessitated after the demise of Congress MLA Subal Sahu in August last year. Congress would be hoping to regain the seat which at present looks a difficult proposition considering how BJP has gone all guns blazing with party president   along with several Union ministers and leaders campaigning for their party's candidate. With Assembly elections only a year away, BJD too has launched an aggressive campaign in Bijepur with the intent to deflate BJP's ambitious mission of winning more than 120 seats in the 147 member assembly. The elections in Bijepur could very well foretell what lies ahead for the state in 2019 and whether the BJP could outsmart the wily Odisha chief minister Navin Patnaik who has been ruling the state for the last 18 years. Interestingly, while both BJD and BJP are sweating it out in Bijepur, Congress has become completely sidelined despite having won the seat in 2014. The by-election is also a testimony of the political transformation in Odisha wherein the Congress seems to have conceded the opposition space to BJP without much fight. Even if BJP loses this seat and comes second, it will claim a moral victory over Congress and look forward to take on the BJD in 2019. Meanwhile, the second round of by-elections are most intriguing wherein BJP will try to assert its position -- UP and Bihar. All of five seats will witness a bypoll in the two states on 11 March which include two Lok Sabha seats – Gorakhpur and Phulpur – in UP and Araria Lok Sabha seat in Bihar. By-elections in two Assembly segments of Bihar – Bhabua and the Jehanabad – will also be held simultaneously. The two seats in UP fell vacant after   and Keshav Prasad Maurya became chief minister and deputy chief minister respectively. Though the BJP is not leaving anything to chance, it faces a stern test from Opposition parties that are planning to field a joint candidate to ensure the ruling party's rout. The Congress and SP are trying to field a common candidate though nothing has materialised as if now. An SP leader informed that all the parties in the fray are still deliberating over the candidates and they are hopeful of reaching a consensus. Sources have informed that the Opposition parties are keen on fielding Union minister Anupriya Patel's estranged mother Krishna Patel from Phulpur on SP ticket. Wife of late Sone Lal Patel, who founded the Apna Dal, Krishna Patel has considerable following among Kurmis and both the parties are hoping that it would be enough to swing the mandate in her favour. However, Krishna Patel is keen on contesting on Apna Dal ticket with support from Congress and SP. At the time of filing this report, negotiations were still being held and the decision could be announced on Tuesday. Widely considered to be an SP bastion, Maurya turned the tide after he defeated SP candidate from Phulpur in 2014 with a margin of over three lakh votes. Meanwhile, both the Opposition and the BJP have maintained complete silence on who would contest elections from Gorakhpur. The last date of filing nominations in 20 February and the names could be revealed in the next few days. BJP would be hoping to continue its golden run in UP where it won 325 of the 403 assembly seats in 2017 and 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. A close contest is also on the cards in the by polls to be held in Araria Lok Sabha seat Bhabua and the Jehanabad Assembly constituencies. These three seats fell vacant after the death sitting representatives for which polls would be held on 11 March. BJP had won the Bhabua seat in 2015 while RJD leader Mundrika Singh Yadav won from Jehanabad. The Araira seat fell vacant after RJD leader Mohammad Taslimuddin passed away. Interestingly, JD(U) has announced that it will not contest any of the three seats that fell vacant paving way for BJP to contest elections on these seats. Further, soon after the party made the announcement, its sitting MLA from Jokihat, Sarfaraz Alam, who is also the son of Taslimuddin, quit JD(U) and joined RJD. This is a major boost for the RJD which feels that Alam is a strong candidate and could very well win the elections riding on the sympathy wave. Overall, the upcoming elections will witness a direct contest between the BJP and RJD. Out of three seats, BJP had won the Bhabua assembly seat while the other two were with the RJD. With Alam joining RJD, there are strong chances of the party winning all three seats which serve as shot in the arm for the beleaguered party that is yet to come to terms with jail to its founder   on charges of corruption. In the prevailing circumstances, this battle between the BJP and RJD could also set the tone for the General Elections in 2019. BJP in all probability will try to corner the RJD by bringing the corruption cases against its patron and if RJD still manages to snatch a victory, it will give the party huge boost as it approaches the next big test.A string of by-elections for Lok Sabha and Assembly seats to be held in February and March will yet again test whether the BJP has been able to sustain its popularity under the leadership of Prime Minister  . Defeats in the recently held Lok Sabha by-elections in Rajasthan and a close contest in Gujarat have exposed chinks in BJP's armour and it remains to be seen whether the saffron party is able to use the forthcoming bypolls in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh recover its winning streak.   On  , elections would be held for two Assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh and one seat in Odisha while the results would be announced four days later on 28 February. The elections in these states remain crucial for the BJP since it is looking to return to power in Madhya Pradesh where elections are to be held later this year. Meanwhile, in Odisha, it is an acid test for the saffron party looking to end BJD's 18-year-rule in the state.February 24",2018-02-13,, Bypoll battle: 3 LS & 5 Assembly seats up for grabs.

495,Akash Bisht,"A day after state-owned Punjab National Bank informed the Bombay Stock Exchange of detecting fraudulent transactions worth over Rs 11,000 crore in its Mumbai branch related to businessman Nirav Modi, the Congress hit out at the   government. The Grand Old Party claimed that the matter was brought to the notice of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on July 2016 and yet the Prime Minister and Finance Minister took no action. “A complaint was filed to the PMO about the entire fraud being perpetuated as early as on 26 July, 2016. Yet, no action was taken either by the PMO or any other authority. Bank lost the money and the accused escaped,” said Congress' chief spokesperson RS Surjewala. On 26 July, one Hari Prasad from Bengaluru wrote to the PMO accusing Mehul C Choksi-promoted Gitanjali Gems, Gili India and Nakshatra of indulging in a scam and fraud in Mumbai, wherein thousands of crores of public money is being siphoned off systematically. Choksi also happens to be Nirav Modi's maternal uncle and business partner. According to reports, both Choksi and Nirav Modi have left India. Reacting to reports of Nirav Modi leaving India, Congress said that “loot and escape” have become the hallmark of the Modi government. Addressing Nirav Modi as 'Chhota (Small) Modi', Surjewala raised suspicion over whether the jeweller-businessman was tipped off by someone within the government just like Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya. Meanwhile, Prasad in his letter to the PMO also mentioned how despite complaints by various franchisee victims no action was taken against the the company by investigating agencies. “Having failed to get the attention of any serious investigating authority, we have finally come to your door for justice,” read the letter.  Further in his letter, he wrote how Choksi has siphoned off thousands of crores outside of India and furnished evidence of his claims. He went on to write how there are lots of deficiencies in the balance sheets and furnished a list of 31 banks extending loans to Choksi's group.  “This company has taken huge loans to the tune of “almost Rs 9,872 crore with meager assets of just Rs 25-30 crore”. He warned that these loans can soon become NPA and “someone needs to investigate the credit report of this group with these banks”. He also warned that the chances of Choksi defaulting on payments are high considering his company has not been paying income-tax running into thousands of crores since 2006. “I hope you will take due note of the above and do your bit to save the country from another Subroto Roy (Sahara Group) and Vijay Mallya (King Fisher group) and many such kind of white collar THUGS from looting public money and stashing it out of India,” read the letter.  On 29 July, 2016, Prasad wrote to Mumbai's Registrar of Companies wherein he forwarded the same letter and yet no action was taken. Reacting to this, Surjewala said, “Why did Prime Minister not take any action to protect the interests of the banking sector despite a written complaint having been received and acknowledged on 26 July, 2016? Why were all the authorities, including Finance Ministry, its financial intelligence units and all other authorities sleeping on their job?” Surjewala further stated how the complaint by PNB to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) dated 29 January, 2018 reflects as to how from 9 January to 14 February 2017, eight Letters of Understandings worth crores of rupees were issued.  Surjewala said, “What the Modi government has not told us is that there is also an exposure of Rs 9,872 crore of various banks with Gitanjali Gems Ltd, a company promoted by Shri Mehul Choksi. The entire system was bypassed.  “All regulatory mechanisms broke down. Everything escaped the eyes of auditors and investigators. Risk Management and Fraud Detection ability came to a naught. Yet, the Modi government would have believe us that this entire fraud was being perpetrated by two employees.”  The Congress also raised questions over what “chota Modi (Nirav Modi)"" was doing with the PM at Davos earlier this year. Surjewala claimed that despite being made aware of such a fraud, Nirav Modi was part of a delegation of Indian businessmen at Davos. In one such photograph, which has gone viral, Nirav Modi can be seen in a group photograph along with bureaucrats and CEOs posing with the Prime Minister on 23 January in Davos. Congress President   too did not leave the opportunity to corner the PM over Nirav Modi and tweeted, “Guide to looting India by Nirav Modi – 1. Hug PM Modi 2. Be seen with him in DAVOS. Use that clout to: A. Steal 12,000 crore B. Slip out of the country like Mallya, while the government looks the other way.”",2018-02-15,, 'If you had information why didn't you act' Cong asks NaMo a day after Nirav expose  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/if-you-had-information-why-didn-t-you-act-cong-asks-namo-a-day-after-nirav-expose-99402.html

Former IPS officer Bharati Ghosh has come under the scanner of the Criminal Investigation Department of the West Bengal Police in connection with a complaint of extortion and misappropriation of funds. On Tuesday CID conducted raids on Ghosh’s flats and is said to have recovered valuable items worth a few lakhs. Dilip Ghosh state BJP president said “Our party is ready to induct Ghosh if she is willing to join. Trinamool Congress is unnecessarily trying to bring false charges against her as she is aware of some misdeeds of a few TMC ministers. TMC has initiated the CID enquiry to silence her voice.”   According to Ghosh , BJP will use the same tactics as Trinamool Congress to come to power in Bengal. The party is willing to induct those officers and ministers or MLAs who have been on the wrong side of the ruling party.   It must be recalled that the Trinamool Congress had similarly wooed a number of IPS and IAS officers who had fallen out with the erstwhile Left Front. When contacted Ghosh said,  “I have not got any offer from BJP to join their party. No one has approached me. I cannot comment anything on this matter.” Senior BJP leaders said that the main motive of BJP is to point out the weaknesses in the Trinamool administration and upset state government officials can prove useful in this respect. According to state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee, “It’s clear that BJP is trying to induct leaders and officers with criminal background.” CPI(M) Sujan Chakraborty said, “Trinamool Congress and BJP are two side of same coin.

498,Rajeev Khanna,"The 'hunkar' (thunder) was definitely missing from the  's (BJP) Yuva Hunkar Rally in Jind Thursday despite an address by party chief  . The response that it got from the masses as well as the Opposition is an indication that the BJP is definitely on the defensive in the state as far as the forthcoming Lok Sabha and subsequent Assembly polls are concerned.  This is also evident from the fact that with not much to write home about the performance of the Manohar Lal Khattar government in the state, the party's much-touted poll campaign by Shah began on a negative note. Most of the time was spent blaming the Congress instead of recounting the BJP's achievements. In the process the BJP sent out negative signals with commoners pointing out that such events are normally planned by the Opposition; the ruling party should foclus on addressing the concerns of the people than such antics where the chief minister and the party president are promoted riding motorcycles. Shah harped on the BJP's promise of a corruption-free, inclusive government. But the people were more keen to hear what the party had to say on the conduct of the central government over the flight of scam accused likes of Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallaya. By Thursday evening videos of empty chairs at the rally went viral; anyway, allegations regarding the mining scam in Dadam area of Bhiwani and other areas that have hit headlines at regular intervals. Shah chose to focus his attack on the Congress, particularly on the former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The BJP chief said during his regime central funds for Haryana “used to go down the gutter of corruption”. “Listen Hooda ji, I have come here with all accounts to be put before the people,” he said as he tried to compare the corruption during the Congress regime with the “development and corruption-free government” under his party's regime. The BJP has been claiming that the rally would create a world record but the empty chairs at the venue proved to be a counter to the claims. “There is not a single allegation of corruption against the Khattar government. This is a big achievement,” he said, claiming Khattar initiated a number of pro-people measures. He also claimed that during this regime the state has been free of nepotism, corruption and regionalism. He then focused on what the central government's recent budget has to offer to the masses. Both the Congress and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) have termed the BJP rally a failure. Hooda has asked the BJP to spell the motive behind the rally while the state Congress unit chief Ashok Tanwar alleged that Rs 100 crore was spent on this rally in terms of making security and arrangements. Tanwar was arrested along with his supporters when he had gone to oppose Shah's rally. The Indian National Lokdal (INLD) workers too had protested at various places by showing black flags. The party had opposed the event on the grounds that the BJP government in the state as well as at the Centre has been doing nothing to get Haryana its water dues by expediting the construction of the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal. INLD leaders have also been vocal about their resentment against the BJP's tourism minister in Goa having made adverse comments against Haryanavis. The BJP cannot expect to find buyers to its tall claims given the experience of Khattar administration having unraveled repeatedly, particularly on the law and order front. In the last three years of its existence the government has stood exposed for its inability to check mayhem in the instances of the law catching up with controversial godmen Ram Pal and Ram Rahim.  The state is still to recover from the damage that the mishandling of the Jat reservation agitation did to the social fabric as the community stood isolated from the remaining 35 Biradaris (communities) of the state. The government's record in checking the violence against women has been among the worst in the country with the state recording most heinous rapes at regular intervals and the Punjab and Haryana High Court continuing to shame the state for its inability to bring to book the culprits of the Murthal mass rapes during height of the Jat agitation of 2016.  Then there has also been the menace of cow vigilantes that has alienated the minorities and the Dalits. The Dalits have otherwise also been targeted in the state and have been very vulnerable to the assaults by upper castes. These are subjects which Shah and his leaders would not touch but the people would remember when the time comes for polling.  The BJP's electoral graph at this point of time is looking to dip in Haryana in a big way unless the party comes up with something that can check this slide.",2018-02-16,, Amit Shah's flop rally shows BJP desperately needs to check slide in Haryana | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/amit-shah-s-flop-rally-shows-bjp-desperately-needs-to-check-slide-in-haryana-99553.html

501,Sulagna Sengupta,"With BJP slowly gaining ground in West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee is taking a leaf out of Congress President  ’s book. She is visiting several Hindu temples, which is being seen as an attempt to play the soft Hindutva card. In the last three months, she is said to have visited several major temples. For instance,   she offered prayers at the ISCKON temple in Mayapur in Nadia districts Krishnanagar. Last month, she had gone to the Kankalitala temple at Birbhum and also urged the Birbhum district president of the Trinamool Congress Anubrata Mondal to organise a Brahmin Sammelan. On  , the Brahmin Sammelan was held at Birbhum and a campaign to distribute the Bhagwad Gita held in the Bolpur town in the district. The BJP accused Banerjee of trying to prevent the consolidation of Hindu votes behind it. In April last year, Banerjee had gone to the Jagannath Temple in Puri during her visit to Odisha to meet Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. She was not allowed to enter the temple premise by a faction of temple officials who accused her of offending Hindus by allowing the consumption of cow meat and buffalo meat in her state. She was later allowed entry after Patnaik intervened.   Trinamool Congress minister Rajib Banerjee had also organised a Brahmin sammelan at Dakhineswar in December on the instructions of chief minister. Around 120 priests attended the event, where the Bhagwad Gita was also distributed. Meanwhile, the Hindutva outfit Hindu Sanhati has intensified its efforts.  , the outfit openly converted a Muslim family from Assam into Hinduism. A journalist who asked a question was attacked during the function. The founder of Hindu Samhati Tapan Ghosh was detained by the police.   Prasoon Maitra , advisor of Hindu Samhati said , ""Last year too Hindu Sanhati observed the annual foundation day but the process of conversion from Muslims to Hindus was not being done openly. It was done privately. This year we have decided to openly perform the conversion process by taking the consent of all the family members."" Banerjee has ordered strict action against those who assaulted the journalists. Political analysts are of the opinion that Banerjee is trying to counter the BJP’s charge that she is appeasing Muslims. Political analyst Amol Mukherjee, former principal of Presidency College, said “Mamata is leaving no stone unturned to stop the BJP’s rise in Bengal. That’s why she offered prayers at many temples in order to consolidate Hindu votes. At the same time, she says that she does not discriminate between communities and that she believes ‘unity in diversity’. She tries to portray that she is there for both Hindus and Muslims.”",2018-02-16,," After Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee goes on a temple spree to counter BJP in Bengal | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/after-rahul-gandhi-mamata-banerjee-goes-on-a-temple-spree-to-counter-bjp-in-bengal-99557.html
502,Akash Bisht,"On the issue of BJP taking offence to Nirav Modi being referred to as “Chota Modi” by Congress, Surjewala said, “Why are only Modis running away after looting country's wealth? On one hand there is Lalit Modi and on the other Nirav Modi. We spoke only of chota Modi and not bada Modi,” he said.   Responding to the allegations made by the Congress, Union minister   yet again asserted that the scam started in 2011 and credited his government for bringing it to light. He said, “All the NPAs, the wrongful distribution of loans, amongst others were all passed down to us by the UPA government. This is a scam by the bank and not the government.”After having revealed that the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in 2016 was made aware of the fraudulent practices of Mehul Choksi – business partner and maternal uncle of Nirav Modi – the party furnished new documents which clearly suggest that a similar complaint against Choksi was sent to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) way back in 2015. The party claimed that the PMO, Enforcement Directorate (ED), Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), SEBI and two BJP state governments – Gujarat and Maharashtra – were aware of the ongoing scam based on a series of complaints filed as early as on 7 May 2015. These documents revealed that a complaint dated 7 May 2015 was filed to Ministry of Corporate Affairs by one Vaibhav Khuraniya and RM Green Solution Private Limited. The copy of this was also sent to PMO, ED and SFIO. Further, the party revealed that copy of the reply dated 26 May was received by the PMO. Also, a similar complaint was filed with the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mumbai which was received by the same. In addition, the Congress also furnished details of an FIR filed in Ahmedabad Economic Offences Wing against Choksi and others for defrauding him. In fact, the matter went to Gujarat High Court wherein the Gujarat government was one of the parties. In a Special Criminal Application No. 4758 of 2015, Digvijaysinh Jadeja filed an affidavit on 20 July 2016 specifically pointing that Choksi owned a debt of Rs 9,872 crore to banks. In his affidavit, Jadeja wrote, “I would like to draw kind attention of this Hon'ble Court to the fact that the petitioner has a huge debt of Rs 9,872 crores outstanding which is also specified in the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs... And there are full chances of the petitioner running away like Vijay Malia, as his wife is having an apartment in Burj Khalifa Dubai and as a result many litigations pending against him can get frustrated. (sic)” Earlier on Thursday, Congress raised questions over Prime Minister  's familiarity with Nirav considering the latter was seen posing in a group photograph of a business delegation at Davos earlier this year. “Nirav Modi was also part of a business delegation to Davos in the year 2016 too, when Finance Minister, Shri  , had represented India,” claimed Congress. On Friday, the main opposition party levelled another allegation at the Prime Minister claiming he knew to Choksi and had publicly acknowledged him as “our Mehul brother” at an event on Gold Monetization Scheme. The party even released a video to support its claim. https://twitter.com/INCIndiaLive/status/964453707478945795 Meanwhile, addressing media, Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala alleged that the “Bank Loot Scam” has peaked to Rs 21,306 crore and that the total figure can go up to Rs 30,000 crore if all layers of conspiracy get unearthed by the hour. “Punjab National Bank has already admitted exposure of Rs. 11,400 crore in the 293 ‘Letters of Understanding’ (LoUs). In addition, exposure of 30 Banks in loans extended to four companies i.e. ‘Firestar International Private Limited’, ‘Firestar Diamond Fze’, ‘Gitanjali Gems Limited’ and ‘Gitanjali Exports Corporation’ is Rs. 9,906 crore. Thus, total exposure comes to Rs. 21,306 crore i.e. Rs. 11,400 crore + Rs.9,906 crore,” Surjewala claimed. He went on to add that since the PNB stock has depreciated eroding Rs.7,000 crore in value. “If you add the erosion of value of 7,000 crores, total exposure comes to Rs.28,306 crore. In addition, exposure of Banks to three more companies i.e. Diamonds RUS, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds, is yet to be disclosed by the Banks and Modi Government. Experts estimate this exposure to be in the range of Rs.3,000/Rs.5000 crore. This will further enhance the total figure of the scam,” he mentioned. Congress released a list of five questions wherein it sought details of whether the scam has peaked to Rs 21,306 crore. “What is the total loss to the banks? Why is government mum?” asked Congress. Earlier in the day, Congress President   tweeted a formula which seems to show Prime Minister as a catalyst in letting Nirav and Lalit Modi escape India. https://twitter.com/OfficeOfRG/status/964422238089887744 Taking it forward, Surjewala mentioned that “Udaan” is the buzzword of the government wherein “every scamster can fleece and fly undetected and unchecked”. He went on to allege that there is someone in the government who is helping such scamsters flee the nation. The main opposition party also raised doubts over how a fraud of this proportion missed everyone's attention despite banks conducting four stage audit system – statutory, internal, concurrent and RBI inspection. The party alleged that someone was indeed protecting this network of fraud. Meanwhile, the war of words between the BJP and Congress continued from where it was left on Thursday wherein Union minister   claimed that the bank scam happened during the tenure of previous UPA government. Responding to it, Congress' official handle tweeted: “Mr Ravi Shankar Prasad should've done a little bit of homework on the Nirav Modi - Mehul Choksi Scam. The CBI FIR clearly shows LoUs were issued in Feb 2017.

503,Ashwin Aghor,"Under fire from BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa for allegedly “eating non-vegetarian food” before going to a temple, Congress President   and Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah have found support from an unlikely quarter: the  . In the party mouthpiece  , Shiv Sena supremo   has written, “Since Rahul Gandhi is giving sleepless nights to BJP leaders in Karnataka, they have stooped down to such a level and are indulging in cheap politics. Yeddyurappa alleged that Rahul Gandhi consumed non-vegetarian food before going to the temple. Congress promptly denied it and even produced proof that Gandhi had, in-fact, eaten pure vegetarian food. The jibes taken at Rahul Gandhi and Siddaramaiah prove that BJP leaders have lost their mental balance. What Rahul had on his plate is a secondary issue. The main issue is that BJP is rattled to the core in the state”. The editorial further reminds BJP how Rahul Gandhi had given it a tough fight in Gujarat and predicts that the same might be repeated in Karnataka    “When he visited temples in Gujarat and participated in poojas at different places, BJP resorted to sharp criticism. This is only out of the fear that if Congress also takes a Hindutva line, the BJP will not be left with any issue to campaign on”. “The soft Hindutva adopted by Congress in Gujarat and its outcome has left the BJP leaders worried. They are afraid that Karnataka will be a repeat of Gujarat. BJP leaders are frustrated by the growing support to Rahul Gandhi in Karnataka. Like in Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi is visiting every possible mosque and temple in Karnataka. And this has left BJP leaders fuming as Congress is systematically cornering the BJP just like it did in Gujarat. Former Chief Minister and face of BJP in this election BS Yeddyurappa has only exposed how helpless BJP is,” the editorial says. Slamming Yeddyurappa, the editorial says that “no one should poke one’s nose into what the other person is eating”. “People sacrifice animals to some deities in Maharashtra too. It is tradition at many places. Such customs and traditions should be kept limited to religious programmes. Invoking them in politics for short term gains is not good politics. We don’t know whether Indira Gandhi was vegetarian or non-vegetarian. But the fact is that she was strong enough to break Pakistan into two pieces. We should be more concerned about political performance of a leader rather than his eating habits,” the editorial says. However, it is not known if the Shiv Sena’s remarks will help or harm the Congress’ prospects in Karnataka. After all, the party is known for its tough stand on the border dispute between Maharashtra and Karnataka. It is the Sena’s long pending demand that Belagavi be included in Maharashtra as the majority of the people there speak Marathi. The editorial must be viewed in context of the Shiv Sena’s deteriorating ties with the BJP and the manner in which Thackeray spares no opportunity in attack the party. The BJP, however, has slammed the editorial. BJP spokesperson Madhu Chavan said, “The editorials are not even worth acknowledging, leave alone commenting on. Shiv Sena has only one point agenda - to spew venom against BJP at every opportunity.” A senior BJP leader who did not wish to be named said, “Shiv Sena has come to such a pass that it has realised the blunder it has committed by snapping ties with BJP. Despite claiming to be the saviour of Marathi people, it has never been able to win Mumbai civic polls on its own. It has no presence beyond Mumbai, Pune and Nashik.

504,Sadiq Naqvi  ,"The   (BJP) will not have to face a united Opposition in the important forthcoming by-elections in Goraphpur and Phoolpur Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, sources said. The seats fell vacant as their representatives Chief Minister Adityanath (from Gorakhpur) and his deputy Keshav Maurya (Phoolpur) had to give them up to join the state legislature. The BJP swept last year's UP Assembly polls while others, notably the Congress, the   (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party, faced a serious drubbing. For the bypolls though the saffron party is yet to announce its candidates. The SP is likely to field Santosh Nishad from Gorakhpur. His father Sanjay Nishad heads the Nishad Party, which has a sizeable following among the Nishad community whose members have tradionally been boatsmen. Gorakhpur is said to have a sizeable number of Nishads.  But that's not the only reason behind chosing Santosh. According to a source close to SP chief  , the party is trying to build the foundation for the Lok Sabha polls.  “Getting an important Nishad leader on board will help in 2019,” an SP leader said.  Fielding Santosh from Gorakhpur can also ensure the support of other smaller outfits like the Peace Party, which has a following among the backward class Pasmanda Muslims. This could pose a challenge for the BJP and Adityanath. The five-time parliamentarian from Gorakhpur also heads the important Gorakhnath Math there. In Phoolpur, meanwhile, caste equations may tilt the balance. From this seat once represented by Jawaharlal Nehru, the SP is likely to field Nagendra Patel, a local party leader. The constituency has a sizeable population of Kurmis, to which Patel belongs. There were talks of Krishna Patel, the wife of Sonelal Patel and estranged mother of Union Minister Anupriya Patel, contesting as the Opposition candidate. But she wasn't ready to contest on the SP symbol, according to an SP leader.  “We could not afford to not have a candidate contest on our symbol in the bypolls,” the leader said. He also highlighted how talks were initiated about two months ago, but they fell through after reservations on contesting on the party symbol.  “We can give them one or two seats in the 2019 elections. But ceding space in the bypolls is out of question,” the leader said. “Not contesting the by-polls on its own symbol will hurt the morale of the party workers,” he added. Senior SP leader and state unit chief Naresh Uttam Patel’s name also did the rounds, but the party is likely to chose a local. Naresh Uttam comes from neighbouring Fatehpur. The SP hopes to capitalise on the Kurmi votebank by fielding a Patel and is banking on the fact that other communities that voted it in the past would not desert it.  “We are also hopeful that since Indrajeet Saroj joined the party after leaving the  , we should be able to get some Dalit votes as well. And together with the Kurmi, other backward and the minority votebank, we should be comfortable,” an SP leader said. Saroj, who left the BSP last August, is said to have a following among the Pasi community. The BSP, as has been its history, is yet again not contesting the by-polls. Meanwhile, the SP leader said the party has a strong presence in at least five of the six Assembly segments that make up the Phoolpur Lok Sabha constituency. “We are not that strong in Allahabad North,” an SP leader said. The SP won Phulpur from 1996 to 2004, but lost in 2009 and 2014. Maurya won the last election by a large margin. Late Friday evening the Congress announced the candidature of Surheeta Chatterjee Karim from Gorakhpur and Manish Mishra from Phoolpur. Karim is a local doctor while Mishra is a general secretary in party's state unit.

505,Akash Bisht,"The state unit of the BJP had earlier alleged that the two bandhs were backed by Congress chief minister Siddaramaiah to pressurise the central government to ensure the resolution of the Mahadayi river water sharing dispute. Shah is to hold a rally on 25 January in Mysuru, which coincides with a state-wide bandh, while Modi will arrive in Bengaluru on 4 February – the day of the state capital bandh – for BJP’s Parivartan Yatra valedictory function.   These bandhs have put the BJP under tremendous pressure, since either of the two leaders skipping their respective rallies will send the wrong signal to BJP supporters in the state. What makes Modi’s visit crucial is that, with this rally, he will kick start the party’s election campaign in the state. Hoping to end Congress’ rule in the state, BJP is banking on Modi and Shah to boost its prospects in the state where the Grand Old Party too is on a strong wicket.   Though Siddaramaiah has claimed that he does not support any such bandh, members of his party have openly supported the farmers’ organisations on this issue.   The two bandhs have been called by Vatal Nagaraj, President of the Confederation of Pro-Kannada Organisations, who claims that the twin bandhs are being organised in support of farmers who for decades have been demanding a resolution of the Mahadayi water dispute.   The protesters, who have organised similar bandhs in the past, have been demanding the Prime Minister’s intervention in the matter, considering the dispute between Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra has gone on for the past three decades. With no resolution of the crisis in sight, the farmers from Karnataka’s drought prone districts, particularly Gadag, Dharwad, Belagavi, Haveri, and Bagalkot have raised the banner of revolt against the central government to end the crisis.   Meanwhile, differences have begun to surface amongst the protesting groups, with a section claiming that it is becoming pointless to have these bandhs. They cite previous instances of similar bandhs leading to no breakthrough in the existing crisis. They are also of the opinion that such bandhs cause inconvenience to the common man, with none of the political parties willing to resolve the Mahadayi water sharing crisis. The Mahadayi River originates in Karnataka before entering Goa and Maharashtra, and the three states have been locked in a bitter battle for the last three decades. It was only in 1985 that the central government intervened to resolve the crisis. However, in 2002, the water sharing issue turned into a full-blown crisis when then Chief Minister of Karnataka SM Krishna built canals over the two tributaries of Mahadayi – Kalasa and Banduri.   The aim was to divert water from Mahadayi to Malaprabha river to meet the drinking water demands of some of the drought prone districts of the state. However, the move was opposed by then Goa Chief Minister  , who claimed that the proposal could be ecologically disastrous for the Western Ghats of the coastal state. Since the NDA government was in power at the Centre, Parrikar’s arguments were given precedence and the project was stalled.   Earlier in December, Parrikar met with Shah and BS Yeddyurappa and had renewed discussions on the issue, later even sending a letter to Yeddyurappa assuring him that the Goa government would not oppose the water sharing agreement. This led to widespread criticism from the opposition, after which Parrikar denied reports of him meeting Siddaramaiah to resolve the crisis.   This has led to a pitched political battle in the state, with the Congress accusing the BJP of not doing enough to ensure water for those living in these drought prone regions. Karnataka has been demanding 7.56 thousand million cubic feet of water to ensure regular water supply to  the parched districts of Belagavi and Gadag. Those protesting have reiterated that BJP, which is in power at both the Centre and in Goa, should resolve the crisis. However, they acknowledge that the issue is also being used by Congress to settle political scores in the run up to the polls. It is for this reason that Yeddyurappa is trying to convince protestors to end their agitation, an attempt that has seemingly failed. Karnataka goes to polls in April-  to elect 224 legislators, a battle which will see the Congress and BJP face off for control of the southern state.As the date for assembly elections in Karnataka draws closer, both the Congress and   (BJP) are using state-wide bandhs to settle political scores in the poll-bound state. After Congress extended support to twin bandhs proposed by pro-Kannada groups and farmer organisations on dates that coincide with Prime Minister   and BJP president  ’s rallies in the state, the saffron party has called for a counter bandh between 10-12 February, when Congress president   will be visiting the state.",2018-01-24,"Bharatiya Janata Party,Indian National Congress,Narendra Modi,Siddaramaiah,Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah,Karnataka  Assembly Election,Karnataka Assembly Election 2018,karnataka bandh", Karnataka bandhs put BJP in uncomfortable position as Congress leverages Mahadayi issue | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/karnataka-bandhs-put-bjp-in-uncomfortable-position-as-congress-leverages-mahadayi-issue-96456.html
506,Charu Kartikeya,"The slogan has become a cliché now. Every time the   government is questioned about its poor record in upholding minority rights, its ministers and babus immediately sit up in their sofas, suck some air in, look straight and announce with military discipline - “sabka saath, sabka vikaas!” Rajiv K Chander, India's Permanent Representative to the UN, did that in Geneva last September, when the UN's human rights body pulled up India for religious  .  , senior member of Modi's Cabinet, did the same at Davos on 24 January. Prabhu was asked by a journalist to respond to the criticism that the BJP has  Indian Muslims. Pat came the  . The contrast was stark. The journalist had taken over a minute to frame the question in the most polite manner possible and hesitated a lot before finally coming up with the right words. Prabhu wasted no time in pondering or framing the right response, almost as if he had been trained to respond promptly in such situations. “This is the first government that doesn't discriminate the population on the basis of religion”, Prabhu said. A bit of elaboration followed and the minister concluded by flashing the cliched card, “Sabka saath, sabka vikaas”. When this slogan was first introduced by the BJP in the campaign for the Lok Sabha polls 2014, it first gave the impression of a reach-out to all sections of the population, including Muslims. However, four years of the Modi government's tenure have conclusively proved that the slogan actually translates into removal of the umbrella of special protection that covered minorities so far in India and all responsible democracies. “Our government believes all citizens of India enjoy equal rights, equal privileges and they shouldn't be discriminate based on religion...faith,” Prabhu said. “Rain falls on all houses equally. Similar should be role of government...policies and schemes should be for everyone,” he continued. In a testimony to how proudly this government wears its saffron badge, Prabhu confidently introduced Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister   into the conversation. He said the UP CM wears saffron clothes but is going out of his way to find out how government schemes will reach out to all sections of society, including Muslims”. You would think referring to Adityanath doesn't sound like the best response when the BJP's commitment to minority rights is being questioned. After all, this is the same Adityanath who is known as a hardline supporter of the Hindutva agenda. He has publicly supported the 'ghar-wapsi' programme of forced conversions of Muslims to Hinduism and has openly incited violence against  . He runs an outfit of goons called the Hindu Yuva Vahini, which specialises in physical violence against Muslims and in calling for raping dead Muslim  . But all of those are cherished entries in his resume, in the BJP's scheme of things, making him worthy of being mentioned at a global summit. Prabhu also mentioned the Bill outlawing triple talaq, arguing “Why would we bring Triple Talaq Bill in Parliament if we discriminate against Muslims?” The BJP has been successfully using that campaign to send out a message to its core constituency that the project to “discipline” the Muslim community has  . It would have been better if the journalist at Davos would have asked Prabhu what did that actually mean - that this was the first government that didn't discriminate between people on the basis of religion? Which government does he hold guilty of doing that? All previous governments? Does Prabhu think protecting and promoting the interests of religious minorities is discrimination? Nevertheless, a senior minister being thrown the minorities-question at a global summit is an embarrassment for the government. It may also be a warning sign that from here on, more questions and international scrutiny will follow. With the next Lok Sabha polls looming just over the horizon, Modi-government will do well to heed to this signal and improve its track record from here on. But it is unlikely to do that. As the journalist pointed out in his question to Prabhu, it is precisely for electoral benefits that the BJP is marginalising Muslims.",2018-02-22,, Suresh Prabhu’s comments at Davos show BJP is proud of marginalising minorities | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/suresh-prabhu-s-comments-at-davos-show-bjp-is-proud-of-marginalising-minorities-96659.html
507,Riyaz Wani,"But how does one recruit women, when joining the BJP in the Valley entails a degree of risk, more so, in militancy-affected South where a BJP worker was recently killed? ""We don't actively and visibly seek membership of women. We do small works of the women, address their issues, and then they happily join us. In some places, more than a hundred women have joined us at one time,"" Gash explains. However, North Kashmir's Baramulla and South Kashmir's Anantnag districts have seen the highest number of women recruits. But secrecy is the key. ""We ensure that our members are not publicly identified, lest it create any security problems for them,"" Gash said. ""They register themselves online as BJP members. All they have to do is to give a call to a BJP number"". This, however, is not a paid recruitment drive. ""Not at all,” Gash assures, adding, “But being a part of the BJP empowers them. Their grievances and issues are easily addressed,"" she said. “We ensure that the administration takes their issues seriously. I personally visit offices to sort the issues and more often than not it is done on priority.” Gash's own entry into the party was accidental. ""It was just a few weeks before the 2014 Assembly elections that I received a call from a senior BJP leader that I have been selected as a candidate for Srinagar's Zadibal constituency,” Gash recounts. “They gave me a night to decide. I talked to my father, who gave a go-ahead,"" she said. ""I jumped into the fray right away. I held many public meetings in the short time that I had"". But Gash polled just 360 votes. The seat was won by PDP leader Aabid Ansari. Still, Gash takes pride in her belief that she is “the first Shia woman who has contested an election in the past 70 years of the democratic history in India.” Failure in the polls didn’t stop her. Ever since, she has worked hard to build her base in the constituency, and also enlist more women recruits for the BJP across the Valley. She claims to have around 15,000 members in Zadibal constituency alone, including around 2,000 women. Gash, however, acknowledges that it's tough being a BJP leader in the state, more so a woman leader. She still remembers the South Kashmir youth who was killed by militants soon after attending a BJP meeting in Srinagar. He was abducted, and his body was later recovered some distance from his home. His throat had been slit. ""I had met him several times. He was a good worker and had helped mobilize some support for the BJP,"" Gash said. Does this make her apprehensive about her own security? It does. But Gash has sought refuge in fatalism. She believes that the death comes only “at an appointed time,” so she doesn’t worry. For now, she is focused on building a sufficient support base for the BJP among women to give the party a boost in the next Assembly elections in 2020, or even earlier in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “We hope that the BJP opens its score in the Kashmir Valley in the next election,” Gash says. “And we are confident that our efforts will bear fruit”. But her pitch to potential recruits and voters steers clear of the BJP’s contentious ideological position on the state, especially its attempt to fiddle with the special position enjoyed by the state under the constitution. She also skirts the cases of lynchings of Muslims in the country. Her pitch is strictly development. “You can’t blame the BJP for the atrocities on Muslims. No government would want to cause violence in the society and get a bad name for it,” says Gash. “In Kashmir, the BJP is for development. We are not much into ideology”. Does she agree with the BJP’s position on the repeal of Article 35A, which forbids outsiders to settle in Kashmir? “No comment,” she said, before adding cryptically, “I am in favour of what is good for Kashmir. And if Article 35A is good for Kashmir’s development, it should remain. Otherwise, it should go.”She says she is a feminist and won't cover her head to make a statement. She refuses to be a part of the National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), or even the Congress which ""ask their women leaders to hide their hair to play to a stereotype of a Muslim woman.” Meet Neelam Gash, the incharge of the  's (BJP) women’s wing in Kashmir. Ever since she joined the saffron party during the 2014 Assembly elections, Gash has been busy building the BJP's support base among Kashmiri women. She's supported in her endeavours by two prominent colleagues – Hina Bhat and Darakhshan Andrabi. It might seem like an uphill task in the politically and communally polarised region, but they have had a decent measure of success. According to Gash, the BJP has now more than 25,000 women members in the Valley, including in the militancy-ridden districts of South Kashmir. ""In each district we have a district president. Our district women wings have offices adjacent to our district offices,"" Gash said. ""Meetings are held at the offices of our district presidents, where we rally our womenfolk and also solve their issues.""",2018-01-24,, Meet the saffron women trying to spread BJP's message in the Valley | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/meet-the-saffron-women-trying-to-spread-bjp-s-message-in-the-valley-96481.html

510,Akash Bisht,"Panda's suspension was a foregone conclusion and it was only a matter of time before the inevitable happened. Over the past few months, Panda had raised the banner of revolt and often took to social networking sites, particularly Twitter, to embarrass the government. His tirade against his own government in multiple opinion pieces in newspapers further embarrassed the incumbent chief minister who is looking for fifth consecutive term as chief minister. The chief minister had issued warnings to the 54-year-old MP through multiple forums but these fell on deaf ears as a combative Panda continued to take potshots at the government and party leaders. Miffed with his attitude, several party leaders campaigned in the state for Panda's removal accusing him speaking in BJP's tone. Though Panda's removal was long overdue, it is the timing of the announcement that yet again speaks volumes about Patnaik being a master tactician. Facing heat over the suicide of a tribal girl from Koraput district on 10 October, who claimed that she was raped by “four uniformed men” which was refuted by the state government, a wily Patnaik has yet again been successful in diverting attention from the issue. What further made his position in the party untenable was his criticism of Patnaik's favourite bureaucrat V Karthikeyan who is said to be running the show in the state. Not only government, the bureaucrat seems to have an iron grip over the day to day party affairs – a hallmark of Patnaik's model of governance. In the early stages of his career, Patnaik had given similar powers to former bureaucrat Pyarimohan Mohapatra, who too ran the show for the chief minister until the two fell out. Mohapatra was accused of plotting a coup to dislodge Patnaik and was eventually shown the door which made him politically irrelevant till he succumbed to cancer in 2017. Further, the decision shouldn't have come as a surprise to Panda considering how Patnaik had earlier shunted out some of the senior most leaders of the party without batting an eye lid. In fact, some of these leaders were also the founding members of the BJD and yet it made no difference to the Odisha chief minister. What also made Panda's position in the party untenable was how a host of local leaders, including ministers and legislators, who accused the 54-year-old MP of not holding any discussions with them on issues of development. The latest flashpoint was how Panda went about using his MPLAD funds without even consulting the local leadership. It is for this reason that Naveen appointed two observers – Usha Devi and Pramilla Mallick – to submit a report on Panda's misdeeds. Though the contents to the two reports have not yet been made public, it obvious that they castigated Panda for his conduct. Panda has been at loggerheads with health minister and Mahanga legislator Pratap Jena. Mahanga falls in Panda's Kendrapara Lok Sabha constituency and Jena for long had been accusing the suspended leader of not holding any consultations with the local leadership over development issues. In 2017, Jena accused Panda of ignoring him and not adding his name on the inauguration plaque of a overhead water tank in Mahanga block. Panda denied these allegations but Jena threatened to disrupt the inauguration ceremony. The Kendrapada MP defied Jena, whose supporters vandalised the plaque and hurled eggs at Panda. The state government ordered an inquiry but nothing much came out of it. Interestingly, what irked Patnaik most was how Panda was beginning to sound like a BJP leader rather than a BJD one. In fact, ever since   won a decisive mandate in 2014, Panda had been showering lavish praises on the prime minister. He had even been accompanying Modi on his visits abroad and even wrote several articles dissing his own government. Panda sharpened his attack on his party and government after BJP made significant gains in the Zila Parishad elections. The saffron party achieved a remarkable feat after it increased its tally from 36 in 2012 to 297. Despite the results, BJD remained far ahead of the BJP and the Congress. However, BJP was successful in emerging as the main Opposition party comfortably taking over the position from a beleagured Congress. With this success, BJP has aggressively begun making inroads in the state and Panda was increasingly being seen as the one speaking the saffron party's language. Thereafter, Odisha TV, owned by Panda, also started portraying BJP as BJD's main challenger. This led to Patnaik removing Panda as BJD's parliamentary party spokesperson. All this while, there were strong rumors of BJP attempting to poach senior BJD leaders which was highlighted by party MP Tathagata Sathpathy who sounded an alarm after he accused an MP of trying to create a split in the party. Those following the political developments in Odisha immediately knew that Sathpathy was referring to Panda. In these circumstances, Panda's ouster was a certainty leading to questions whether his ouster will hurt the BJD. However, it is unlikely considering Panda's limited popularity in the state. He is seen as more of a mover and shaker in Delhi's political circle and not so much in his home state. But, BJP will still see him as an asset considering the popularity of OTV in the state which the saffron party would certainly try to use to its advantage in the run up to 2019 General Elections and Assembly polls. The recent developments in the state are certain to test Patnaik's political acumen which has been tested several times in the past. And on all these occasions, Patnaik emerged victorious. It remains to be seen whether the wily chief minister can brave the saffron wave which would make for a thrilling political contest in the forthcoming elections.Biju   (BJD) chief and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik finally cracked the whip on party MP Baijayant Jay Panda and suspended him from the party over “anti-party activities”. Soon after the decision was announced, Panda expressed shock over his suspension and accused Patnaik of not seeing through the conspiracy hatched against him by a senior bureaucrat.",2018-01-25,," Jay Panda had to go, question is why did Naveen Patnaik choose this moment? | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/jay-panda-had-to-go-question-is-why-did-naveen-patnaik-choose-this-moment-96672.html
512,Rajeev Khanna,"Tanwar's letter is also being seen as stepping up the offensive in the ongoing political turf war within the Congress, taking on his rival – former chief minister Bhupender Singh Hooda. The various Congress factions in Haryana are currently involved in a race to outdo each other in terms of establishing a public connect one year ahead of the Lok Sabha and subsequent state assembly polls.  The Congress smells a strong chance of doing well in the state that has seen the Khattar unravel itself as a failure in maintaining law and order year after year. Tanwar got a boost recently when the Congress president   underlined that there is no move to change the state Congress heads, something that the Hooda supporters have been seeking for long.   In his letter, Tanwar called into question the Khattar government's ability to control law and order. “The continuing atrocities on women has put a big question mark on the efficiency of the police and administration in the state. A rape and a murder being reported every hour and ten heart rending assaults on the women in the last 10 says simply show the failure of the government. Even the chief minister's village has not been spared. It appears that the law and order machinery has collapsed, there is no fear of law, criminals are roaming free and there are no whereabouts of the fast track courts,” Tanwar stated.   He has pointed to the inefficiency of the government in curtailing violence over and over again, be it the Jat reservation stir, or the mayhem unleashed by the followers of Ram Rahim Singh in Panchkula in August, last year, or this most recent violence by the Karni Sena. “The police has been unable to act even in instances where there is prior information available of the impending violence. What more can be a bigger failure ?” Tanwar questioned.   His letter states, “The slogan of Khattar government is 'Jagmag Haryana', but it has pushed the state towards darkness. Another slogan is 'Happening Haryana', but the 'mishappenings in Haryana' have put the state to shame across the world. The government has given the slogan of 'Beti Bachao' but the conditions that have been created have forced the people to actually worry for their daughters. Instead of development people are now referring to the government for development of crime.”   Continuing his attack, Tanwar says that the state government had promised a series of initiatives for the safety of women like installing closed circuit television cameras outside schools and colleges, increased patrolling by women police, and giving self-defense training to girls, but none of these are visible on the grounds.  He even used the occasion to attack Prime Minister  , pointing out that the prime minister, who is known for responding to every small little thing, has not opened his mouth on the issue of women safety in Haryana. The letter also makes a passing reference to the increasing plight of the farmers, growing unemployment among the youth, insecurity among the masses and the thriving health mafia.   He has posed the question before the people, asking, “In the prevailing times of chaos I want to ask the people whether this government has the right to be in office even for a minute.”   He has further stated, “If the chief minister has some pain for the women, the brotherhood among the '36 Biradri' (36 communities residing in the state) and he has some humanity and morality left in him, he should step down in the interest of the state and its people.”   He has promised to fight for the people and throw out the Khattar government in the next assembly polls, which will be held a few months after the Lok Sabha elections next year. Meanwhile, the women's cell of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), under Dabwali MLA Naina Chautala and president Sheela Bhyan, too gave a memorandum to state Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki, seeking dismissal of the Khattar-led BJP government.   The memorandum pointed out that when, in  , the nation experienced the horror of the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder in Delhi, the lawmakers of the country were roused enough to redraft the laws to make punishment for such crimes more stringent. But it appears that Haryana is one state where they have not proved to be a deterrent since Nirbhaya-like rapes and murders are fast becoming a norm.   The memorandum cited statistics which show that, according to the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), 28,369 cases of sexual harassment were registered during 2014 to 2016. In 2016, the number of rape cases rose to 1,189, thereby shamefully putting Haryana at number four in the country. In a new low, last year, 3,641 women went missing and 10,862 complaints of sexual harassment were filed.   Reiterating the accusation of the rising trend in crimes against women, the memorandum pointed out that, according to NCRB statistics, till  , 769 rapes and 98 attempt to rape cases had been recorded. During the current month of 2018, the state has been rocked by a spate of rapes, gang-rapes and brutal murders after the heinous crimes. In a single week, Panipat witnessed the rape and murder of four girls.  In Kurukshetra, a 15-year-old was raped and murdered. Soon thereafter, an 11-year-old Dalit girl of Panipat district was found murdered, raped and mutilated. In Samalakha, two sisters were abducted and raped. Faridabad and Gurugram both witnessed rapes in a moving cars, and in the Gurugram case, such a crime was committed after the husband and brother-in-law of the victim were held hostage.   Besides seeking the Khattar government's dismissal, Naina Chautala has launched a ‘Hari Chunari Ki Chaupal’ campaign, to rally women for creating awareness regarding issues that vitally affect their dignity, life and safety.The relentless deterioration of law and order in Haryana has led to the opposition Congress, and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) firing fresh salvos at the Manohar Lal Khattar-led   (BJP) government in the state. While state Congress president Ashok Tanwar has written an open letter to the people of the state, the INLD through its women's wing, has sought the dismissal of the Khattar government.   With rapes in the state being reported at an average of one every day, the state government once again stood exposed last week, when members of the Karni Sena resorted to violence in protest against the release of Bollywood film  . The situation grabbed national headlines after an alleged attack by the Karni Sena on a school bus carrying children home in Gurugram.  Prior to this, the government had proved to be ineffective in containing outbursts of violence one multiple occasions. Followers of Godman Ram Pal, Jats agitating for reservation, and upset supporters of the jailed Dera Sacha Sauda chief Ram Rahim Singh have all managed to throw the state into chaos during Khattar's reign.",2018-01-27,," Congress, INLD up the ante as Khattar government stands exposed again | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/congress-inld-up-the-ante-as-khattar-government-stands-exposed-again-96915.html

516,Charu Kartikeya,"Businessmen and corporate groups thought 2016-17 was the best year to invest in trusts that fund political parties, an analysis of recent government data has shown.  The data, analysed by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), has shown that donations by various electoral trusts jumped to a massive Rs 325.27 crore from a paltry Rs 49.50 cr in 2015-16. The last such spike in donations was witnessed in 2014-15, an election year, when donations went up to Rs 177.40 crore from Rs 85.37 cr (2013-14). ADR's analysis is on the basis of declarations made by 14 electoral trusts to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). A total of 21 such trusts were registered with the CBDT. Out of the 14 that made submissions, only six declared to have received any donations during that year. The largest amount in such donations has come from Prudent Electoral Trust, which was formerly known as Satya Electoral Trust, whose donors include corporate biggies like Bharti Airtel, Jubilant Foodworks etc. In 2016-17, Prudent received Rs 283.73 cr and distributed Rs 283.72 cr to six parties. This was 87.18% of the total amount donated to all Electoral Trusts in that year. Out of this amout, Prudent donated 88.9%, or Rs 252.22 crore, to the BJP. It donated Rs 14.9 cr to the Congress party, Rs 9 cr to the Shiromani Akal Dal (SAD), Rs 6.5 cr to the   (SP), Rs 1 cr to the Aam Aadmi Party and Rs 10 lakh to the  . Janta Nirvachak Electoral Trust, set up by the Kotak group, donated Rs 25 cr, 100% of its total income, to the BJP. The BJP alone received Rs 290.22 cr, or 89.22%, of the total donations received by all political parties from electoral trusts. Other 9 political parties (including the Congress, SAD, SP etc) received only Rs 35.05 cr collectively. Electoral trusts (Janta Nirvachak Electoral Trust, Paribartan Electoral Trust and Triumph Electoral Trust) have not declared details of cheques given to political parties. Among corporate donors, DLF Limited contributed the most, Rs 28 cr, to Electoral Trusts. It was followed by UPL Ltd and JSW Energy Ltd, with contributions of Rs 25 cr each. Among individuals, Suresh Kotak, the fifth-largest donor among all, donated Rs 18.5 cr to Janta Nirvachak Electoral Trust. Analjit Singh, owner of Max group, donated Rs 1 cr to Prudent Electoral Trust. According to ADR, six trusts donated a total of Rs 105 cr to the national parties before various transparency rules governing contributions to such trusts were formulated, between 2004-05 and 2011-12. These six are: General Electoral Trust, Electoral Trust, Harmony Electoral Trust, Corporate Electoral Trust, Bharti Electoral Trust and Satya Electoral Trust. Since these rules are not retrospective, they were not required to follow the transparency rules and declare their donor details. Thus, these details remain unknown, leading to speculation on ""whether donations to these trusts was only a means of getting tax exemption or a way to convert black money stashed in tax havens to white money in India"". ADR has recommended that details of donors to these Electoral Trusts should also be disclosed. Also, the same rules that apply to those trusts formed after 31 January, 2013, should also apply to the above mentioned Trusts so as to improve transparency. The CBDT should withdraw approval of those electoral trusts that have never received any contributions since their registration, in keeping with the rules. Further, the name of the parent company running the trust should ideally be included in the name of the electoral trust. Also, those Trusts that have not complied with the Election Commission's guidelines should be heavily penalised. ADR has also recommended that all corporates should make details of their political contributions available in public domain.",2018-01-30,, Massive spike in contributions to electoral trusts in note-ban year | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/massive-spike-in-contributions-to-electoral-trusts-in-note-ban-year-97189.html
517,Speed News Desk,"Even as the ruling BJP has been battling anti-incumbency factor on all three seats, it is yet to be seen if the resentment of Rajputs, who openly announced to vote against BJP, would actually result into votes in favour of Congress. Rajputs have been staunch supporters of BJP since its infant days as for Jan Sangh. Particularly, Former Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was the one, who bought majority of Rajputs to get associated with the saffron party.   Nearly two weeks ago, when more than a dozen Rajput, Ravana Rajput, and Charan Rajput organizations held a press conference in Jaipur to declare opposition against BJP, their leaders accused the ruling party of “ignoring” Rajput leaders like Shekhawat and former external affairs minister Jaswant Singh. Political pundits believe that Rajput outfits are in a position to the influence the outcome of Ajmer Lok Sabha seat.  Moreover, low voter turnout in Ajmer city‘s both assembly segments (Ajmer North 55.88%, Ajmer South 59.46%) is being seen as a result of inactiveness of BJP workers as well RSS cadres in the area. Party insiders blamed it on BJP‘s choice of candidate, Ramswaroop Lamba, who despite being a political greenhorn was chosen to encash Jat community‘s sympathy for his father ex-minister Sanwar Lal Jat, whose death necessitated the by-poll. In Alwar Lok Sabha area, the voters‘ resentment against local leadership was being seen a major factor against the ruling party. The Yadav community, which is said to be game-changer in the parliamentary seat, appears to have sympathized with Congress candidate Karan Singh who has made a comeback to politics after a decade. Meanwhile, Mandalgarh assembly seat will see a very tough contest as the voting percentage was also high in the constituency. The Congress and BJP are going neck-to-neck in the contest. Two days after by-polls in Rajasthan were held on two Lok Sabha seats and one assembly seat, intense discussions between the party-men are taking place predicting the results of the elections. Workers and leaders from both sides seem to reach to an idea on the outcome of Alwar parliamentary seat, while they find difficult to forecast the fate of Ajmer Lok Sabha and Mandalgarh assembly segment. The counting of votes on the three seats will be held tomorrow.

518,Sulagna Sengupta,"A section of Bengal’s CPI(M) leadership feel that, considering the BJP’s rise in Bengal, there is a need to ally with the Congress to counter the BJP as early as the upcoming panchayat election as well. At the Central Committee meeting, which concluded  , Yechury proposed the idea for aligning with the Congress for the upcoming elections. In the vote that followed, 55 members voted against Yechury’s proposal, while 31 members voted in favour of it. Speaking in favour of the alliance, a senior CPI(M) leader said, “We feel that an alliance with the Congress is needed to counter the BJP in Bengal. It was seen that CPI(M) alone has been unable to increase its vote share. In 2016 Assembly elections, while Trinamool Congress had registered 53.7 percent vote share Left Front and Congress, which has fought the election after forging an electoral tie up, had registered 34.2 percent vote. BJP had got 8.75 percent vote share.” Former Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who was a senior CPI(M) leader until his expulsion in 2008, said, “I feel that it’s a set back for the CPI(M) not to go for an understanding with the Congress in the upcoming elections. If there is alliance with the Congress, there is a chance for the ailing CPI(M) to revive."" On the other hand, a section of leaders who are in favour of Prakash Karat’s view, which is not to align with Congress, feel that Congress and BJP are not much different in terms of economic policies, and that the Congress has in the past taken a “soft stand” on communal matters too. Sujan Chakraborty, a CPI(M) leader, stated, “We feel that there is no question of aligning with any party for the upcoming election. The CPI(M) alone can mobilise all secular forces. At the recent Sabang by-election too, CPI(M) came to the second position while Congress snagged the fourth position. While TMC candidate Gita Rani Bhunia received 64,000 votes, the Left Front candidate received 41,987 votes and secured the second position. BJP stood third, with around 37,000 votes.”West Bengal’s Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders remain divided on the issue of aligning with the Congress, although  , general secretary of the CPI(M), has already put forward a proposal to align with the Congress for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections to be held in 2019.",2018-01-29,, Is an alliance with Congress the CPI(M)’s only hope for revival? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/is-an-alliance-with-congress-the-cpi-m-s-only-hope-for-revival-97124.html
519,Ramin  Jahanbegloo,"Hassan Rouhani’s re-election in May 2017 as Iranian president seemed to many analysts and observers around the world to be a cry from the country’s people for further moderate domestic and international policy, and a return to the reform and detente agenda. However, the recent protests that shook more than 70 towns around Iran were mainly triggered by discontent over persistent unemployment and inflation, long overdue wages and pensions, the reduction of cash subsidies, environmental degradation, and the collapse of financial institutions.  Iranian leaders, including the Rouhani cabinet, his reformist followers and the Supreme Leader were all surprised by the scale and location of the protests that first erupted over economic grievances and then quickly turned political and spread to long-considered conservative bastions of regime support.  The nature of the protest was surprising not only to the Iranian political elite, which is split and unable to solve the challenges, but it was also felt by the entourage of the Supreme Leader and the security forces who had not heard chants of “Death to the Dictator!” rang out since the Green Movement of 2009.  Iran’s judiciary authorities, in an update about the aftermath of the protests and government response has announced that a total of 25 people had died and nearly 4,000 had been arrested.   Iranian authorities had no trouble controlling the unrest, but it is because of the manner in which protesters shouted against Khamenei and put on fire government offices that this new example of dissent resonated inside and outside Iran.  As such, the protests expressed in many urban and rural areas the broken promise of the revolution. That is the reason why, these kinds of grievances will certainly not go away, and who knows when and where the next spark is going to happen. The changed climate also represents a strong battle which is engaged between Rouhani and his rival conservatives. The government has blamed the conservatives for encouraging protests in their initial phase which ended in anti-regime slogans. Rouhani called upon the Iranian nomenclature to listen to the protesters, not to destroy them.  “We cannot call everybody who takes to the streets' dirt and dust, cow, sheep or trash,” President Rouhani affirmed in a speech broadcast on state television. Assuredly, his government will try a new round of highly media-publicised anti-corruption cases in order to argue that the government is responding to social demands. But the social and economic realities of those marginalised in the rural and provincial periphery will persist.   Let us not forget that the nuclear agreement was supposed to be his key to solving Iran’s problems, but no bright future is in sight. Add to this the atmosphere of uncertainty triggered by Trump administration which has slowed the pace of post-sanctions trade and investment.  Though the US Congress has been wary of having the collapse of the nuclear deal — and its geopolitical ramifications, President Donald Trump has threatened to get out of the nuclear deal in a few months if European countries don’t agree to renegotiate the landmark agreement.  Of course, European countries plus Russia and China have all rejected renegotiation of the accord.   It’s not a secret, the Trump administration has a clear-cut strategy in regard to the Islamic Republic of Iran and its Middle Eastern policy making. Iran’s regional hegemony has been denounced numerous times by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Trump himself.  Yet, the anti-Iran diplomacy of the White House did not succeed in building a consensus on condemning Iran for sweeping the protests at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.  It is very clear that Russia opposed the US push against Iran to be discussed at the Security Council because Nikki Haley had argued that the recent unrest in Iran would escalate into full-blown conflict by drawing a comparison with Syria.  According to the Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia “the US was abusing the Security Council platform and the meeting was an attempt to use the current situation in Iran to undermine the Iran nuclear deal”.  But to the surprise of many people, the French Ambassador to the UN Francois Delattre underlined the fact that the recent events in Iran did not “constitute a threat to peace and international security.”   It is a fact, the recent popular protest in Iran had no leader and no back-up from any political faction. But Trump’s support of the Iranian protesters led, for the first time in Iran, to the popularity of an American president.  Many young Iranians continue to argue that this administration may act differently from that of former president Barack Obama in 2009 when the Green Movement protests were crushed.  That might be the case, but in order for the Trump administration to follow the Iranian news correctly, it needs to collaborate closely with the Europeans, Russia and China on the nuclear deal without necessarily undermining an anti-nuclear proliferation effort that has been a significant success so far.   ",2018-01-29,, Iran After the Unrest: The Great Game Continues | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/iran-after-the-unrest-the-great-game-continues-97196.html
520,Rajeev Khanna,"If one needs to identify a politician who has the knack for digging himself into a political hole   is definitely the apt choice. Remember that he had shifted from the   (BJP) to the Congress at the eleventh hour ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls amid talk of his arrangement with the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) not working out. The local bodies’ minister now stands isolated within the Congress camp as well. Over the last one year Sidhu has managed to remain in the news trying to take on the 'cable mafia' as well as the 'drug mafia' but his party under the leadership of Captain Amarinder Singh has been treading with political caution on these issues. Hence Sidhu's outbursts have not proven fruitful. Recently his disillusionment with the state of affairs in the Congress almost reached the boiling point when he was looked over by the party when it came to choosing the new mayor of Amritsar. This was seen as an insult to the minister who is representing Amritsar (East) constituency in the state Assembly and has represented the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat in the past After going incommunicado for a few days, Sidhu came out to convey that he was 'deeply hurt' at 'not being involved' in the election process for local bodies, especially in the municipal corporations of Patiala, Jalandhar and Amritsar that went to polls in December. He was peeved at both the government and the Congress party not seeking his views while selecting the mayor candidates despite the fact that he is the local bodies’ minister in the state. Sidhu along with 15 municipal councilors seen close to him had stayed away from the Congress party meeting to pick the Amritsar mayor and this had brought substantial embarrassment to the party. Rural development and panchayat minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa had visited Sidhu's house to pacify the belligerent former cricketer but no one reportedly opened the gates of the house for him. The other Congress leaders have expressed their surprise at Sidhu's annoyance saying that the latter had himself signed a statement authorising Amarinder to nominate the city mayor. After conveying his feelings Sidhu attended the Cabinet meeting in Chandigarh last week but reports say that his colleagues showed their resentment over his conduct by not acknowledging his presence and refusing to exchange pleasantries with him. It needs to be pointed out that Sidhu had joined the Congress amid lot of fanfare last January after meeting the then Congress vice president   amid talks of his being made the deputy chief minister in the event of the Congress victory. He joined the Congress campaign pretty late but did come up with some hard hitting in the slog overs at the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-BJP combine in the state. But the elections had eventually turned out to be an Amarinder show and he had to remain content with a Cabinet berth. Till some weeks back he was seen as one of the top leaders in the Congress government along with finance minister Manpreet Badal and health minister Brahm Mohindra, but that position stands squandered. It is also being pointed out that Sidhu's perceived closeness to the Congress president Rahul Gandhi is also doubtful. This is because of his failure to campaign in both the Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat Assembly polls last month. He was a listed star campaigners for both the states where the Congress was fighting a high pitch battle against the BJP, particularly in Gujarat where Rahul himself was seen making the extra effort to resurrect his party. Sidhu is yet to explain why he refrained from taking on the saffron brigade in the poll campaign. The message for him right now is very clear as far as the Congress set up is concerned. He will have to fall in line. Observers say that he has no other political options left. He has surely come a long way from once being seen as a potential chief ministerial candidate of AAP and the deputy chief minister in the Congress regime to having dug himself into a hole. The latest episode of his being disillusioned with the Congress over being sidelined in electing the Amritsar mayor gave an opportunity to the Opposition leaders to take potshots at him as well as the Congress. Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Khaira had gone to the extent of asking Sidhu to join the party. He said that Sidhu has been airing genuine concerns that are being ignored by Amarinder who is not ready to tolerate any person in the Congress with independent views. Meanwhile, the SAD went ahead asking Sidhu to explain why his actions were being welcomed by AAP and why he was collaborating with Khaira and Lok Insaaf Party to destabilise the Congress government. Party leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal said, “We can understand the frustration of AAP and why it is welcoming Sidhu into its fold. But Sidhu should explain why he has started romancing AAP and the Bains brothers immediately after his honeymoon with the Congress has turned sour.” He went on to say that Sidhu has always shown hunger for power and has dropped one party to join another to fulfill his political aspirations. “It seems he now feels he won’t be able to achieve his ends in the Congress party and has started making new combinations,” he said. Asserting that Sidhu was resorting to tantrums because he had been thwarted from having his say in the appointment of mayors of municipal corporations, the Akali leader said this is nothing new. “Earlier also Sidhu has always resorted to blackmail to have his say in the BJP. This shows he is with the Congress only till he can rule the roost,” the Akali leader said. As of now Sidhu stands isolated in the political spectrum of Punjab. How he manages to take the centre stage again remains to be seen.",2018-01-31,, Sherry in a corner: How Navjot Sidhu stands isolated in Punjab politics | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/sherry-in-a-corner-how-navjot-sidhu-stands-isolated-in-punjab-politics-97449.html
521,Aditya Menon,"BJP tried every trick in the book to win the bypolls but nothing seems to have worked for the saffron party. Nowhere is this more evident than in Alwar. Here the BJP candidate Jaswant Singh Yadav had blatantly tried to polarise the electorate on communal lines when he said, “If you’re Hindu, vote for me and if you’re Muslim, vote for the Congress”. It must be remembered that Alwar has been the epicenter of several attacks on Muslims by cow vigilantes, such as the lynching of Pehlu Khan last year. Congress’ Karan Singh Yadav, who had represented the seat from 2004 to 2009, has emerged victorious with a huge margin of 1.96 lakh votes. BJP had won the seat by a margin of 2.8 lakh in 2014. Another former MP Bhanwar Jitendra Singh also played a key role in Yadav’s victory, especially in weaning away a section of the Rajput community from the BJP. On the other hand, Rajput outfits appear to have mobilised support against the BJP. They are upset with the BJP because of the encounter of gangster Anandpal Singh as well as the party's “ambiguous” position on the movie  The Congress also won Ajmer, which is a personal triumph for Rajasthan Congress chief Sachin Pilot as he had represented the seat from 2009 to 2014. Here the party’s candidate Raghu Sharma won by a margin of over 80,000 votes.  There appears to have been a major consolidation of the Jat community behind the Congress. According to reports, BJP got zero votes in Adarwa, a Jat dominated polling booth in Dudu Assembly segment of Ajmer. This, despite the fact that the BJP had fielded a Jat while the Congress had fielded a Brahmin.  In Mandalgarh, Congress rebel Gopal Malviya gave a scare to the party’s official candidate Vivek Dhakar by cornering over 40000 votes. However, the  Congress still managed to win by a margin of 12,976 votes. The swing against the BJP is particularly huge in Alwar. Compared to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP’s vote share has fallen by 20% while the Congress’ has increased by 24%. In Mandalgarh, the BJP’s vote share has fallen by 23%, while the Congress’ has increased by 3%. The real beneficiary here has been the rebel Congress candidate.The ruling   (BJP) has suffered a humiliating defeat in the by-elections to the Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha seats and Mandalgarh Vidhan Sabha seat in Rajasthan. This is bad news for Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje because if the trends reflected in the by-polls continue, she is heading for a massive rout in the Assembly elections later this year.   People in 17 Vidhan Sabha segments out of Rajasthan’s 200 constituencies voted in these by-elections. The BJP’s vote share fell by 6% in these constituencies put together compared to the 2013 Vidhan Sabha elections. Compare it to the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, it is an even bigger fall: 14%. If this swing is replicated in the Vidhan Sabha elections, BJP’s tally in Rajasthan could fall by over 100 seats.",2018-02-01,, Congress wins Rajasthan bypolls: Why Raje & Modi are in for a major rout in the state | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/congress-wins-rajasthan-bypolls-why-raje-modi-are-in-for-a-major-rout-in-the-state-97653.html

524,Atul Chandra,"Singh was chosen by a committee headed by UP Chief Secretary Rajiv Kumar. The 1983 batch IPS officer, who has been Lucknow’s Senior Superintendent of Polcie (SSP) thrice, was chosen over four others in the race – Pravin Kumar Singh, Surya Kumar Shukla, Rajiv Rai Bhatnagar and Gopal Gupta. However, for all his achievements, Singh’s first day as Lucknow’s SSP on 2 June, 1995, must be the most forgettable day of his career. On that eventful day,   goons lay siege to the State Guest House on Mirabai Marg where Bahujan Samaj Party leader   was staying and almost killed her. The district police had surrendered its powers before the Samajwadi Party leaders and goondas who were angry with Mayawati for withdrawing support to  . For Mayawati, the situation could have been uglier had the late   leader Brahm Dutt Dwivedi not saved her from the attackers. OP Singh, who took over as SSP, Lucknow, on that fateful day, was criticized for letting his men remain mute spectators and allowing the Samajwadi Party men to break the law with impunity. Having been appointed SSP by Mulayam, it was then alleged that he was returning the favour. Those who backed him argued that he hardly had time to understand the situation. It was, therefore, no surprise that when Mayawati became Chief Minister, Singh was placed under suspension. Mulayam later rewarded Singh by creating the post of Additional Director-General of Police, Noida, especially for him. As DG, CISF, Singh is credited with making airports safer. He has also been the DG, National Disaster Response Force, and was presented with the Distinguished Leadership Award for Disaster Resilience for his handling of major disasters like the Nepal earthquake and urban floods in Chennai and J&K. For the winner of Indian Police Medals for Gallantry, Distinguished Services and for Meritorious Services, a bigger challenge awaits in UP, where the government is desperate to make the state crime-free. 28 criminals have been killed in 895 encounters since the formation of this government, with Chief Minister   even giving a carte blanche to the police force to carry out encounters and show the criminals “oopar ka raasta”. However, the crime situation has only improved marginally. According to the National Crime Record Bureau report of 2016, UP registered the highest number of cases – 2,82,171 – under IPC sections in the country. These included 4,889 murders, 284 cases of dacoity, 4,816 rapes and 49,262 other cases of crime against women. As DGP, with an assured tenure of almost two years, OP Singh, or whosoever is named in his place, will have to see if the number of cases under the IPC can be brought down without resorting to the usual practice of non-registration of FIRs. Criminals are not the only ones to contend with, though. The attitude of policemen, whether they are dealing with foreign tourists, sexually harassed women or commoners, and committing excesses is a far bigger challenge. His predecessor, Sulkhan Singh, found policemen in UP to be worse than the Britishers. In honesty and behaviour he found the British police to have been far better than the present-day UP Police. “In the entire freedom movement you can find instances of excesses but not a single case of faking, fake encounter, fake evidences and fake investigations,” Sulkhan Singh told a national daily. That pithily sums up the situation, which may now be beyond improvement, unless the new DGP refuses to be a stooge of politicians and bureaucrats.The Centre, it appears, has played spoilsport by not acting on the Uttar Pradesh government’s request to relieve senior IPS officer Om Prakash Singh, so that he may be instated as the state’s Director-General of Police. The post has been lying vacant since 31 December, 2017, when DGP Sulkhan Singh retired from office. At present, Singh is the Director General of the Central Industrial Security Force and, given his reputation of being an efficient officer, the state government wanted him as state police chief. It is unprecedented for the Centre to sit on a state’s request for well over a fortnight, and this has caused embarrassment to the state. The Centre’s reluctance to repatriate Singh has fuelled rumours of a cold war between New Delhi and the state government. It has now become a prestige issue between the Centre and the state. By not naming any other officer to head the state’s police force, the UP government has made it obvious that it was not going to let the Centre ignore its request.",2018-01-19,, UP-New Delhi cold war intensifies as Centre ignores Yogi Adityanath's DGP demands | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/national-news/up-new-delhi-cold-war-intensifies-as-centre-ignores-yogi-adityanath-s-dgp-demands-95746.html

It was in June 2015 that Delhi-based advocate Prashant Patel had petitioned then President   to disqualify 21 MLAs of the AAP, because they were holding parallel offices of profit, he alleged. In March that year, Delhi Chief Minister   had appointed these MLAs as parliamentary secretaries, a position which Patel alleged was an office of profit. Mukherjee then referred the case to the EC for its opinion, which the latter then took nearly two years to formulate and provide. Armed with the recommendation, it is up to the President now to determine the future course of action. However, much has happened in the last 2 years that could have had a crucial impact on the case but appears to have been ignored. In September, 2015, another private petition had led the Delhi high court to strike down the post of parliament secretary itself, ruling that the appointment of the MLAs on the posts was unconstitutional, because the LG had not given his assent. AAP has since then been arguing that since the appointment itself was quashed, no office-of-profit case arose. Former secretary general of the Lok Sabha PDT Achary, a well-known Constitution expert, supports the contention. Achary told Catch that EC conducted hearings only on the maintainability of the case and not its merits. He said the High Court ruling meant that the MLAs had served as parliamentary secretaries not even for a moment as the very posts were declared unconstitutional. This is a point which ought to have been considered, Achary asserted, by the EC. He said he was at a loss to understand how the EC had given its final recommendation without hearing the MLAs. Achary also pointed out that following the High Court's ruling, the issue became a legal one and EC is not an authority that can decide on a legal issue. The case should have been heard by a court of law, he noted. With AAP also taking the same line, a protracted legal battle does appear imminent if the President decides to disqualify the MLAs. In that case, Delhi appears headed for another round of bitter political turmoil.  With the Election Commission recommending the disqualification of 20   MLAs accused of holding office of profit, the ball is now in President  's court. Since Delhi is not a full-fledged state, it is the President, and not the Lieutenant Governor, who has the power to disqualify an MLA on such grounds. His decision, however, is not immune from judicial appeal. If he does decide to disqualify the AAP MLAs, the latter can appeal against that order in the Delhi High Court. EC's recommendation has come as a momentary setback for AAP, which will be exacerbated if the President takes an adverse decision. It will not send, at the outset, the AAP-government in Delhi crumbling down, because even after losing 20 MLAs the party will continue to have 2/3rd majority in the Assembly. However, it will be a moral boost for the opposition parties like BJP and Congress, which have already started demanding resignation of the government on moral grounds.",2018-01-20,"aap news,AAP MLA,20 AAP MLAs,aap mla rejectet,AAP Office of Profit Case", EC disqualifies 20 AAP MLAs: Why didn’t it hear merits of the case? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/ec-disqualifies-20-aap-mlas-why-didn-t-it-hear-merits-of-the-case-95885.html
529,News Agencies," would lead from the front of the Congress in poll-bound Karnataka, launching the campaign with a three-day tour from February 10, a key state party leader said today. Working President of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, Dinesh Gundu Rao, also indicated that party MLAs facing anti-incumbency in their constituencies, may not get tickets in polls, due in May. He added that joining hands with the JD(S) in case Congress fails to get a majority is not being looked at as an option as his party is confident of coming to power on its own, and also that the H D Deve Gowda-led outfit is ""not dependable"". Speaking to PTI here, Gundu Rao said Gandhi is going to be a ""very key"" campaigner for the Congress in the state where he noted, it also has ""very powerful"" state leaders like Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, M Mallikarjuna Kharge, G Parameshwara and D K Shivakumar. ""At the same time, I think Rahulji is getting resonance amongst people, and he is leading the campaign for us,"" Gundu Rao, who was here to attend an event, said. The Congress president is starting his campaign with a three-day tour of the state from February 10. He might visit again later next month and also in March. ""In the run-up to the elections, he will be spending lot more time, and he is definitely going to lead from the front for us"", he said. ""We have started our campaign from KPCC and the chief minister has also toured the state"", he said. ""Gandhi would be intensively campaigning and you can say more or less launch of the campaign for the Congress (with his February tour),"" the Congress leader added. He claimed there is no anti-incumbency on the government because out of 165 promises made in the election manifesto, it has implemented 155-156. In fact, Gundu Rao said the Congress is seeing pro-incumbency wave creeping in, adding, it would win a number of seats than the last time. Gundu Rao, however, said that some Congress MLAs might have ""built-up"" anti-incumbency in their constituencies. ""That's what we need to look out for. If they have not done well, we have to change then, that's going to be the key thing,"" he said. Congress MLAs facing anti-incumbency will be ""definitely changed"", as the party's aim is to field ""best available candidates"", he said. On whether the Congress would look for an understanding with JD(S) in case it falls short on numbers in the post-poll scenario, he said, ""There is no question of us wanting an alliance because we are clearly in the race to get an absolute majority."" ""But post-poll...what happens...who knows? I can't predict right now. JD(S) is not dependable. They have been with BJP, they have formed a government with us, they are not people who can be trusted because they don't have an ideology, don't have fixed agenda, they can play anything; they are not dependable at all.

530,Rajeev Khanna,"There is hardly any sympathy for him, be it from the common man on the ground or those who once treated him like the emperor of the Hindutva cause. To understand why, one need only to look at the kind of messages being circulated about him in Gujarat, something which was unimaginable when Prime Minister   was campaigning for his all important 2002 assembly polls, when Togadia was at his rabble-rousing best.  , people are joking about his 'Trishul Diksha Samarohs' (trident distribution events), wondering whether the miniature tridents can now be used for consuming 'Chinese noodles'. There are audio messages from his Hindu followers doing the rounds, where people are reminding him of his slogan ' Jis Hindu ka khoon na khaule, khoon nahin wo paani hai ' ( A Hindu's blood that does not boil over the injustice being done to him is nothing but water), and underlining how a mere threat of an arrest has led him to succumb and shed tears. These Hindu followers are now exhorting him to stand up and fight against the forces that have finished off democracy and freedom in Gujarat, as well as in the country.  Togadia is now talking about the threat to his life, his voice being strangulated, and his human rights being violated. While any civil society would stand by him on these issues, he needs to be reminded of his own conduct over the years on the very same issues. People in Gujarat have vivid memories of former chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela showing the political nerve to put him behind bars when he threatened that Gujarat would burn if he was arrested. He was released only after some sort of a political truce was reached.  Togadia shot into limelight after the Godhra train burning incident and the mass killings of Muslims in 2002. He complimented Narendra Modi's communally charged campaign for the 2002 assembly polls, spitting venom in the 100-plus rallies that he addressed.  Under his leadership the VHP came out with a series of programmes that were nothing but regressive. Togadia never uttered a word on the series of police encounters that followed Modi's victory in 2002 in which majority of those killed were Muslims. This was pretty much along expected lines. But despite the relations between the two starting to sour, the VHP under Togadia continued with his diabolical anti-minority campaign.  I would like to bring out a series of examples of the mindset that the VHP helped create in Gujarat, something that Modi and the Sangh Parivar have always peddled as a 'model'. I am reminded of the day when during the American bombing of Iraq all the major newspapers had carried a picture of a torso of an Iraqi child whose arms and legs had been blown off. On the very same evening, the VHP had carried out a demonstration in support of the US President George W. Bush-sanctioned invasion of Iraq, with the majority of the participants in the VHP demonstration being doctors and chartered accountants, a segment that is assumed to be among the most educated. The purpose of the event, as one of the demonstrators told me, was to let the Americans know that Gujarati Hindus supported the American action and it would help more people get those coveted American visas.  Then on the second anniversary of the Godhra train burning incident Togadia had called for a memorial meeting of those killed and the media was requested to cover the meeting. There, he was seen referring to the media, particularly the English press, as ' Bhoot and prets ' (demons and devils), even asking the VHP workers and supporters to keep them at a distance.  , he is seeking the help of the same media to air his apprehensions.  It was under his leadership that the VHP cadres had erected gates in localities like Ghatlodia in Ahmedabad, where it was written, “ Hindu Rashtra ki Karnavati Nagri ke XXX Vistar mein Hindu Bhaiyon ka Swagat Hai ” The message broadly translates to 'Hindu brother are welcome in XXX locality of Karnavati (the name by which the saffron camp refers to Ahmedabad since the latter is Muslim sounding) in the Hindu nation'. What more glaring example of the violation of the very preamble of the Constitution could there be.  It was again under Togadia's leadership that the first protest had been organized at Income Tax circle in Ahmedabad against former deputy prime minister Lal Krishna Advani praising Quaid-e-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah during his visit to Pakistan in 2005. There were slogans raised in which Advani was called a 'Hijra' and 'Jinnah Bhakt'. He had to quit as the BJP president.  It was during this tenure that there were frequent reports of VHP organising armed training for its cadres, particularly women, in Nikol area of Ahmedabad. The outfit had even put up a banner of a marriage bureau outside its office, which was taken off when I started asking about it in regard to a news story. Probably the VHP marriage bureau was established to help 'ideal Hindu' couples tie the knot.  But his power base was fast eroding, while that of Modi, who was his his bete noire by now, was getting consolidated. I had come across a mellowed down Togadia in 2011 in Haldwani,Uttarakhand, where he was more keen on popularising Swadeshi products – right from toothpaste to soaps, along with his favourite Gau mutra.  The VHP was nowhere in the picture during the 2007, 2012, and, most importantly, the recent Gujarat elections. And then came the episode of Togadia going missing and subsequently being found. He is now facing arrests and warrants in cases that are as old as two decades. The wheel has surely come full circle. It is Togadia's own brand of politics that has come back to haunt him. Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) supremo Pravin Togadia   stands marginalised even in his beloved saffron camp. Things seem to have come a full circle in the last two decades, with Togadia having made a laughing stock of himself, despite airing some very serious allegations such as designs to eliminate him and his voice being suppressed on the issues of Ram Mandir, cow protection and Uniform Civil Code. Issues that have all been very dear to him.",2018-01-19,, Paranoid and powerless: How the wheel has come full circle for Togadia | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/national-news/paranoid-and-powerless-how-the-wheel-has-come-full-circle-for-togadia-95896.html

539,Charu Kartikeya,"With every passing day, Lalu is sharpening this narrative because he needs it to spread and take root. In his scheme of things, it is the only tool to ensure that his core supporters do not desert his party during the period he will spend in jail. His prison sentence will run for 3 years, unless he gets bail. Not that this is the first time the veteran politician has been convicted and imprisoned. The many cases related to the notorious fodder scam have sent him to jail on multiple occasions, beginning with a judicial remand of 134 days way back in 1997. However, it is the genius of his politics that Lalu is still not just relevant to politics in Bihar, but is at the top of the game. His party managed to retain its tally of 4 seats in Lok Sabha even in the midst of the Modi-wave in the 2014 polls. When it came to the crucial assembly polls test just next year, RJD emerged as the single largest party, bagging 80 seats and taking its Grand Alliance with JD(U) and Congress to a massive 178 out of the 243 seats Lalu Yadav is neither the first nor the only politician in India convicted in a corruption case. From Sukhram to A Raja to Madhu Koda to Jayalalitha to Om Prakash Chautala, there are many similar examples. However, Lalu stands apart from all of them, in spite of sharing the dubious distinction of being not just accused of graft, but also convicted. The careers of Sukh Ram, A Raja and Madhu Koda are all but over and their names have faded from public life. Jayalalitha is no more but till she was alive, the corruption cases against her didn't dent her electoral career. Similar is the case with Chautala, with his INLD being the largest party in the opposition in Haryana even as he himself cools his heels in jail. Like Lalu, Chautala is also a leader of a subaltern community. Jats and Muslims in Haryana predominantly flock to his party, just as Yadavs and Muslims in Bihar back the RJD. For Lalu, there is the additional support of sections of Dalits as well as few non-Yadav OBC groups. The biggest difference, however, that sets him apart from Chautala and Jayalalitha is his consistent opposition to BJP and its Hindutva-based politics. Both INLD and   have been constituents of the BJP-led NDA in the past, but RJD has never allied with the BJP. Lalu has, in fact, pitted BJP as a permanent foe of socialist forces, labeling their relationship as one of struggle between the politics of “Mandal” and “kamandal”. So, is a politics of the sub-altern the magic behind the continued relevance of Lalu Yadav in Bihar? And if that is the case, will he continue to loom large over politics in the state and will spring a surprise in the next elections too? Lalu's latest conviction is likely to make the Yadavs further consolidate behind him and his party, feels Prof Naval Kishore Chaudhary, former principal, Patna College. He says Yadavs are the state's biggest vote bank and are the most politically aware, essentially explaining how Lalu's early espousal of their cause has been his biggest support so far. Additionally, in these charged times, the Muslims have no other choice in the state than RJD and Congress, Chaudharya also stressed. This M-Y combination is enough to keep Lalu ahead of all other rival forces in the state. However, Chaudhary cautioned that the real crisis for RJD will emerge if Lalu's son and former deputy chief minister   also gets convicted in the ED's case against him. Mahendra Suman, Bihar-based political analyst, agrees that Lalu's Yadav-base will become stronger, but he says that will not be enough from saving RJD from weakening post his conviction. Suman points out that Lalu's politics has spanned over 25 years now and he has faced a sort of demonisation among the intelligentsia all this while. Historically, Suman continues, Lalu and RJD are weakening. Lalu succeeded in only the first battle of the social justice movement, by delivering power and respect for the backwards communities. However, he failed in taking the movement to its logical conclusion by also leading those communities to wealth and knowledge, Suman said. He also added that the coming up of many parties and leaders has led to erosion even in Lalu's core M-Y vote bank. Political analyst Vinod Anupam also agrees that Lalu's latest conviction will weaken the RJD and the re-entry that Lalu was making into Bihar's socio-political space will be halted. When pointed out that senior leaders like Abdul Bari Siddiqui, Jagadanand Singh, Shivanand Tiwari and others still hanging around, Anupam emphasises that Lalu never let them rise and always promoted his family over them. His sons, Anupam says, haven't matured politically yet and will find it tough to cope with the all-out assault mounted against them. He reminded that Tejashwi, Lalu's wife Rabri Davi and their daughter Misa Bharti are all facing corruption cases and Lalu's network in Bihar, like among the sand mafia and among bureaucrats, is also facing the heat. It is perhaps one of the greatest ironies of politics that careers can be built and advanced against corruption as well as in spite of it. While the Aam Aadmi Party came into existence following an anti-corruption movement, corruption has proved to be the undoing of Lalu Yadav and Rashtriya  . However, Lalu has demonstrated repeatedly that to write his political obituary is the biggest mistake one can make. The old warhorse is still fighting. So don't be surprised if he kicks his heels up once again and gallops away to glory.Two days after RJD chief   was convicted in one of the cases related to the fodder scam, his twitter handle sent out what then seemed like an innocuous tweet. “Dear friends! While in jail, My Twitter handle shall be operated by my office in consultation with family. I shall speak my mind through visitors. The fight to preserve the Constitution & protect the rights of vulnerable groups shall go on”, declared the tweet. About a fortnight later, it is now becoming clear that the necessity to tweet is a key pillar of the strategy devised by the former Bihar chief minister to counter the setback his conviction is likely to inflict. He has tweeted almost everyday since then and the central theme is to paint his conviction as a conspiracy of upper-caste 'fascists' and himself as their victim.",2018-01-09,," What sets Lalu apart from other netas convicted in graft cases – Sukh Ram, A Raja, Jayalalithaa & Chautala? | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/what-sets-lalu-apart-from-other-netas-convicted-in-graft-cases-sukh-ram-a-raja-jayalalithaa-chautala-94750.html
540,Ashwin Aghor,"Buoyed by its performance in the Gujarat Assembly elections, the Congress is now aiming to recapture power in Maharashtra, which goes to the polls in 2019. As a first step, the Congress leadership has begun making overtures to its former ally Nationalist Congress Party, which had parted ways from it in the run-up to the 2014 Assembly elections. However, it is easier said than done. The NCP’s support has eroded over the past few years and there is an atmosphere of distrust surrounding the party supremo Sharad Pawar, especially given his tendency to give ambiguous statements.   Senior journalist and political analyst Ganesh Torsekar feels that Pawar has completely lost credibility in recent “Pawar is on sticky wicket now. Marathas and OBCs are unhappy with him due to his summersaults over Bhima Koregaon violence. In this situation, Pawar needs help from other parties to keep himself and his party relevant. And Congress is its natural ally,” Torsekar says. Torsekar feels that if Congress and NCP come together, it might not harm BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections but they could make it difficult for the BJP to come back to power in Maharashtra.   Going by the vote percentage in 2014 Assembly elections, BJP got 27% votes,   got 19%, Congress 18% and NCP 17.2%. He said that NCP snapped ties with Congress in 2014 under pressure from BJP. Pawar wanted to protect nephew Ajit Pawar and party leader Sunil Tatkare who are among the accused in the multi-crore irrigation scam in Maharashtra. However, veteran journalist Nikhil Wagle praised Pawar and NCP for their role in containing the violence. “I have criticised NCP and Sharad Pawar in the past. But they deserve credit for their efforts to maintain peace after the incident,” Wagle said in a recent interview. Shiv Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande said, “We will not reveal our cards as of now. At present we are concentrating on consolidating our position in the state. A massive party revamp programme is going on at the district level”. She further added, “While there is a talk about a possible Congress – NCP alliance, it is still not clear. Given Pawar’s style of politics, no one can trust him. Similarly, BJP too is not trustworthy. Before the elections, they made tall claims that Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare would be put behind the bars. But nothing has happened. Given the proximity of Pawar and  , it is difficult to understand how Congress can trust NCP.” However, according to Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari, “Pawar has no option but to align with Congress. He has completely lost credibility and NCP leaders are worried about their future. It is a matter of survival for both Congress and NCP. No one should be surprised if a large number of NCP leaders quit party and join Congress in the near future.” Referring to the threat due to a possible alliance, he said that BJP would not be affected at all.       ",2018-01-09,, Maharashtra: Congress makes overtures towards NCP.

541,Priyata Brajabasi,"The MLA attacked Prime Minister   on various issues, saying, “It is you (PM Modi) who has to answer for the violence on Dalits - in Saharanpur, in Bhima Koregaon and Mumbai. You have to answer why Rohith Vemula was killed. You have to answer why people are not getting the money that rich Indians have illegally parked in foreign accounts. You have to answer why millions of youth are not getting dignified jobs despite promises. Why was Akhil Gogoi charged under the National Security Act?” “The PM is covering up real issues of corruption, poverty, unemployment, fall of GDP, inflation and increase in taxes and things like ghar wapasi, love jihad, Hindutva, and cows are being given importance We are not love jihad guys. We're pyaar ishq muhabbat type of guys. We will celebrate April 14 (Ambedkar Jayanti) as well as February 14 (Valentine’s Day).” Mevani also explained his election symbol and said, “I am a sewing machine man. I have come to stitch people together.” Mevani's election symbol was a sewing machine in the recent Assembly elections in Gujarat’s Vadgam seat. Speaking about attacks on Dalits, ""I have been charged with instigating violence in Bhima Koregaon. Everybody knows that is not true. I am being targeted because Alpesh Thakor,   and Jignesh Mevani were able to shatter the ruling party arrogance and over-confidence of winning with 150 seats. We brought them down to 99. Since then I am their number one target."" The Pune Police filed an FIR against Mevani and Umar Khalid after receiving a written complaint about their allegedly provocative comments at an event in Maharashtra. Mevani also questioned the PM on caste discrimination across the country saying, “Here I have the Manusmriti in one hand and the Constitution of India in the other. Which one are you going to choose, Mr PM?” Several other speakers attacked the Modi government on the violence against Dalits in Maharashtra, attack on liberal/ left-leaning educational institutions like Jawaharlal Nehru University, gender injustice, farmer suicides, youth unemployment and the disappearance of JNU student Najeeb Ahmed. Although many news publications and users took to social media to point out the weak attendance at the rally, there were in fact over 400 people at the rally that started at 1pm. Former JNU student union president Kanhaiya Kumar even addressed reports of low attendance, saying, “We don’t have crowds, I agree. We don’t have large hired crowds like the ones at BJP rallies, but we have real, living breathing people seated on chairs here who genuinely believe in our cause.” Kanhaiya also attracted a lot of cheers from the crowd when he took jibes at the ruling party’s close association with the Reliance Industries. Kanhaiya said, “When tax evaders like Mukesh Ambani’s son Anant Ambani claims Reliance meri jaan hai (Reliance is my life), his mother, Nita Ambani claps in front of   and media portrays it as a great act of nationalism. No one asks him to chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai or sing Vande Matram to prove his patriotism. But when Radhika Vemula demands justice, we are accused of playing caste politics. When Najeeb’s mother asks about the whereabouts of his missing son, we are labeled as communal. Can you ask the Ambanis to say ‘Vande Mantram’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ to prove their nationalism?” Kanhaiya observed how several media organisations took down articles on Anant Ambani’s speech from their websites, saying, “At this point in time in our country people can even mock the Prime Minister but not Ambani’s son.” The Yuva Hunkar Rally made it clear that the Left forces have found a posterboy in Jignesh Mevani. It is expected that he will continue addressing gatherings of the youth across the country.Despite rumours of cancellation of the Yuva Hunkar rally circulating on social media and some news channels, youth leaders from across the country gathered at Parliament Street in the national capital to protest the recent caste-based violence in Maharashtra and the arrest of Bhim Army founder Chandrashekar Azad in Uttar Pradesh. Azad was arrested last year in connection with the Thakur-Dalit clashes in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur district and has since been in judicial custody. Among the speakers at the rally were Dalit leader and recently elected MLA from Gujarat’s Vadgam, Jignesh Mevani, farmers’ rights activist from Assam Akhil Gogoi, student leaders Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, Shehla Rashid, Richa Singh and Mohit Pandey, Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, Delhi University Teachers’ Association member Nandita Narain, among others. Although authorities had maintained till the last minute that the organisers of the rally did not have permission to hold the event, it seems the rally organisers and Delhi Police reached a compromise.

542,Nishant  Chhabra,"Sachin Pilot is trying hard to prove his mettle in the state by winning the by-elections but his difficulties arise from the in-fighting among the top brass in the Congress in the state.  For the BJP also, a number of national and state-level developments are posing a serious challenge. They include issues like demonetisation and GST brought about by the NDA Government at the Centre and the killing of the gangster Anandpal last year in a police encounter. The pending issue of farm loan waiver is also an irritant for the ruling party.  Keeping in mind the challenges, Chief Minister  Raje herself is campaigning in the constituencies. Same is the case with Pilot, who is hitting the roads to boost his party’s prospects. However, apart from the personality factors and the political and economic issue one aspect that stands out in all the three  constituencies is the caste factor. This is more so as the candidates have been fielded by both the parties after taking into consideration their respective castes. For Ajmer, BJP has fielded former MP Sanwar Lal Jat’s son Ramswaroop Lamba. The Jats are the second largest community here after the Schedule Caste voters. The seat has more than three lakh SC voters followed 2.5 lakh Jats. The Muslims, Rajputs and Gurjars individually constitute 2 lakh voters each. Others include more than 1.5 lakh Brahmins, Banias and Rawats and Mali voters. The Congress choice in Ajmer, Raghu Sharma, is a senior leader in the State. He has served as the chief whip of the party in the state in the past. In Alwar, the Congress has fielded Karan Singh Yadav while the BJP has gone for  Jaswant Singh Yadav. Both the parties have targeted the dominant Yadav vote bank. There is more than two lakh Yadav voters in the constituency bordering Haryana. Alwar has an equal number of Brahmins, Meo Muslims and Scheduled Castes (SCs). The electorate here also include more than a lakh Meenas, 80,000 Malis and 50,000 Rajputs. In Mandalgarh, Dhakkads, a farming community,  numbering about 40,000, form the majority of the voters. Besides them, there are more than 30,000, SC/STs,  25,000 Brahmins, and around 10,000 Rajputs. Targeting the dominant Dhakads the Congress has fielded Vivek Dhakad,  a local leader while the BJP has given the ticket to  Shakti Singh Hada, a senior BJP leader in Bhilwara district.Considered as the semifinals for the Assembly polls scheduled later this year in Rajasthan, the crucial by-polls for the two Lok Sabha constituencies and one Assembly seat are all set to be fought on the caste lines rather than on issues or the personal merits of the candidates. The polls have become an issue of prestige between the BJP Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and the Congress leaders, the former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and the Pradesh Congress Committee president, Sachin Pilot. While all three seats were won by the BJP in the previous elections, retaining them appears to be an uphill task for the saffron party owing to a number of factors. ",2018-01-20,, Caste is the Credo in Rajasthan By-polls | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/caste-is-the-credo-in-rajasthan-by-polls-95992.html
543,Sulagna Sengupta,"According to BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, Basu's decision to side with TMC was not without pressure. “TMC has threatened Manju Basu and that’s why she supported Trinamool Congress,” Ghosh claimed, adding, “The TMC leaders have taken law in their own hands and people are frightened to voice their support for us.” However, state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee rubbished the claims. “It is not easy to poach our leaders by simply playing gimmick. People support Banerjee and we are confident that our vote share will increase in the upcoming by elections. BJP is trying to divide people on religious lines  and that's why people support us,"" he reiterated. This tussle has already had a casualty, a BJP worker named Anisur Rahman who had defected to the BJP from the TMC a month prior. On  , an FIR was lodged against Rahman, a resident of Panskura in East Midnapore, accusing him of sexual assault. He was subsequently arrested and produced in court. However, Ghosh alleges that this is nothing more than political vendetta, claiming, “Trinamool Congress is trying to frame false charges against Rahman as he joined BJP from TMC.” On  , CM Mamata Banerjee stated that the Rashtriya Swamsevak Sangh (RSS) had set up an NGO that was sending RSS teachers to indoctrinate children in tribal areas. This, she said, was being done in the name of nationalism. Speaking at a public rally in Alipurduar, North Bengal, Banerjee said “Do not accept such kind of proposal from any organisation. In the name of imparting education, RSS is trying to impart extremist education to children . I have also received information that one RSS backed organisation has distributed some booklets to Class II students at Uluberia in Howrah, where they have mentioned false claims against Prophet Muhammad.” Mamata assured her followers that an FIR has been lodged against the offending NGO.   However, Mamata has a lot to be wary about when it comes to the RSS. According to the RSS, while in 2014 there were 1,280 shakhas in Bengal, that number has increased to 1,492 in  . Of the total number of shakhas, south Bengal has the majority with 1,069, whereas north Bengal has 426. There has also been an increase in the number of RSS-affiliated schools, with around 309 RSS-affiliated primary schools in the state at present, with around 3,193 appointed educators teaching around 66,090 students.On  , when the   (BJP) announced two-time Trinamool Congress (TMC) MLA Manju Basu as its candidate for the upcoming Noapara byelections, it seemed like a blow to the TMC. However, mere hours after the announcement, Basu issued a statement saying that she remained a “loyal soldier” of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and that the BJP had acted without her knowledge.  While the BJP has since selected Sandip Banerjee, its Barrackpore district chief, as its new candidate for the Noapara seat, this tussle for support is indicative of a fierce battle being fought between the BJP and TMC to maintain control over their followers in light of the upcoming Noapara and Uluberia bypolls. While the Trinamool Congress is trying hard to ensure that no TMC workers shift their allegiance to BJP, BJP workers are doing their best to poach from their rival's camp.",2018-01-10,, Mamata's latest challenge: BJP poaching and RSS propaganda | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/mamata-s-latest-challenge-bjp-poaching-and-rss-propaganda-94858.html

A bench of the High Court while hearing a PIL though told the state government that it must take earnest steps to address the genuine grievances of the employees and pay forthwith to them the statutory dues. Launching the strike on January 4, the union had said that they were compelled to go on the stir, as despite “21 rounds of talks in the last 16 months” the government failed to arrive at a decision regarding the unions’ demands for wage revision. The day also saw the Tamil Nadu government introducing a Bill in the Assembly proposing to double the monthly salary and other allowances for MLAs. The MLAs salary hike bill attracted widespread criticism with DMK staging a walkout from the Assembly. “People will laugh at us for this hike when transport workers in the state are on strike demanding salary hike,” said DMK working president MK Stalin. While the state government has been repeatedly urged to call of the strike and called for negotiations, the trade unions are adamant at continuing the stir until their demands are accepted by the government. While Chief Minister reiterated the government’s willingness to increase wages by 2.44 times, the trade unions have refused to concede and have lambasted the government for the MLA salary hike bill.  “The Tamil Nadu government continues to be insensitive towards the workers’ demands. The government is more focused on keeping the MLAs happy by giving them a salary bonanza but is least concerned about the plight of the workers,” said CITU general secretary Tapan Sen. Describing the stir as being for the sake of the workers as also for the common people of the state, the unions have said they will intensify the stir. Joined by their family members, including children, workers staged demonstrations outside divisional offices of state-owned transport corporations across the state.  “It is nothing but our own money that the government has illegally misappropriated. Most of the sum amounting to Rs. 5,500 crore was not deposited into our PF (provident fund) accounts and we cannot even take loans,” said Soundararajan Tamil Nadu has over 22,000 buses with a workforce of about 143,000 employees. The employees have been fighting for over a year for wage revision and for clearance of arrears that amount to Rs7,543 crore, including retirement benefits and provident fund.Transport workers’ unions in Tamil Nadu have decided to carry on their indefinite stir notwithstanding the Tamil Nadu government’s announcement to release Rs 750 crore towards retirement benefits. The indefinite strike by 17 trade unions including the CITU and DMK-backed Labour Progressive Federation (LPF) entered the seventh day leaving the state crippled. While there have been reports of the trade unions willing to call of the strike, CITU leader and Tamil Nadu State Transport Employees Federation president A Soundararajan insisted the strike will continue. “The strike will continue until our demands are met. We are ready to talk to the government, provided it is ready to accept our demands,” Soundararajan told Catch. He dismissed as “false” reports which have quoted him saying that the unions were ready to accept wage revision by the 2.44 multiplication factor, as proposed by the state government.         Earlier in the day Chief Minister E Palaniswami announced in the Tamil Nadu Assembly that the government will be releasing Rs 750 crore towards retirement benefits while urging the unions to call off the strike. ""I am happy to announce that the Amma (late chief minister J  ) government will provide Rs 750 crore towards pending (dues) for those who retired up to November 30, 2017. This will be provided before Pongal festival,"" he said.

545,Sulagna Sengupta,"The West Bengal government and the Centre are at loggerheads once again. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday shot off a letter to the West Bengal government claiming that they have reduced the fund for infrastructure development under the Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF) for Maoist affected areas. The letter sent by the MHA said that they have decided to give only Rs 1 crore per year to each Maoist affected district, instead of Rs 25 crore given earlier. This has incensed the state government, which has accused the Centre of acting unilaterally. West Bengal’s parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said, “We have decided to send a letter to the Centre urging them not to reduce the funds under BRGF in the Maoist affected districts. If the Centre does not reconsider then the state government will formulate a new policy for Maoist-affected districts.” A senior state government official further pointed out that the state government is supposed to provide a matching grant of 40% of whatever the Centre is providing. This will also undergo a reduction due to the Centre’s move.  “We have already sent utilisation certificates to the Centre for the projects that have been undertaken under BRGF in the Maoist affected districts and they have also given the receipt letter to us. The MHA’s sudden decision to reduce funds will definitely hamper development work in Maoist-affected areas,” said a senior official. There are five Maoist-affected districts in West Bengal - Purulia, Bankura, West Midnapore, Jhargram and Birbhum. The total number of such districts in the country is 106.

546,Sulagna Sengupta,"In a major development in the Darjeeling hills, fugitive Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leader Bimal Gurung has surfaced and expressed his willingness to have talks with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. On Thursday, Gurung said “I feel for the people of Gorkhaland and I think that I should speak to the state government and urge them to reconsider their stand on a separate state of Gorkhaland. I did not want to enter into a dialogue but for the sake of the people of the hills I feel that I should engage with the state government.” Gurung’s statement is a major victory for West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is said to have handled the crisis in the Darjeeling hills with an iron fist. Despite a shut down for many months, Banerjee refused to agree to the GJMM’s demands. On the other hand, Gurung failed to keep the movement united and faced opposition from within the Gorkha ranks, most prominently to Binoy Tamang. Banerjee exploited these differences and initiated a dialogue with Tamang, who was also made the chairperson of the Gorkha Territorial Administration (GTA). Political observers say that Gurung was left with no choice as he was losing ground in the hills. According to senior political analyst Amol Mukherjee, “We feel that Gurung wants to come back into the limelight as his influence was waning”.   Sources also revealed that another reason behind Gurung’s decision was the cold shoulder he received from the BJP. The party was afraid that if it seen as backing the Gorkha agitation, it would harm its prospects in rest of West Bengal. With Gurung now open to dialogue, it is now up to the West Bengal to decide on the modalities. Partha Chatterjee state parliamentary affairs minister said “We have not discussed this matter with the chief minister. She will take the final call”. On November 20, 2017 the Supreme Court restrained the West Bengal police from taking any “coercive action” against Gurung, who had gone underground with some of his aides.

547,Sebastian Sunny,"The long list of the star campaigners for by-elections to the Lok Sabha constituencies of Ajmer and Alwar and the Assembly seat of Mandalgarh, released by the BJP state headquarters on Thursday, has been cleared by none other than Amit Shah. The 40-strong list includes six union ministers, other than Rajnath Singh,  ,  , C.R.Chowdhury, P.P.Choudhary, Arjunlal Meghwal and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Of course, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is on the top of the heap leading the assorted group of home-grown leaders including 12 Ministers from Rajasthan, starting with the senior most, Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria and followed by Rajendra Singh Rathore, Arun Chaturvedi, Hemsingh Bhadana-- to suit all the important caste denominations in the constituencies of Ajmer and Alwar. Among the campaigners include Raje’s son and MP from Jhalawar, Dushyant Singh, his wife, Niharika Raje, party functionaries including the Rajasthan BJP president Ashok Parnami.  The BJP has fielded Ramswarup Lamba, the son of the   Sanwarlal Jat, for Ajmer. Its nominee for Alwar is Jaswant Yadav, a former MP and presently a Minister in the State Cabinet.  Both Jaswant Yadav and his Congress rival Karan Singh Yadav have represented Alwar seat in the past.  The Ajmer Lok Sabha seat is prestigious for both the Congress and the BJP as the seat was contested between  Pradesh Congress President Sachin Pilot and  Sanwarlal Jat, who was the chairman of the State Kisan Ayog at the time of his demise in August last year. Jat had won the seat in 2014 with a margin of 1.77 lakh votes. Though the Congress party has fielded a former MLA Raghu Sharma from the seat, the outcome is equally important for Pilot as the onus for a victory from the seat, represented by him in the past, is on him. Mandalgarh Assembly seat in Bhilwara district, which fell vacant after the death of BJP MLA,   Kumari, too is no less prestigious as it falls within the former Lok Sabha seat of senior Congress leader C.P. Joshi. The Congress has fielded Vivek Dhakkad from the seat while the BJP nominee is Shakti Singh Hada. “In a way this is conceding defeat on the part of the BJP,” argued Mahesh Joshi, former Congress MP  talking to Catch News. “Never before in the State’s electoral history in my memory a Prime Minister has participated in a by-election,” he pointed out. The BJP leaders acted shy of commenting on the star campaigners’ lineup. “We are winning the by-elections,” said Om Birla, BJP MP from Kota. He also pointed out that just because the names were there on the list it was not necessary that the Prime Minister took part in the campaign. The impressive lineup of the star campaigners is surely an indication of the importance the BJP gives to the by-elections in Rajasthan. It perhaps also betrays the unease in the party over the possible outcome of the by-polls as any adverse result would surely have an impact on the general mood in the state which will have its elections to the State Assembly in November-December.It is going to be a no-holds barred battle in Rajasthan! That the ruling BJP would be leaving no stone unturned for the ensuing battle at the husting in Rajasthan by-elections this month-end is now clear from the list of the star campaigners it has announced.

548,Ashwin Aghor,"As soon as he joined the Congress, political circles in Maharashtra were abuzz with speculation whether he will be contesting the Lok Sabha by-election from the seat. It will be a battle of prestige for BJP as well as NCP. If BJP loses the seat, especially to Patole, it would be a huge humiliation for the party as he had been openly critical of Prime Minister   and his policies. For the NCP, the seat is important as it happens to be the turf of senior leader Praful Patel. Both BJP and NCP have begun brainstorming on how to handle a possible bypoll, which has to be held within six months of the MP’s resignation. Patole resigned on 8 December, so the bypoll will have to be held by May. While Patole indicated that he could contest the by-election, he also downplayed the importance of the alliance for him. Nana Patole belongs to the agrarian OBC Kunbi community and the caste composition in the constituency works in his favour. If the Congress does field him, the NCP would see it as a direct infringement on its area, which could harm the prospects of an alliance between the two parties.   In either case, the NCP will soon have to open its cards on whether it wants to align with the Congress or not. When contacted Nana Patole said, “I will contest the by-election if asked by the party leadership.” When reminded of his earlier statement that he was interested in contesting the Assembly elections and the fact that Gondia-Bhandara is an NCP seat, Patole said cryptically, “The situation has changed now”. NCP leader Sunil Tatkare said, “Gondia-Bhandara is the constituency of our national leader Praful Patel. Congress cannot take a decision about it, circumventing us. They will have to keep us in loop.” Patole, however, is said to be of the belief that even Patel won’t be able to defeat him in the seat. Interestingly, Patole had declared earlier that he will contest against Patel if the latter contests from the seat with the BJP’s support. This is another possibility that is doing the rounds. “Given Pawar’s style of politics, one should not be surprised if this happens (Patel contesting with BJP’s support). Since it is matter of prestige for both BJP and NCP, they might join hands to defeat Patole at any cost. Either Patel will contest on BJP ticket or NCP will support the BJP candidate against Patole. BJP is most likely to field MLC Parinay Fuke who is also from the same area and same caste as Patole,” a BJP source said. Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Madhav Bhandari, however, claimed that Patole left the party and joined Congress because he had realised that he cannot win the elections. Rebel BJP MP from Gondia-Bhandara Nana Patole formally joined the Congress and met party President   on Thursday.

The movie is slated for release on January 25. Bhansali had filed a revision petition in the Rajasthan High Court at Jodhpur, requesting the FIR registered against him to be quashed. The FIR was lodged with Deedwana police station on February 17, 2017 under Sections 153A and 295A of IPC. In the FIR, complainant Virendra Singh and Nagpal Singh have alleged that the movie threatened to disrupt communal harmony and would hurt the religious sentiments of a community. In the review petition, it was pleaded that the movie had not even been released, so the complainants didn’t have any basis to determine if the claims made in the FIR were true. The single bench of Justice Sandeep Mehta stated that the FIR raised serious allegations against the petitioners and it could not be quashed without judging the merit of the complaint. The court has asked the producers to hold a film screening in the court before January 23. The lawyers told the court that they would consult with their client, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and appraise the court of the date when the screening could be held. The High Court had earlier ordered a stay on the FIR, directing the police not to take any further action in the matter. The court had also sought an explanation from the complainants. Notably, the Censor Board recently allowed the producers to release the movie after carrying out some changes. The movie’s name was also changed to Padmavat from Padmavati.

Gadkari, the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, was scheduled to come to Kolkata on January 16 and 17 for the Bengal Global Business Summit. Senior officials in West Bengal said that Gadkari had earlier confirmed his participation but soon after Friday’s clash, the state government received communication from the Union Minister’s office that he won’t be coming for the summit due to the “deteriorating law and order situation in the state”. The skirmish occurred around 11:15 AM, leaving 14 BJP supporters injured. As a result of the clash, the BJP also had to cut short their bike rally to mark the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda. The rally, named ‘Pratirodh Sankalp Abhigyan’, is also aimed at highlighting the alleged atrocities of the AITC government. On Friday morning tension spread at the BJP office near Central Avenue after BJP Yuva Morcha supporters began their bike rally carrying sharp-edged weapons. The Trinamool workers attacked them and tried to vandalise.  Workers of both the parties pelted stones at each other near Red Road in Kolkata. While Trinamool Congress claimed that BJP workers passed lewd comments to women in the street when they carried out their bike rally, BJP workers claimed that Trinamool workers attacked them first. There are also allegations that BJP workers tore posters of Swami Vivekananda that had been put up by the AITC. However, as a result of the clash, BJP supporters wore black masks and staged a dharna at Central Avenue, claiming that there is no democracy in West Bengal under the AITC. Dilip Ghosh, state BJP president, said “West Bengal ministers do not attend any meeting convened by the Central government and AITC has been paid back in their same coin. We have requested the Central government not to send ministers to any function organised by the West Bengal government”. Sources in state BJP said that Ghosh spoke to BJP president   soon after the incident and this eventually led to Gadkari backing out of the business summit. West Bengal parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said, “Kolkata Police had issued a notification on December 20 last year banning the display of weapons in rallies. But despite such orders, BJP workers took out a bike rally carrying sharp-edged weapons. They are trying to create disturbances in the state at a time when we are celebrating Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary.” Meanwhile the Calcutta High Court has told BJP Yuva Morcha to stop their bike rally for three days and conduct it from January 15 to 20. The High Court also instructed the police to monitor the rally and appoint a special officer to ensure that law and order is maintained. The West Bengal Police had earlier denied permission to BJP to hold the bike rally as it would coincide with the Gangasagar Mela – when lakhs of devotees visit Sagar Island in South 24 Parganas district on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. On Wednesday, the Calcutta High Court   allowed the BJP’s youth wing to go ahead with the rally, which was a blow for the AITC government. Political analysts, however, are of the opinion that the political clash has led to deterioration in Centre -state relations and harmed the image of West Bengal. According to senior political observer Amol Mukherjee, ""Political parties should deal with such issues politically. A political issue cannot be a reason for cancelling a pre-decided visit to a Summit which the West Bengal government has organised.""",2018-01-12,, Gadkari cancels Kolkata visit after BJP & Trinamool workers clash in Kolkata | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/gadkari-cancels-kolkata-visit-after-bjp-trinamool-workers-clash-in-kolkata-95139.html
552,Akash Bisht,"“What makes our people worried is the rise of the persistence of attacks on minorities as individuals or as institutions in some parts of our country. In Meghalaya, they have adopted a language that seeks to keep these incidents behind an assurance that nothing of the sort will happen in our state. This may be true. But we cannot ignore the persistence of anti-minority incidents. Our people will be the best judge,” Jala said. There is also a considerable fear amongst the Christians that if voted to power, BJP and RSS would push forward its Hindutva agenda and try to convert Christians into Hindus. Responding to this, the Archbishop pointed how the Church does not call Meghalaya a Christian State and will also not envisage a time where it becomes a Hindu state. “India, North East India and Meghalaya for that matter, are all marked by diversities. Any attempt to flatten out differences by a kind of imposition of one culture and one language theories is an act of violence against our own heritage. It only reminds one of a leader in Europe who tried to do that between the two World Wars – and with what consequences! The Church stands by the dignity of every single human person. It respects and protects the integrity of every culture,” he added. He, however, claimed that the Catholic Church remains completely apolitical and keeps out of party politics as a policy. He informed how few members of the Catholic community have joined the BJP and, probably, will stand as candidates in the upcoming polls.  “We do not interfere in their personal choice. It is up to our people to accept them or reject them. They are wise enough to make a choice,” he said. Another religious head of the Christians concurs with the Archbishop Jala and said that he shares the worries of many who interpret the attempt of the BJP to capture power in all the states in order to carry out their own agenda which are connected to a particular religious leaning. Articulating fears of his community, he said that BJP coming to power in most of the states could lead to an attempt being made to change the Constitution of India, by removing, for instance, the definition of our country as a “secular” entity. “There will certainly be a number of legislations and acts that will be passed which will greatly hamper our own freedom to work for the development of our people all over the country through our educational and social involvement. I do not see this kind of discourse coming up in the political discussions here. It looks as if BJP is harping only on attacks on religious persons and institutions and on the question of food habits of our people,” he said. He goes on to add that as Church leaders, they have the task of exhorting their people to exercise their franchise and keep reminding them that what we need are legislators who are concerned about the development of our people in a true and concrete way – and not only through speeches given during election campaigns. “We certainly will remind our people that we need legislators who will stand by the Constitution of India and ensure that all people, no matter what their race or creed or caste may be, have freedom to be what they are without any interference from any force, government or otherwise.” Prof K Debbarma, who heads the political science department at the North-Eastern Hill University in Shillong, is of the opinion that there is no denying the fact that BJP is trying to gain a foothold in the region and will succeed in winning some seats. According to Debbarma, the election campaign is at a very nascent stage and only when it gains momentum, can one predict who could emerge as favourite to win. “A lot would depend on what issues these parties raise and what their manifesto says. However, I do not think that BJP would be able to form government on its own. Though other regional parties have distanced themselves from BJP but the likelihood of them having a post poll understanding cannot be ruled out. Therefore, it remains crucial whether the people of the state see through this strategy of the BJP,” he pointed. He does add that no political party would cross the majority figure and the next government in the state would be a coalition government. However, he does not rule out the possibility of BJP forming the government with the help of allies like it did in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. “If you look at the number of Congress MLAs joining BJP, it shouldn't come as a surprise if BJP manages to win over independents and even Congress lawmakers once the results are announced. A repeat of Manipur and Goa can certainly happen in Meghalaya too,” Debbarma warned. However, BJP leaders remain confident of forming the government in the state with a “three-fourth majority”. A BJP leader from the North East said that the people of the state are fed up of the Congress government and are looking forward to change. On the question of Christians being wary of voting for BJP, he reminded how the party is in power in Nagaland and Manipur where Christians are in significant numbers. According to him, Church would not interfere in politics and certainly not side with the Congress. “Religion won't be a factor in these elections. It would be all about development. Christians are smart enough to know what BJP is fighting for. Moreover, regional parties like National People's Party (NPP), United Democratic Party, among others are part of BJP's North East Democratic Alliance and will help BJP form government in the state.” On the issue of Congress regaining power in the state, he just laughed it off and said how the Congress is imploding in the state with central leadership busy with other issues. “When their leader should be campaigning in Shillong, he is going to Bahrain. Moreover, did you notice how Congress leaders are joining BJP in droves. Such is the state of the party that it might run out of candidates even before the polls are announced,” he added. According to him, many other senior leaders are waiting to leave Congress to join BJP which he said offered them hope. Since December last year, seven Congress leaders, including senior leaders, have joined BJP and its allies bringing the party's tally down to 23 from 30. In fact, a day after five Congress MLAs resigned to join NDA partner NPP, party president   replaced state chief DD Lapang with Celstine Lyngdoh. However, that didn't improve Congress' position and senior leader and former health minister AL Hek joined BJP. Meanwhile, Congress remains confident of securing yet another term in Meghalaya and is banking on Christians to support the party. In fact, much of the party's campaign would be around BJP's divisive agenda and how minorities have come under attack ever since BJP came to power at the Center. It is also hoping that good governance will come to its rescue in the poll bound state. Christians hold the key to who rules Meghalaya and the odds seem to be stacked in Congress' favour. However, if the party repeats what happened in Manipur and Goa, it will be a reminder of how things have remained the same even with Rahul taking over the reins of the party.The   has successfully managed to make inroads into the Congress bastions in the North East, having won Assam and Manipur and conducting a political coup in Arunachal Pradesh. However, its juggernaut might hit a roadblock in poll-bound Meghalaya. Here the Christian community, which forms over 70% of the state’s population, is apprehensive about the BJP due to the attack on minorities in other parts of the country, in particular the attack on carol singers in Madhya Pradesh and the violence by cow vigilantes across India. Christians feel the BJP could try to saffronise the state by interfering in their food habits and pushing their Hindutva agenda. Dominic Jala, Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shillong, pointed how there is a growing sense of unease amongst the Christians regarding the BJP.",2018-01-13,, Why Christians’ fear of Hindutva could halt BJP’s juggernaut in Meghalaya  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-christians-fear-of-hindutva-could-halt-bjp-s-juggernaut-in-meghalaya-95241.html
553,Charu Kartikeya,"'Love jihad' is a concept invented by the Parivar's proponents to malign inter-faith marriages in the country and essentially further their Islamophobic politics. In pursuance of this ghost they have conjured, members of the Parivar do not care that they are assaulting the rule of law in the country, and on not one but multiple counts. In the latest incident, these men had reportedly approached an advocate in Baghpat to help one of them in getting married to a Hindu woman. The adult couple had fled Punjab and had gone to UP because they were finding it problematic to get married in Punjab, the woman's home-state.  Inter-faith couples in India often face such situations when their families do not support their relationship. In this case too, the girl's family was reportedly hostile to this relationship and filed an abduction case against the man with Punjab Police.  Keeping the case in mind, UP Police handed the couple over to Punjab Police, but only after failing in their duty to protect the couple from harm. A   circulating on social media clearly shows some men thrashing the Muslim men even as policemen are escorting them to a police vehicle.  Baghpat district president of Hindu Yuva Vahini, Nitin Chaudhary, and Baghpat city president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Vicky Chaudhary, reportedly admitted that they were indeed present at the spot. Nitin Chaudhary denied allegations of assault but asserted that the man who was thrashed was “trying to fool the girl by marrying her as a part of his 'love jihad' scheme and also had plans to sell the girl for Rs 50,000.”  One can understand that UP Police was duty-bound to hand the couple over to Punjab Police because of the abduction case but what doesn't make sense is the apparent pussy-footing in dealing with the lumpen elements who thrashed the Muslim men.  Baghpat SP said a complaint was taken from the couple and a case for assault was registered, but against unidentified persons. UP Police must first explain how is it that the men belonging to the said radical outfits succeeded in laying their hands on the men in police's presence?  Is it because none other than the present Chief Minister of the state,  , is himself a proponent of the concept of 'love jihad'? It is well-known that he has   the term repeatedly and has used it to cultivate his image as a Hindutva hardliner.  Edited by Joyjeet Das",2018-01-15,," In Adityanath's UP, can cops ever catch up with Hindu Yuva Vahini | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/in-adityanath-s-up-can-cops-ever-catch-up-with-hindu-yuva-vahini-95442.html
554,Rajeev Khanna,"One year after having been relegated to the third place in the Punjab Assembly polls, their worst ever performance, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) seems to have finally gathered its wits. The party has started making preparations for the Lok Sabha elections by launching blistering attacks on the Captain Amarinder Singh led Congress government. In a public outreach programme planned in the first week of February, the Akalis will be launching a 'Pol khol lehar' to “expose” the Congress government's alleged “fraud” on the farm loan waiver'. As a part of the programme, the SAD plans to hold rallies in all the 117 assembly constituencies in the state. The core committee of the party had a marathon meeting at the party headquarters in Chandigarh on Thursday evening following which the president Sukhbir Singh Badal pointed, “The total farm debt according to the Congress itself is Rs 90,000 crore and their total waiver scheme covers less than Rs 700 crore, that is less than one percent of the total burden.” The last fortnight has seen the Akalis launching a multi-pronged attack on the Amarinder government on various issues. Amarinder recently welcomed the Supreme Court decision to order fresh probe by a new SIT into 186 cases of the anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984 with the hope that justice would finally be meted out to the innocent victims. Sukhbir instantly dared him to quit the Congress party and move away from the Gandhis (Sonia and Rahul) to prove his sincerity on 1984 anti-Sikh massacre. ""It is the Congress and the Gandhis who have made him the leader of the Congress in Punjab Will he continue to stick to a gift from the killers of the Sikhs? I welcome his statement in this regard but my question to him now is that what are you still doing in a party guilty of murders of thousands of innocent Sikhs?"" asked Sukhbir. The Akalis who had been facing all round criticism on the issue of numerous instances of sacrilege of holy texts are now on the counter offensive. They are now demanding appointment of an inquiry commission headed by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court to go into the all incidents of sacrilege in Punjab both during their regime as well as the present one. They have been saying that they have no faith in the Justice Ranjit Singh (Retired) Commission set up by Amarinder government citing their close personal relations. Sukhbir said that the Punjabis have no faith in the fairness and professional objectivity of the chief minister's 'evening buddies like Justice Ranjit Singh (Retired) whose mission in life has been to hate and malign the SAD' ""Now the only pastime of such retired judges is to enjoy the splash and luxury of evening parties thrown by the chief minister. The social media is abuzz with the news and videos of these parties these days. What kind of commitment and honesty can one expect from such evening birds,?"" he said after the SAD meeting on Thursday. The farm loan waiver on which Amarinder rode to power is now turning out to be his biggest challenge. The Akalis are questioning why no policy is being framed to waive off complete loans of farm labourers and Dalits while asserting that the Congress should not discriminate against them. SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia recently said, “Even after ten months in power it has failed to come out with a policy to waive off their loans. Even Amarinder has given an empty assurance without any road map for waiving off the loans of farm labourers even as he has refused to waive off loans of the Dalit community.” “From a promised loan waiver of Rs 90,000 crore covering loans taken from cooperative and nationalised banks as well as private money lenders, the government has given a loan waiver of Rs 167 crore only and tried to befool the farming community that it has fulfilled its promise. Farm labourers and Dalits were kept out of even this puny waiver. More than 350 farmers have already committed suicide. This situation could worsen with no relief in sight for labourers and the Dalit community,” he added. The Akalis have been targeting Sadhu Singh Dharamsot who is the minister for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and backward castes. “Sadhu Singh Dharamsot also needs to resign immediately. Not only has he failed the Dalit community on this issue, he has failed to even ensure they get the social welfare benefits they were getting during SAD-BJP rule. All benefits including aata-daal scheme, old age pension, medical insurance to farmers and scholarship to SC students, have been discontinued,” Majithia charged. Over the last several months, the Akalis have been crying foul over their workers being targeted and framed in fake cases, something they had been accused of while they were in power. There are reports of violent clashes between the Congress supported elements and the Akali supporters almost on daily basis and the situation is the worst in the Majha areas from where many of these clashes go unreported. Just three days back it was the Congress leader Harinder Pal Singh Mann who courted controversy over in his speech at a rally in Sanaur area in Patiala where he allegedly instigated the Congress to 'sever' opponents if they indulge in any wrongdoing during the forthcoming Panchayat polls. “He later gave clarifications but the fact remains that his statements justify the Akali allegations,” points out an observer. Sukhbir has asked Amarinder to direct the state police to register a case against Mann. Telling Amarinder that Mann made the statement after telling people about his close relations with the chief minister, Sukhbir pointed that this amounts to misusing Amarinder's name. He said that this is not a lone case of Congress leaders using brute force to throttle the opposition. “Only few days back a young man Vinay Bajaj was gravely injured at Guruharsahai and when he approached the police to register a case against the son of Guruharsahai legislator Rana Gurmeet Sodhi, the police registered a case against unidentified persons. Last week an international Karate champion Kuldeep Kaur took her life after she could not win justice for her family despite an appeal to rural development and panchayat minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa. Earlier also there have been umpteen cases of Congress workers taking the law in their own hands and murdering and injuring Akali leaders and workers. All this is happening because you have refused to exercise the necessary political will and tell the police to register cases against all Congress leaders who are shattering the peace in Punjab,” he pointed.. Making a strong political statement, the Akalis have come out saying that the SAD would not allow Congress goons to indulge in goondaism in the forthcoming municipal corporation elections in Ludhiana. The SAD president has asked the party rank and file to form committees to ensure Congress goons did not capture booths as had happened during Patiala municipal corporation elections as well as other corporation and committee elections earlier. The party has decided to form a central office in Ludhiana for the corporation election that will be manned by former minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal and senior local leader Jeewan Dhawan. “The challenge before the Akalis at this point is to regain the faith of the public. The people are still angry with them but it remains to be seen till when this anger remains in the face of the floundering Congress government in the state. The Congress will have to go an extra mile to maintain its support base if it wants to do well in the parliamentary polls,” pointed an observer.",2018-01-12,," One year after poll loss, Akalis finally begin taking on Amarinder government  | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/one-year-after-poll-loss-akalis-finally-begin-taking-on-amarinder-government-95137.html
555,Rajeev Khanna,"At a meeting of the top leaders of Punjab held on  , AAP's state unit chief Bhagwant Mann announced that a drive would soon be launched to strengthen the party at the booth level. It was conveyed that Sisodia would soon undertake a series of one-to-one meetings with local leaders, right from MLAs to organisational functionaries.  Mann laid emphasis on strengthening the linkages that take a voter to the booth. He also underlined that the party would be launching a special drive to ensure that the morale of the party workers is restored, with local leaders who have deserted the party being brought back into the fold.  Leader of opposition in the state assembly Sukhpal Khaira said that pending work with regard to streamlining the organisational structure would be completed soon, and farmer-centric programmes would be initiated.  The party is now looking forward to a decent performance in the forthcoming Ludhiana Municipal Corporation polls, amid a fast-shrinking presence in the state.          In the recently concluded municipal corporation polls in Jalandhar, Amritsar, and Patiala, the party could field candidates in only 149 of 225 wards, failing to win even a single seat. The party fared poorly even in some of the wards that fell in the assembly constituencies being represented by AAP MLAs. The main opposition party giving such a dismal performance is a matter of major concern Ironically, it was the SAD-BJP combine that came up with a comparatively better performance, both in the local polls as well as the recent Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll.  In the local body polls, the ruling Congress emerged victorious in 20 of the 29 municipal councils and nagar panchayats, with its candidates winning in 267 of 414 wards. The SAD won in 37, BJP 15 and independents emerged victorious in 94 wards. AAP, meanwhile, could only manage a solitary victory in Bholath, Kapurthala, the constituency represented by Khaira. Prior to this AAP had come up with a pathetic performance in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll that was won by Sunil Jakhar of the Congress. The seat had fallen vacant following the death of actor-turned-politician   of the BJP. Jakhar had defeated BJP’s Swaran Salaria by a huge margin of 1.93 lakh votes. Jakhar polled 4,99,752 votes against Salaria's 3,06,533 votes. The AAP candidate, Major General (Retired) Suresh Khajuria, could poll only 23,579 votes and lost his deposit. In the 2014 polls, AAP candidate Sucha Singh Chhotepur had got around 1.80 lakh votes. This huge drop in votes was received as a big embarrassment for the party.  Amid such a scenario, the party needs to put its house in order at the earliest. It needs to boost the morale of its cadres and take up some people-centric campaigns at the earliest if it wants to come up with a decent showing in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. With the people still angry with the SAD-BJP combine, and their disillusionment growing with the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress regime, there is still a window of opportunity available for the party. How best it can use this opportunity remains to be seen.Precisely one year ago, the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) was threatening to walk away with electoral laurels in the Punjab Assembly polls. However, the tide turned in favour of the Congress, and AAP came a distant second in the end. Since then, internal rivalries, bickering, and the departure of workers to rival political camps has seen the party on a downhill slide. One it has failed to halt. Initially, AAP's leadership from Delhi had decided to step into the background after allegations that the party's Punjab leadership was being sidelined had come up prior to the assembly polls last year. But last month, the leadership in Delhi decided to take charge of matters once again, appointing Delhi's deputy chief minister   as the state in-charge.     With the Lok Sabha polls approaching fast, Sisodia faces an uphill task when it comes to improving or repeating the 2014 performance in Punjab, where the party had won four of the 13 seats. The party is looking to get its affairs in order once again in the state, where there is still enough space for a third alternative to the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-  (BJP) combine.",2018-01-15,, A state of decline: Can Manish Sisodia stem AAP's slide into irrelevance in Punjab | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/a-state-of-decline-can-manish-sisodia-stem-aap-s-slide-into-irrelevance-in-punjab-95422.html
556,Nishant  Chhabra,"PM Modi will on Tuesday launch what is being described as ""work commencement"" for one of the country's most modern refineries in Rajasthan's Barmer district -- almost five years after Sonia Gandhi, then the Congress president had laid its foundation stone. It's is now for the second time when a big event will be held for the same project. Modi is also scheduled to address a public gathering during the programme.  The function will be held at 12:30 pm in Pachpadra town, which is about 450 km from state capital Jaipur, where the refinery is to come up. The Rs 7 billion project, when completed in the estimated time of four years, will provide direct and indirect employment to 10,000 persons.  The 9 MMTPA (million metric tonnes per annum) refinery, a joint venture between Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and the Rajasthan government, is the state's first. Its products will conform to BS-VI emission norms. The  Barmer refinery has been the subject of a political slugfest between the Congress and Rajasthan's ruling BJP. Former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot recently wrote to the Prime Minister questioning why the refinery's foundation stone was being laid again when this was done way back in 2013.  Soon after this, the invitation cards distributed for the event used the expression ""Work Commencement Function"" instead of the ""foundation stone laying function"". Gehlot was quick to latch onto this, describing it as a face-saving move by the  Vasundhara Raje government in the State. As per the schedule, the refinery is slated to be completed by 2022-23 and would be producing the highest grade BS-VI fuel. It would utilize crude oil from not just the nearby Barmer fields, but also from other parts of the country and even abroad transported via pipelines.  (With Agency Inputs)Even before commencing operations, the Barmer refinery in Rajasthan has earned a distinction of sorts. The proposed Rs 43,129 crore project will now have two foundation stones — the first was laid by Congress leader   on September 22, 2013, and the second, slated to be laid by Prime Minister   on Tuesday, January 16. ",2018-01-15,, PM Modi in Barmer tomorrow; an act of adding political fuel? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/pm-modi-in-barmer-tomorrow-an-act-of-adding-political-fuel-95440.html

558,Anurag Dey,"The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has decided to intensify its gharwapsi campaign, alleging that there has been a rise in forcible conversions across India. It wants to convert non-Hindus to Hinduism as they believe they were originally Hindus.   The VHP at its recently concluded three day international conference in Odisha, adopted a resolution condemning “rampant conversion of Hindus under compulsion, deception and intimidation” across the country, particularly in Odisha.   The resolution said that “not only Hindus are being converted under compulsion, enticed deceived and intimidated, also their land has been subjugated for years to create an atmosphere of retribution chaos and terror”.      The right wing Hindu organisation claims that Christian missionaries and Muslim organisations were pumping money and adopting various means to lure or compel Hindus to convert.   VHP joint secretary general Surendra Kumar Jain claimed forcible conversion will soon lead to tribals losing their cultural identity.   “Christian missionaries are pumping in money across the country with the sole aim of conversion. Such is the extent of conversion that tribals are on the verge of losing their ethnic and cultural identity,” said Jain.   VHP spokesperson Vinod Bansal said ghar wapsi was the only way to prevent any “imbalance” in India’s demographic profile.       “Population jihad and ‘love jihad’ are two major issues faced by the country. Today Jihadi elements have spread their tentacles across the country and unless tackled immediately Hindu existence itself will be in jeopardy. “As per Pew Research, the Muslim population is expanding at a faster rate than the Hindu population and by 2050, India will be home to largest Muslim population in the world. “But going by the way Hindus are being converted across the country, that will happen much sooner than 2050,” alleged Bansal. While the gharwapsi campaign will be intensified across the country, major focus will be on non-BJP ruled states like West Bengal, Kerala and Odisha.   “Jihadis are on the rise in states like Bengal and Kerala, thanks to the politics pursued by the ruling parties. Hindus in Bengal are now facing persecution much like they face in Pakistan or Bangladesh. In Kerala, love jihad is so rampant that even the court has to take cognisance,” said Bansal.       Under the campaign VHP activists will identify regions where Hindus have been forcibly converted and then arrange for their reconversion.   “The campaign entails educating Hindus about the perils of love jihad. How innocent girls are being preyed upon and turned into sex slaves for the jihadis. Educating them about the various means adopted by them including lure of job and education, to convert them,” said Bansal.    The VHP has also demanded the Odisha government to make public the findings of the Naidu Commission that probed the 2008 communal riot in Odisha's Kandhamal district.   The Justice A S Naidu headed panel was set up after the ethno-communal riots broke out following the murder of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four of his associates at his Ashram in August 2008.   Alleging Christian missionaries were behind the murder with tacit support from the state government, the VHP demanded the commission report be made public.  “Behind this merciless killing, the hands of the state government cannot be ignored.

559,Rajeev Khanna,"The top leadership of the   (BJP) has managed to diffuse the crisis that had hit the party's government in Gujarat recently by managing to pacify the sulking deputy chief minister Nitin Patel who was making rebellious noises over portfolio allocation. But within a fortnight of the party being voted back to power, BJP’s stability has come into question. The party stands exposed with regards to its steadiness and resembles a termite infested trunk of a banyan tree. In the entire episode that unfolded in the last few days of 2017, chief minister Vijay Rupani stands cornered as a weak leader in the party as well in the state giving further credence to the view that he is 'a remote controlled puppet of the BJP's national president  '. After all, the chief minister must have a say in allocation of responsibilities to his team members. On the other side, the developments also send out a signal on how weak-kneed the BJP has become in the face of Patidars in the state. The crisis stood averted on Sunday when Nitin Patel got the coveted finance department along with five other portfolios and went on to take charge at the Sachivalaya in Gandhinagar. He had refused to come to office after taking oath on December 28 showing his unhappiness at being divested of finance and urban development portfolios that were with him in the last government led by Rupani. The crisis reportedly got over when Amit Shah called Nitin Patel assuring him of portfolios in line with his demand that went with his respect intact and safeguarded his Number Two position in the government. He eventually got the finance portfolio that had earlier been given to Saurabh Patel who now has only one portfolio of energy with him. The sequence of events has led to the observers and analysts putting things in different perspective. There is a widespread view that the whole episode has portrayed Rupani as a weakling who has no or very little say in the running of his government. The second most interesting observation is on how weak the BJP stands in the state in the face of the powerful Patidar lobby in the state. “Just look at the hollowness of everything. Nitin Patel is no Shankersinh Vaghela who can topple a government like the latter did in 1995. He has no following among the party MLAs. Not a single party member came out in open support of him when he sat sulking at his home. All that came out was that a meeting was held at the house of party leader Babu Jamuna Patel, where Cabinet ministers Bhupendrasinh Chudasma, Kaushik Patel and Pradipsinh Jadeja met Nitin Patel. Chudasma came out to announce that the matter was resolved and next day Nitin Patel gets finance and is happy. There are no details available of what transpired at the meeting,” points out a political observer based in Ahmedabad. Then there is also a line of thought that the whole 'tamasha' was a creation of the BJP to weigh how much anger still remains among the Patidars for the party. “The manner in which a section of the Patidars affiliated to the Sardar Patel Group went to the extent of calling for a Mehasana Bandh shows this. Then there was the whole drama of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leader   asking Nitin Patel to join the Congress which initiated a big debate among various sections on whether the Congress should accept Nitin Patel or not and how it would benefit the BJP in the long run. This added to the chaos and fluidity of the situation,” the observer added. He pointed that the manner in which things have unfolded sends out a signal that the Patidars just have to make a little noise to make the BJP deliver what they want. At the same it also remains to be seen how much interest and time Prime Minister   and Amit Shah have reserved for Gujarat in the coming days with the assembly polls in Karnataka and some other states approaching along with the next Lok Sabha polls. “Modi wanted to retain Gujarat at all costs before the next Lok Sabha polls which he has managed to do somehow. Had the BJP lost Gujarat he would have stood extremely weakened. Now the job is to consolidate support for the Lok Sabha polls while the nitty-gritty of Gujarat affairs can be kept on the back burner for now,” he added. But another senior political analyst Harish Gurjar who is based in Surat has a different take on the scenario. “The whole issue revolving around Nitin Patel has come as a blow to the BJP. I believe that the BJP had planned to sideline the Patidars just like the Muslims after it won the polls this time. It gave Nitin the post of the deputy chief minister while keeping key portfolios away from him as per the design. But it had to succumb to the circumstances as Patidar groups sent the signal of rallying behind Nitin Patel,” he said. He further pointed, “Come to think of it that whenever the government had to face the Patidars in the last two years it was always fielding Nitin Patel. He was the one also facing the press on Patidar issues. Then he managed to win his seat that everyone including a large number of those in the BJP had given up as lost. He was named the deputy chief minister and the party wanted to use him as a puppet. Saurabh Patel came back into the cabinet not because of his virtue of being a Patel but because of his Modi connection. The best thing for the party would have been to give Nitin important portfolios going by his experience in the first place. That would also have saved the embarrassment of Rupani being seen as a remote controlled chief minister of Amit Shah.” The storm might have passed over for now but the BJP's citadel of Gujarat is set to remain volatile in the days to come.",2018-01-02,, How the Nitin Patel episode exposed BJP’s weakness in Gujarat | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/how-the-nitin-patel-episode-exposed-bjp-s-weakness-in-gujarat-94092.html
560,S Murari,"If the political situation in the state remains stable, then the next polls would be in 2021. But the present EPS government is already in the minority, and is only clinging to power by virtue of Prime Minister   who needs time to get the BJP ready to do battle in the southern state. With the political future of Tamil Nadu balancing on a knife edge, what will happen to Rajini's plans if elections come sooner than he expects? Local body elections in Tamil Nadu are long overdue, and the issue is currently before the courts. Despite no time frame as to when they will be held, Rajini has already stated that his party will not contest the local body elections because of a paucity of time. In fact, he said he will only take a call on the 2019 Lok Sabha polls closer to the actual event. His decision to bypass the local body polls, which would directly connect the party with the people at the grassroots level, seems like an opportunity missed. Instead, Rajini has asked supporters to form party units at the village level. Till the elections, these units will not talk politics, but rather concentrate on building up grassroots-level support for the party. The most welcome feature of Rajini's entry into politics is that he is not after fame or fortune, something he has already attained in the film world. If he sticks to that promise, it may see him function as a party boss, like  , and pick the right candidates, not necessarily from among his fans. By saying he is entering politics to stem the rot in the system, something that was evident in the bitter power struggle in the AIAMDK after the passing of late CM J Jayalalitha, Rajini seems poised to campaign on a plank of clean governance. Rajini has not spelled out how he plans to fund the party. His rival Kamal Haasan, who is also planning to enter politics, has said he will raise funds from the people as   leader   has done. Kamal is set to launch his Whistler Blower App, while Rajini says his fans will serve as watchdogs of the people against corruption. However, in a state like Tamil Nadu, money power in politics is such a big factor that several Election Commissioners like T S Krishnamoorthi have said they have not seen such note-for-vote electioneering even in Bihar. In fact, the recently concluded RK Nagar by-election once again showed the Election Commission’s failure to stop the   and the TTV Dinakaran-led breakaway faction from bribing voters. Rajini has never spent any money for any public cause. He need not bribe voters. But to run a party costs crores of rupees. Is he ready to spend out of his own pocket? Who is going to bankroll him? Will he helped by the BJP? While he has said that he would shun politics based on caste or religion, Rajini has stated that he will practice “spiritual politics”. Given that he has met with PM Modi on multiple occasions, it remains to be seen whether his “spiritual politics” mean that he will function as a satellite of the BJP. Interestingly, while his credo is “Do good, be good”, none of this really sheds any light on what the party's policies will be. In the past, Rajini has refrained from taking a clear stance on issues vital to Tamil Nadu’s interests like the Cauvery situation. When the entire Tamil film fraternity went on a fast in 2003 to demand Karnataka release water to Tamil Nadu as per the tribunal’s order, Rajini did not join. Instead, He went on a separate fast, saying the only solution was interlinking of rivers, and pledged Rs one crore if the project was launched. Given that the project was never launched as it needs the consent of both the concerned states, this pledge remains a token gesture. If they agree on water sharing, there may not be any need for inter-linking either. In fact, Rajini announced that the party's policies and programmes will be announced only at the time of formally launching the party. What exactly these will be is vital to the success of the party. Tamil Nadu has a history of screen idols-turned-politicians. However, AIADMK founder and matinee idol MGR didn't just succeed at politics overnight. He became a political figurehead because he lived up to the carefully constructed image created on screen as pro-poor by splurging money on charity. Beside this, MGR had a long association with the DMK, even doing field work for the party, and serving as an MLC and MLA, before forming the AIADMK in 1973. His party only came to power a further four years later in 1977. Likewise, his protege,  , entered politics as AIADMK propaganda secretary in 1983, and only came to power in 1991 after a bitter struggle to gain control of a party that split after MGR’s passing in 1987. Since then, her stormy political career was marked by ups and downs. However, her fighting spirit and political acumen allowed her to stay in power. Now 68, and at the fag end of his cinema career, Rajini has finally chosen to serve the people. However, he is not in the pink of health nor does he have the political pedigree of MGR or Jayalalithaa. Will he have the stamina to tour the state and the ability to connect with the people like MGR and Jayalalithaa did? There also remain question marks about his identity. True, the people have accepted whoever has made Tamil Nadu their home, as they did with MGR and Jayalalithaa.. Millions of his fans see Rajini as a Tamil by adoption and not as a Kannadiga. However, fringe groups have already started a campaign demanding that Tamil Nadu should be ruled by only Tamils, saying that nowhere else in the country can you see a non-native becoming Chief Minister. This, though, may not affect Rajini, since he has said he has no desire to become Chief Minister. After 50 years of rule by Dravidian parties, people, especially the educated middle class, are looking for a change. If Rajini promises an alternative to the Kazhagams in alliance with the BJP, he can still make a mark. More so if Assembly elections are held along with the next Lok Sabha polls in 2019, since the people generally vote for an alliance led by a national party.After a week-long wait, Tamil film star   announced on New Year's Eve that he plans to float a political party and contest the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. However, while the superstar has finally decided to take the political plunge, his announcement has raised more questions than it has provided answers. In his announcement, Rajini said his party will be in place well before the next Assembly elections, and that it will contest all 234 seats in Tamil Nadu. However, what is still unclear is whether this means that he is going to go it alone. More importantly, how does he intend to fund this party, what sort of party does he intend to run, and will he actually manage to transmute his film stardom into political success?",2018-01-02,," Rajinikanth takes the plunge, but what will his political avatar look like? | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/rajinikanth-takes-the-plunge-but-what-will-his-political-avatar-look-like-94087.html
561,Riyaz Wani,"With a Kalashnikov leaning against the wall on either side of him and one laid out in front of him, 16-year-old Fardeen Ahmad Khanday speaks with poise and persuasion about the need for Kashmiri youth to wage jihad in a video he made shortly before attacking a security encampment at Lethpora in South Kashmir on New Year’s eve.  Five CRPF personnel were killed besides the three fidayeen, two of them Kashmiris. Khanday was one of them. Another was Manzoor Ahmad Baba. They belonged to the Jaish-e-Mohammad group.   This is the first time that Kashmiri militants have been a part of the Fidayeen attack, otherwise a preserve of the foreigners. The only earlier instance of a Kashmiri carrying out a suicide attack was when a Class 12 student Afaq Shah blew himself up outside the gate of Srinagar-based 15 Corps in 2000.  “By the time my message reaches you, I would have become the guest of the God’s heaven, God willing,” says Khanday who ironically is the son of a constable in J&K Police.  “O, youth of Kashmir, listen to the call of mujahideen and obey. Please remember, youth give their lives for the life of their nation. Azadi is not granted without sacrifices. Only the hands splattered with blood can knock on the gates of Azadi”.  This is the first video of its nature in Kashmir. In recent years, the militants have used social media videos to glamourise militancy and draw more youth to their ranks, but never before have they issued a video of a militant about to carry out an attack on the security forces.   This makes Lethpora attack an ominously important one. It signals the arrival of Kashmiri fidayeen on the scene. And it also shows their willingness to publicise their imminent death to exhort and inspire more youth to join jihad.    What is more, Khanday’s video also underlines a deeper ideological commitment among sections of the militants to the separatist cause. In 7.5 minutes of speech, Khanday speaks extempore and fluently articulates Jaish’s jihadi narrative, even enumerating the major strikes carried out by the outfit - from Afaq’s suicide mission to Pathankot air base attack to J&K Police lines early this year and warning more of them in future.  “God willing, Jaish militants will defeat India in Kashmir,” he says in the video.     The development, as a result, has been a cause of deep worry among the security establishment. Just when they were playing up the killing of around 218 militants during 2017 – the highest in the past seven years - and the consequent setback to militancy, Jaish-led fidayeen attack on the eve of the new year has made the situation look worse.  “We are told that the killings of a record number of militants has improved the situation. But Lethpora attack shows nothing like that has happened,” says political analyst Gowhar Geelani. “In fact, the situation now looks more fragile than anytime. Despite killings, militants retain the capability to strike anytime and anywhere”.  Similarly, an editorial in a local daily also rubbed it in: “A Fidayeen attack on the eve of the new year has once again underscored the grim security scenario unfolding in Kashmir. Despite killing around 2020 militants in 2017, the militancy seems to have grown only deadlier in Kashmir”. However, security experts are playing down the attack. “It is very difficult to prevent a fidayeen attack. A small number of brainwashed militants can carry it out. Killings of more militants, on the contrary, thins out their presence on the ground and releases more space for peace and the mainstream political activity. This is what has started happening in parts of South Kashmir,” said a senior police officer not wishing to be named as he was not authorised to speak to press. “But we expect things to change for the better this year”.  The officer said that the Lethpora fidayeen attack hasn’t been followed by protests and stone throwing in the adjacent villages. “So, this is one positive take-away from the attack,” the officer said. “Another big positive, and it is about the last year, is that 65 militants returned to their families after persuasion by J&K Police”.  However, protests did erupt at Drubgam, Pulwama during the funeral of the militant Manzoor Ahmad Baba. One protester reportedly received a bullet in the face.    But Kashmiri militants becoming a part of the attack is a development that the security agencies won’t find easy to shrug off. “Yes, this is something that has happened for the first time.  And we can’t ignore it,” said the police officer. In Valley, the participation of the local militants in Fidayeen attacks is seen as an inflection point for the militancy. It has for once removed the critical difference between the Kashmiri militants and their local counterparts. The situation, if it continues in this direction, has the potential to make things worse.

In fact, so closely is he associated with his beard that the CBI once alleged that D.G. Vanzara, then the Gujarat DIG, was referring to Modi when he spoke of a ' ' while discussing the Ishrat Jahan encounter. Alas, the PM of the country and leader of Saini's party must now be exiled from the country. After all, in the words of Saini, “ ,” which many economists believe is a fair assessment if Saini is referring to demonetisation and a poorly implemented GST law. Luckily for PM Modi, he wont be lonely in exile. In fact, his right-hand man,  , will be right there with him as he watches the sun set over Karachi's skyline. Shah, the ' ' to Modi's ' ', is as synonymous with beards as he is with orchestrating communally charged electoral campaigns. Unfortunately for Shah, all his work to establish Ram Rajya has finally come to naught, with his trademark beard his ultimate undoing. Without Shah, the UP Assembly election results that brought Saini to power would probably not happen again. Luckily, Saini is a true Hindu patriot and understands that personal sacrifice is important when it comes to working to create a Hindu rashtra. The second Sarsangchalak (supreme leader) of the   (RSS), BJP's ideological mentor, Golwalkar led the RSS for 30 years. His leadership saw the RSS grow from 1,00,000 to over 10,00,000, and spread across India and the globe. While he is venerated by the BJP and the Sangh Parivar, Golwalkar, by Saini's logic, should have been banished to Pakistan at the time of Partition. The only group of people more synonymous with beards than Muslims are Hindu godmen. From Sri Sri Ravishankar of Yamuna flood plain fame, to Baba Ramdev and Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, Hindu godmen without their beards would be as unrecognisable as the BJP without communal politics. Now, despite all three men being big fans of the ruling regime, they should start looking for accommodation in foreign lands.  Given their lucrative spiritual set-ups, we understand what Saini meant when he said, ""  (The longer one’s beard, the more the amount on his cheque). While the Congress came up short in the recently concluded Gujarat elections, Rahul Gandhi enjoyed a personal revival. However, during the course of the campaign, the Gandhi scion was criticised by the BJP for not being Hindu.  Luckily for Gandhi, though, Saini's biggest qualification for Hindu identity is the absence of a beard. With Gandhi ditching his unkempt beard for a clean shaven look, he can now finally win over the Hindu right and defeat the BJP in 2019.Even as victims of the Muzaffarnagar riots still await justice and restitution, Vikram Saini, the   legislator from Muzaffarnagar's Khatauli, celebrated the new year with a thinly veiled attacks on India's Muslim community.

The Bandh was successful and was conducted peacefully,"" he said. He added that they are withdrawing the Bandh with the assurance that Bhide and Ekbote will be arrested.

Joining the political slugfest over the issue, the RSS pointed fingers at Gujarat MLA and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani and Jawaharlal Nehru University student leader Umar Khalid of making provocative speeches that fanned the Bhima-Koregaon violence. However, two pro-RSS leaders Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote are accused of being behind the violence. Congress president   took to Twitter to blame the BJP and its ideological mentor RSS. A central pillar of the RSS/BJP’s fascist vision for India is that Dalits should remain at the bottom of Indian society. Una, Rohith Vemula and now Bhima-Koregaon are potent symbols of the resistance.    Raising the issue in Parliament, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Malikarjun Kharge alleged the attack to be a handiwork of the RSS and called for a judicial probe. He also ridiculed Prime Minister   for his silence on such issues.  The RSS which is holding a two-day meeting of its functionaries in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain, dismissed Congress’ charges.  “There is no question of the Sangh doing this… rather it is the Sangh which has been making efforts to unite the society. Congress has a habit of blaming the Sangh for anything and everything, so it is nothing new,” said RSS spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya. “But there are some who pursue the politics of division. Employing various means they endeavor to break the society. Listen to the speeches made by those who chant Bharat tere tukde honge,” he said in a reference to Khalid and Mevani who had attended an event to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle of Bhima-Koregaon, in Pune on  . “Rajiv Malhotra in his book 'Breaking India' has detailed about such anti-national elements.

565,Rajeev Khanna,"Defeated in the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections, it is time for the Congress to chalk out its future course. And the clamour in the Congress’ rank and file is that the party must go in for a generational change. Whether the party high command is farsighted enough to see this or not, it is high time that the affairs of the party are handed over to a youthful team. “The era of the leaders like Virbhadra Singh and Vidya Stokes who are in their eighties is over. The party has to go into the hands of the youngsters if it is to move ahead with changing times,” pointed out a political observer. “It is very simple to understand the need for a young leadership. The youngsters in a family interact very little with their grand and great grandparents. They are more comfortable interacting with their parents or elder siblings. The same holds true for a party. In a state where 60 per cent of voters are in the age group of 18 to 45 years, the party leadership can at the most be in the fifties. The voters want accessibility now and the party high command has to understand this,” says a Congress leader. He further pointed out that the   (BJP) appointing a young chief minister in Jai Ram Thakur and his Cabinet also being relatively younger, it becomes all the more important for the Congress to put forward a youthful profile. “We have to now look for a revival starting 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Out decline started with the 2014 Lok Sabha elections that culminated in the recent assembly polls. By infusing fresh blood into the leadership slots and also into the organisation we have to start with improving our tally in the next Lok Sabha elections,” the leader added. The Congress workers also feel that in the hanging times there is no scope left for factionalism in the party. The party president   has to ensure that the leadership remains united and the hierarchy is not challenged on the ground. All the eyes are now on the election of the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader who will be donning the cap of the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the state Assembly. The names doing the rounds are that of state unit chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, Mukesh Agnihotri, Ram Lal Thakur, Asha Kumari and Harshvardhan Chauhan. Sources say that the former chief minister Virbhadra Singh is also eying the slot. A meeting to elect the CLP leader is slated to be held on Thursday with the state in-charge   Shinde as the observer. He will be assisted by former Maharashtra minister Balasaheb Thorat. Going by the Congress culture, it is likely that the high command be asked to nominate the person for the post. In that case it remains to be seen which way the high command goes. “It is expected that the new CLP leader will be from among the younger lot. This will send a very positive message among the workers and the supporters,” said a Congress functionary. Another thing that the Congress needs to do is to strengthen its organisation. “Having come up from the ranks Sukhu has done quite a lot on this front. This needs to be taken further now as a part of the party's long term strategy. It would be much better if the party starts giving more and more responsibilities and tickets to contest various polls to people who rise through the party organisations like the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Youth Congress and Sewa Dal,” points out an observer based in Shimla. The grand old party's leaders in the hill state also need to shed the elitist image that they have acquired over the years. “Gone are the days when victory by default was assured. The time has come that the party leaders have maximum connect with the masses and are more grounded. Look at the way people stood by the lady constable who had slapped back senior party leader Asha Kumari after she was assaulted by the latter for not being allowed entry to the venue in Shimla where Rahul Gandhi had come to evaluate the party's defeat in the recent polls. Rahul reportedly chided his party leader for her act also gave a positive message,” said an observer in Shimla. The observer further pointed, “The Congress workers on the ground are also upset in which Rahul failed to even acknowledge their presence at the venue. He could have come out and at least waved at them. Compare this with Prime Minister   who knows the tricks very well. He stopped outside the Indian Coffee House to have a cup of coffee knowing this would make news. He kept waving and even chatted with a few people. The Congress has lots to learn from him.” During his recent visit Rahul spelt out his priorities saying that only those leaders who enjoyed a clean image and had connect with the masses would be given eminence in the party. “Indiscipline will not be tolerated and all dedicated and sincere party workers will be given respect and due recognition,” he reportedly said in his address. He said the party leaders and those in the government had become arrogant and lost connect with the masses, and that had led to the defeat of the party. The party president also said the Congress would provide all possible opportunities to young and energetic leaders, who come forward and serve the party. How much of this is implemented in letter and spirit remains to be seen. Several Congress candidates who had lost in the recent polls complained to him that senior party leaders had backed Congress rebels against the official party candidates. The Congress in Himachal is down but not out. All its leaders need at this point is to pull up their socks and start preparing for the 2019 parliamentary poll battle. They will have to be more proactive and receptive to the people's aspirations given the fact that they will be up against an upbeat team of the BJP with a person like Jai Ram Thakur who has a strong RSS grooming at the top of the government.  ",2018-01-03,, Beyond Virbhadra: Congress must usher in a generational change in Himachal Pradesh | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/beyond-virbhadra-congress-must-usher-in-a-generational-change-in-himachal-pradesh-94177.html
566,Charu Kartikeya,"To get a sense of how the scheme is actually working on the ground,   spoke to Congress MLA Jitu Patwari who was at the forefront of the Mandsaur agitation. Patwari dismissed the scheme altogether, labelling it as a tool devised by the government to distract people. He said there was no way to calculate the differential price when there was no scientific system in place to arrive at the right price in the first place. He said that the money that the state government presently gives to farmers under this scheme is a pittance. Patwari's demand was that the government should simply declare double the expenditure incurred by farmers as the MSP and ensure that the farmer gets that price. Several agricultural experts are of the opinion that the MP scheme has not turned out to be ineffective. A well-known commentator on agricultural policy Devinder Sharma told   that deficiency payment models in agriculture exist all over the world, but the problem with the scheme in MP is that traders have led to a cartelisation of prices there. He explained that the model price that the government arrives at after looking at the average of prices prevalent in mandis is actually a distress price and not the ideal rate that the farmer should be getting. Indeed, it is usually lower than the MSP itself so what the farmer ends up getting is a price lower than the MSP. Sharma recommended that for this scheme to actually benefit farmers, MSP should be declared as the model price so that the farmer gets at least the MSP. Farm activist Ramandeep Singh Mann posted on Twitter examples of what Sharma was pointing out. In October, Mann said, MP government fixed Rs 3,000 per quintal as the 'model price' for Urad, even as its MSP was Rs 5,400. As a result, what the farmer ended up getting even after the State's intervention was Rs 2,400 less than MSP. Singh pointed out that similar was the case with soya-bean, whose model price was set at Rs 2,580 per quintal against MSP of Rs 3,050. Assuming that the Modi-government succeeds in preventing cartelisation of prices if it launched this scheme at the national level, what it will end up guaranteeing is only the MSP. This will mean non-fulfilment of the promise made by BJP in Lok Sabha polls 2014, that it will provide farmers a remuneration amounting to 50% over the cost of production. This was in keeping with the Swaminathan Commission's recommendations. Farmers and groups working for their rights have been saying for a long time that this is the bare minimum that they must get, underlining that even that will not make agriculture profitable for farmers. What farmers have needed for a long time is a slew of reforms, something that the Modi government has failed to initiate in over three years. The government is on its last lap now, as the Union Budget 2018-19 will be its last full-fledged budget. It is next to impossible for the government to work up miracles now that will turn around the fortunes of farmers overnight. It is possibly because of this realisation that the government appears to be investing its energy in stunts like this scheme.The scheme that the Centre is reportedly banking upon to salvage its falling fortunes among farmers might turn out to be a dampener. It is already in operation in Madhya Pradesh and has not been getting rave reviews. Media reports are claiming that the Union government may be seeking inspiration from the Madhya Pradesh government's Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana, which was launched after the farmers' agitation in Mandsaur in June 2017. It is essentially a differential pricing scheme in which the state government arrives at a median price and pays the differential to those farmers who were forced to sell at a price lower than that. The   said the contours of the scheme were discussed at a meeting between MP Chief Minister   and Prime Minister   recently. NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand has also reportedly visited the state on multiple occasions to examine the scheme. “The problem of agricultural commodity prices slipping below the MSP is a serious problem, and we need to find a solution. It could be a workable model. I will recommend it to states and the Centre for consideration,” Chand has said.",2018-01-05,, Can Madhya Pradesh's scheme for farmers save BJP from their ire? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/can-madhya-pradesh-s-scheme-for-farmers-save-bjp-from-their-ire-94252.html
567,Sulagna Sengupta,"In an effort to attract overseas investment Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will be visiting China in the first week of June this year. This will be Mamata's second visit to China.  The Chinese Consul General based in Kolkata, Ma Zhanwu, has invited Mamata to visit the country to assess the avenues for Bengal–China partnership. Sources in the chief minister’s office (CMO) said that the Chinese Consul General had sent a letter to the chief minister on 11 December inviting her to visit China to have discussions on possible investments in various sectors including agriculture, manufacturing and IT. The chief minister has already agreed to the proposal and she is going to be visiting China in the first week of June, the CMO informed. A senior official of the state government said a delegation of few city-based industrialists will also accompany the chief minister. While there is no official blueprint of what Mamata is going to do there yet, but it is expected that she will be discussing investments and talking to industrialists. In the 2017 Bengal Global Business Summit, China’s TEB Technologies said that they wanted to invest Rs 27,200 crore, the highest proposed foreign investment offered by any country to West Bengal, in the state. Mamata will be speaking to the TEB officials on this trip and urge them to speed up their processes. TEB's technology is used to manufacture MRTS rakes. Banerjee has plans of visiting Jiangsu and Yunan provinces, which have shown interest in investing in Bengal's food processing and automobile industries. Bengal's tourism department has also signed an MOU with Yunan Provincial Tourism Corporation for a better inflow of Chinese tourists. The Governor of Yunan province has also expressed interest in setting up an industrial park in Bengal in 2017, but the project is yet to kick off. When Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao visited in 2015, he had promised Mamata that he would provide loans from the Asian Development Bank. She will also be meeting Li Yuanchao on this trip. She also has plans to meet Chinese automobile major Zhongtong who had promised to set up an automobile assembling unit at Andal, Burdwan. Last year they received investment commitment of Rs 2.35 lakh crore. The proposed investment in manufacturing and infrastructure was Rs 61.765 crore. Senior officials of the state industry department said that West Bengal has shared a good rapport with China since Banerjee came to power. In 2015 West Bengal government signed an agreement with Haohong Logistics Corporation for showcasing some rural handicrafts from Bengal in Kunming. Senior officials of the state government said that Mamata is also likely to sign a few MOUs with some Chinese universities for exchange programmes. State parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said – “The chief minister has expressed her desire to visit China after she got an invitation from the Chinese Consul General. The main motive of chief minister’s visit will be to explore different sectors in China and scout for investments for Bengal.” 2017 has been quite a busy year for Banerjee. She travelled to Singapore, Scotland, Bangladesh, Bhutan, England, Netherlands and Germany scouting for investments for the state. With China first on her list this year, 2018 is going to be a busy one for her as well.",2018-01-04,, Calcutta to China: The neighbours will have Mamata visiting the country in June this year | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/calcutta-to-china-the-neighbours-will-have-mamata-visiting-the-country-in-june-this-year-94272.html
568,Charu Kartikeya,"Livid with Gupta's selection, many have alleged that the party has sold the Rajya Sabha ticket to him. On its part, all AAP had to say in defence of Sushil Gupta was that he has contributed “immensely” in education and health. “He provides free education to 15,000 students in the charitable schools in Delhi and Haryana and is also working on the model of charitable university,"" Deputy Chief Minister   said. Another defence given by the party is that it had reached out to as many as 18 luminaries in various fields and offered them the three RS seats. However, all of them declined, citing various reasons. After that, the choice before the party was limited. Many believe that selecting two “Guptas” will help the party in sending the right messages to the Vaishya community, whose members have traditionally been BJP's voters in Delhi. Winning their support is critical for AAP's expansion in Delhi as well as neighbouring Haryana. Delhi's politics has been dominated for a long time by two communities – the Punjabi khatris and Vaishyas. Party chief and Delhi Chief Minister   himself belongs to the same community. However, AAP's irony is that people do not look at the party with the traditional approach that is like a template in Indian politics. This leads to a setback to expectations whenever AAP takes steps steeped in realpolitik. Having said that, the final verdict on AAP's three MPs in the RS will rest only on their performance in the Upper House. What issues they raise, how effectively they speak and how they conduct themselves will be watched with close scrutiny.The three names Aam Aadmi Party has selected for ushering the party in the Rajya Sabha appear to have confounded many party workers, followers and admirers. Among the three, the surprise is not so much over Sanjay Singh, who is one of the party's founders, but over fresh inductees ND Gupta and Sushil Gupta. ND Gupta is a chartered accountant and is the vice-president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) while Sushil Gupta is the owner of a large number of educational and healthcare institutions in Delhi and the adjoining region. Among the duo, N D Gupta was reportedly associated with   beforehand, having advised them on accounting-related matters. He is expected to be the party's voice in the Upper House, looking at various aspects of the long-term impacts of demonetisation and GST on the economy. The strongest buzz is over the name of Sushil Gupta, who was with the Congress till recently. He had contested Assembly polls in Delhi in 2013 against AAP on a Congress ticket and was the second-richest candidate, with declared assets worth Rs 164 crore. He runs over 20 schools, higher education institutes and hospitals in Delhi and the adjoining region.

569,Rajeev Khanna,"It appears that the fear and enigma of Prime Minister   and BJP president   has waned among the BJP’s rank and file in Gujarat. For the first time, senior leaders are raising voices of discontent in the two leaders’ home state against decisions that have come right from the top. This was never the case before. The rank and file of the party in its citadel never dared to raise their voice and those who did had to eat their words and sit down at the place shown to them. It all began with deputy chief minister Nitin Patel coming up with murmurs of rebellion at not being given portfolios of his choice. This was amidst reports of senior MLA Babubhai Bokhiria being unhappy at being dropped from the Cabinet by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. It took Amit Shah's intervention to appease Nitin Patel. But just a couple of days later, Koli leader and minister of states for fisheries Parshottam Solanki has expressed dissatisfaction over not getting a 'significant' portfolio. He skipped the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday and instead held a small show of strength at his residence in Gandhinagar. He has exerted pressure on the BJP government through his community members who are demanding that with his fifth term as a legislator Solanki's stature in the cabinet must rise. On Tuesday, Solanki, who was embroiled in a Rs 400 crore fisheries scam in 2009, had reportedly said, “The community was expecting that as their leader, I would get a better portfolio and a better position in the government. I have been given only one portfolio, fisheries, while earlier I had two or more portfolios. The party has directly given Cabinet rank to members elected only for the second time, why have I been ignored when this is my fifth term? My community influences more than 45 assembly seats and most of them are with BJP. This constant neglect will breach their trust. If this situation continues till 2019, my community may explore other options.” Popularly known as 'Bhai', this Bhavnagar (Rural) MLA heads his brigade of Koli Sena with more than 10,000 foot soldiers. Before shifting base to Bhavnagar in 1998, his name had reportedly figured in cases of rioting and arson in Mumbai that had had followed the demolition of the Babri mosque in 1992. His name found mention in the Srikrishna commission report on Mumbai violence. Meanwhile, there are reports of several other MLAs who have been divested of their portfolios or other posts also starting to raise their voice at the 'injustice' done to them. There are many MLAs who have served three to five terms as the state legislators but have never been given any portfolio. They are also pitching for important positions. Reports say that a group of former Congress leaders such as CK Raulji, Ramsinh Parmar, Vipul Chaudhary, and others have who joined the BJP recently met Rupani and Nitin Patel demanding a place in the new government. Congress leaders who lost the recent polls after being fielded on a BJP ticket are also seeking positions like parliamentary secretaries. On the other hand the BJP leaders appointed to various boards, corporations, and government agencies are seeking renewal of their terms. Observers say that amid such a scenario, Rupani might be going in for a Cabinet expansion very soon. But the moot issue is the loosening grip of Modi and Shah over their own party in the state. There are several examples of how any voice being raised was quelled within no time when Modi's popularity and strength in the state was at its zenith with Amit Shah as his closest lieutenant. One is reminded of how in 2004 the present Union minister Smriti Irani had to retract her statement against Modi on the issue of 2002 Gujarat riots within hours. Sources say that television channel camera persons were persuaded to go to the sets of a television soap opera she was shooting for to get her footage of withdrawing her statement Then there was the episode of Gordhan Zadaphia refusing to take oath as a minister in Modi's government and party MLA Bavku Undhad offering to quit in a dramatic manner by arriving at the BJP state headquarters in an ambulance in 2005 on the issue of Modi sidelining his predecessor Keshubhai Patel. Keshubhai and Zadaphia had gone on to float the Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP) before the 2012 assembly polls. Keshubhai won his seat but eventually everyone had to do a 'gharwapsi'. At this point the picture that is emerging is totally different with party functionaries daring to become more vocal than ever before despite knowing that the things are being decided by none other that Modi and Amit Shah at the centre. “The fact that the grip of Modi and Amit Shah is loosening is true. This is natural when a party comes to power with a narrow margin. The process had started before the elections when leaders like Liladhar Vaghela and Prabhatsinh Chauhan had demanded tickets for their family members. This happened for the first time in the history of the BJP in Gujarat. After the elections more leaders have become vocal,” points out senior political analyst Suresh Samani. Social and political analyst Achyut Yagnik analyses this change from a different perspective. According to him, the state’s movement towards caste based politics has a role in this. “The Patidar agitation and the caste taking precedence over other factors has led to this. Beyond a point they could not do anything about the Patidars also. With caste over riding other factors this has been an outcome. Parshottam Solanki is a Koli and his community accounts for 20 per cent of the state population,” he says. Meanwhile, another senior analyst Prakash Shah says “It is a reality that Modi and Shah’s hold over the party leaders has weakened and they no longer have the power to contain them. Earlier too they had reconciled to things like having Parshottam Solanki in the state Cabinet despite his name figuring in criminal cases. What was being discussed in 'hush hush' tones is now coming out in the open,” he said. With their eyes now on the states in the south and the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Amit Shah and Modi will have to do some mending in their own backyard soon. Otherwise the ride is not going to be a smooth one for them and their party.  ",2018-01-04,, Why Modi and Shah are losing control over BJP in Gujarat | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-modi-and-shah-are-losing-control-over-bjp-in-gujarat-94275.html
570,Ashwin Aghor,"The attack on the celebration of 200 years of the battle of Bhima Koregaon and the following violence has put the Maharashtra government in a tight spot. On one hand, the Devendra Fadnavis government is facing flak for failing to contain the violence. On the other hand it is caught in a bind over arresting the two Hindutva leaders alleged to be behind the attack – Manohar ‘Sambhaji’ Bhide of Shiv Pratishthan and and Milind Ekbote of Samast Hindu Aghadi. Instead, the state government on Thursday chose to crackdown on a students’ event organised by Chhatra Bharti where Dalit MLA from Gujarat, Jignesh Mevani, and Jawaharlal Nehru University student leader Umar Khalid were present. Mevani and Khalid had also spoken at the Elgar Parishad in Bhima Koregaon along with Rohith Vemula’s mother Radhika Vemula. The Elgar Parishad was organised at Pune to commemorate 200 years of Bhima Koregaon battle, where 500 Mahar soldiers in British Army helped defeat the Peshwa’s army. This is seen as a triumph for Dalits, who were subjected to brutal oppression under the Peshwa. The attack on the people attending the celebrations as well as the desecration of the memorial of Govind Gaikwad, the Mahar who had performed the last rites of Shivaji’s son Sambhaji, incensed Dalits against not just the Hindutva outfits behind the attack but also the Maharashtra government. Fadnavis is now caught in a Catch-22 situation. If he arrests the two Hindutva leaders, he runs the risk of angering the BJP’s core constituency. This is especially dangerous as Bhide is known to be close to the RSS. But any failure to arrest them, will anger the Dalit community. “If BJP doesn’t arrest Bhide and Ekbote, they will be the losers. BJP has been given an issue on a platter, all they need to do is do their job,” Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh leader Prakash Ambedkar. Furthermore Fadnavis who was already facing criticism for the fire at Kamala Mills, is now being criticised for his failure to maintain law and order in the state. Not only did the authorities fail to provide protection to the Bhima Koregaon battle anniversary celebrations, they also mishandled the violence that followed as well as Wednesday’s Maharashtra Bandh. This has become a major embarrassment for Fadnavis, who was being projected as one of the more efficient BJP chief ministers. The entire row has revived the political fortunes of Prakash Ambedkar. He was instrumental in organising an extremely successful Maharashtra Bandh. But in an astute move, he called it off in less than a day, demonstrating his power as well as his maturity. After a meeting with CM Fadnavis on January 4 morning, Ambedkar claimed that the government has agreed to all his demands such as immediately suspending combing operation to arrest protesting Dalit youths and the creation of a judicial inquiry into the attack on the Elgar Parishad. The Maharashtra government’s heavy-handed approach has also catapulted Jignesh Mevani from a Gujarat MLA to a national level Dalit politician. Veteran journalist Kumar Ketkar says that the violence over Bhima Koregaon incident has come as a shot in the arm for politicians like Mevani and Prakash Ambedkar but it will harm Fadnavis.  “The incident has punctured the BJP claim of inclusive politics. The violence will harm Fadnavis in long term, though not in short term. BJP will face the consequences ahead of the Lok Sabha and state Assembly elections in 2019. As far as Mewani is concerned, he will be cut to size soon. Had it not been for the Congress, Mewani would not have become an MLA,” he said. Referring to NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Ketkar said, “He wants to appease only Marathas, and has nothing to do with Dalits. The Maratha rallies taken out in Maharashtra were in fact against the Dalit community, but were portrayed as anti-Brahmin. Pawar’s stand on the issue over last three days is self explanatory. We don’t need Pawar to tell us to be united and considerate about each other.”  According to senior journalist Abhar Deshpande said, “BJP won the last Assembly election on the issue of development. But now it has walked into the trap of caste politics. Fadnavis is a lone warrior in the state BJP and no one is helping him”. Some observers feel that Fadnavis had no other choice.  “It is easier said than done. In my opinion, Fadnavis did a right thing to allow passage to the anger of Dalit people that was waiting to explode after Maratha rallies last year. Had the police resorted to harsh action such as cane charge or tear gas, the situation would have taken a serious turn and violence would have continued for a week or so,” said veteran political analyst Ganesh Torsekar.",2018-01-04,, Bhima Koregaon violence: Why BJP & Devendra Fadnavis are the net losers | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bhima-koregaon-violence-why-bjp-devendra-fadnavis-are-the-net-losers-94276.html
571,Atul Chandra,"The government promised jobs for the youth and an uplift for the farm sector, which the chief minister recently said was pivotal to the state’s development agenda. The demand for free land by many investors might be a hurdle though. “That is a problem area and we are trying to find a way out,” said a bureaucrat who is a key member of the organising team.  Also, the government will have to ensure divisive policies and politics do not scare away investors. Only recently, Adityanath courted controversy with a comment on Taj Mahal, which has been the state’s main selling theme for the summit’s tourism sector.  Another challenge would be translating the promises into real deals, an official reportedly told the media.  This time the UP government has roped in Ernst & Young as consultants. It was engaged by the previous regime too but this government is said to be following its advice more closely. There will be 12 focus areas for the upcoming summit, including agriculture, food processing, information technology, tourism, medium, small and mini enterprises (MSME), manufacturing and health. In the first four years of  's (SP government) chief ministership memoranda of understanding (MoU) worth Rs 45,000 crore were signed, up from an estimated Rs 10,000 cr during the same period under   (BSP government).  “Very little of the Rs 45,000 crore actualised by way of investment,” said Industrial Development Commissioner Anoop Chandra Pandey. Letters have now been sent to those who backed out of MoUs to persuade them to reconsider their decisions, he added. The previous two governments failed to bring about any change in the state’s profile. While the Yadav government was found wanting on the law-and-order front, Mayawati's era was infamous for corruption. Although MoUs worth thousands of crores were signed, UP's economic indicators are hardly better than neighbouring Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh or Haryana. Even earlier Yadav's father   constituted a State Development Council under the chairmanship of controversial SP leader  . He roped in corporate czars and Bollywood biggies to sell dreams to the people. Barring some crony capitalists and celebrities who loved dancing to Subrata Roy Sahara’s tunes none chose to invest. With crime and corruption at their worst in those days, investors preferred states like Gujarat and, especially, Andhra Pradesh where Chandrababu Naidu was on an overdrive cutting red tape and setting up an effective facilitating mechanism for investors.  Uttar Pradesh, which has been performing poorly on the economic front, will host an array of prospective investors at a summit in Capital Lucknow next month in a bid to fast-track development. This won't be the first such meet though for the state, that desperately needs an economic boost.  The erstwhile   (SP) government organised three such summits in Mumbai, Delhi and Agra.

572,Rajeev Khanna,"Farm distress was an issue that propelled the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress into power in Punjab almost a year ago. Today it is the very same issue on which the government stands on a sticky wicket even as it gets ready to roll out a farm loan waiver that it had announced last summer.  The government is facing charges of not fulfilling its poll promises, favouritism and duping the masses on this issue from the farming community as well as its political opponents. In the last one month, Punjab has seen a series of protests on the issue and these protests are still continuing. It was on 18 October that the Punjab government issued a notification on the loan waiver that Amarinder had announced on 19 June. Under the scheme around 10.22 lakh debt-ridden farmers will reportedly get a benefit of Rs 9,500 crore. Till 31 March 2017 Punjab’s farmers owed Rs 59,620 crore to various banks. The basis of loan waiver is the amount due from the farmers only to cooperative, public sector and private banks till 31 March 2017. Amarinder had announced a waiver of debt up to Rs 2 lakh for farmers who own land holding up to 2.5 acres and also to those also who have between 2.5 to 5 acres of land with some conditions. Initially, all loans taken from cooperative banks were to be waived and this was to be followed by the public sector and private banks. But things seem to have gone haywire. Starting September, the farmers have been agitating on the delay in the loan waiver. They have also been accusing the government of going back on its words pointing that that the Congress, in the run-up to the elections, had promised a complete loan waiver and what it has delivered is a partial one. Amarinder is set to roll out the scheme from Mansa on 7 January with around 47,000 marginal farmers from five districts of the region Mansa, Bathinda, Sangrur, Muktsar and Moga receiving cheques towards loans taken from cooperative institutions. There are reportedly around 1.42 lakh marginal farmers in these five districts. What is being reported from various corners of the state now is that the lists of beneficiaries that have been prepared are full of flaws. The intensity of the matter can be gauged from that instance of Sikandar Singh, a farmer in Rodewala village of Sangrur, reportedly ending his life on Thursday because his name was missing from the list of beneficiaries. Even otherwise there have been protests at some places by farmers who claim to be the actual beneficiaries and not being included in the lists that have been prepared across the districts. There have been reports of a very large number of farmers hitting the Aadhar card hurdle as they have been unable to provide their unique identification numbers to the authorities. In addition to this are the routine technical faults. “I do not see anything tangible coming out of the whole affair. I am yet to come across a genuine beneficiary contacted by the government. They fail to realise that majority of the loans taken by the farmer are from moneylenders and commission agents on which nothing has been done,” points out Ahbab Singh Grewal who has been leading several farmer programmes for the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) in the state. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) as gone a step ahead accusing the Congress MLAs of looting the state exchequer by preparing lists of crop loan waiver beneficiaries at their residences while ruthlessly ignoring genuine recipients. Former minister Bikram Singh Majithia has charged that the Congress legislators and halqa in-charges have hijacked the crop loan waiver scheme while booting out small and marginal farmers from it. “Farmers themselves have exposed this fraud by revealing how Congress favourites have been included even as eligible indebted farmers with less than five acres of land have been kept out. There are also accusations of Congressmen demanding bribes from indebted farmers to include their names in the beneficiary list,” he said. Asking the farmers to start ‘gherao’ of legislators and ministers indulging in such malpractices, Majithia said – “There should be an independent inquiry into the entire scam to ensure the perpetrators who are making money out of the misery of indebted farmers are brought to book. The SAD will also start a protest movement in support of the farming community.” Stating that only a comprehensive loan waiver of Rs 90,000 crore covering cooperative and nationalised banks as well as private money lenders would be acceptable to the farming community, Majithia said: “The current crop loan waiver scheme is fraud as the government reduced the number of beneficiaries from 10 lakh to two lakh. Now it has come about that there is a scam even in this. The current scheme does not include all farmers who own less than five acres of land. Small farmers with five acres of land who have availed a loan of over Rs 2 lakh have been made non-eligible for the scheme. It also does not give any relief to those who are under stress and are committing suicide because it caters to only 5% of farmers who have defaulted on crop loans. Even marginal farmers with 2.5 acres of land and farm labourers have been kept out of the scheme.” According to Majithia, the number of suicides has gone up to almost 400 in the last ten months of the Congress rule. The Akalis have also condemned the manner in which the government has been pasting lists of indebted farmers in villages and subjecting them to social and mental torture. “Such farmers now run the risk of being branded as lifelong debtors and will have to pay a heavy social price for the same. The social stigma attached to them will even affect the marriage prospects of their daughters,” Majithia said.

573,Anurag Dey,"“A self-proclaimed Ambedkar bhakt, the Prime Minister must clarify his position as to whether Dalits have the right to peacefully assemble and take out a rally in a legal manner,” asked Mevani addressing a press conference in the national capital.  “Since he became the Prime Minister, the institutionalised killing of Rohit Vemula happened, the Una incident, attacks on Dalits in Saharanpur and now the attack in Bhima Koregaon”. “In all these incidents, what is common is Modi’s silence and lack of action against the perpetrators. It’s time for the Prime Minister and this government to clarify their stand whether they have any commitment towards Dalit welfare. Whether they want to eradicate the caste system as envisioned by Babasaheb Ambedkar,” he said.  “When we took out a rally from Ahmedabad to Una, it was attacked and protestors assaulted, the protest rally in Saharanpur was also subjected to same treatment and now the attack on the rally in Bhima-Koregaon. Why isn’t the Dalit safe in India?  This question is now of paramount importance, that the Prime Minister, who calls himself an Amberkarite, an Ambedkar bhakt, why is he silent?” asked Mevani. “  we remember Ambedkar as the framer of our constitution, but his motto in life was annihilation of the caste system from the country. The PM talks about ‘Make in India’, about digital India about cashless society. We too want that but simultaneously we also want a casteless India”. “  when we are exploring the possibility of Mars having water or whether moon can be inhabited, why is the demon of caste still alive?” he asked. The police have registered a first information report against Mevani and JNU student leader Umar Khalid for instigating the violence in Bhima-Koregaon that left a youth dead. The FIR is on the basis of a complaint that the duo during an event in Pune on   made inflammatory speeches that led to violence.  The Centre’s ruling BJP and its ideological mentor RSS also have indicted Mevani and the JNU brigade for the violence.    But the independent Gujarat MLA asserted he was neither present at the site nor was his speech inflammatory or provocative. He also ridiculed the police action against him.  “The first thing that I want to clarify is that I was not present at the location (Bhima-Koregaon), secondly my speech which is available on the internet, no part of it was inflammatory or provocative in any way. In fact it was my most progressive speech. “Moreover, despite being present in Maharashtra, I did not participate in the shutdown that was called in protest against the attack. So when I was neither present nor my speech was inflammatory so how could I instigate violence?” argued Mevani. The shutdown was called by Dalit groups in protest against the attacks during the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon battle in Pune district.   He said the police action against him was indicative of BJP’s nervousness after the Gujarat polls where it struggled to retain power winning 99 seats.      “The way RSS-BJP’ pride has come crashing from their dream of 150+ to 99, coupled with my increase in popularity, they are nervous and they are trying to target me in this childish way”. “When the Maharashtra government should look towards making amends, they have targeted me. Filing a frivolous case against a Dalit leader, won’t that worsen matters? We want rule of law in Maharashtra but at the same time, the way Dalits were targeted in Bhima Koregaon, action must be taken against the attackers,” he said Going hammer and tongs against the RSS-BJP over Dalit atrocities, Mevani sounded a stern warning.   “The RSS-BJP’s agenda has been targeting Dalits and Muslims. But now they have moved to targeting farmers and workers as well. And finally through GST and demonetisation, they are targeting traders. To sum up, we the people of India have all become the victims of Gujarat model,” he said. Expressing his angst over the police denying him the permission for an event in Maharashtra, Mevani said: “MPs/MLAs have the duty to raise issues in Parliament or the Assembly. But when it comes to issues like caste, peaceful people’s movement on the streets is equally important. “So when an elected representative is not allowed to participate in a people’s movement it speaks volumes about Modi’s conduct. “But, I want to say one thing in clear terms. If the atrocities against Dalits in Gujarat and Maharashtra continue and there are attempts to tarnish my image, we will teach you (Modi) a befitting lesson in 2019,” asserted Mevani.Going on the offensive against the BJP-RSS, Dalit leader and Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani questioned Prime Minister  ’s continued silence over the anti-Dalit violence in Bhima-Koregaon.

574,Rajeev Khanna,"The Gujarat government facility at Mahatma Mandir in the state capital of Gandhinagar is currently playing host to a Global Patidar Summit 2018, a community-centred business event that aims to further develop the economically and politically powerful community of Patels. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, while inaugurating the summit in the presence of a large number of his cabinet colleagues, inferred complete government support to the event which has been organised by a philanthropic community organisation Sardardham Vishwa Patidar Kendra (SDVPK). Congress leaders from the Patidar community like Paresh Dhanani also attended the event while Prime Minister   decided to give it a miss. The event, however, comes at a time when the Patidar community stands divided with youth leader   demanding reservation benefits in educational institutions and government jobs. Hardik had joined hands with the Congress in the recent elections that saw the   (BJP) sliding to below the three-figure mark in the polls. The Patel players in the industry have come together to work employment generation, entrepreneurship and skill development among the Patidar youths. They have unveiled a 'Mission 2026' looking at employment, skill development, business linkages and entrepreneurship promotion for the community members. The organisers have claimed that delegates from 32 countries would be attending the event. Reports have quoted SDVPK president Gagji Sutaria saying – “To harness youth, we have decided to form a body of 10,000 industrialists and employ 10 lakh youth by 2026. We want to encourage 10,000 girls and boys to join the administrative services.” He added – “The association will create entrepreneurship and business opportunities for some 10 lakh Patidar youth.” The SDVPK has reportedly committed an investment of Rs 100 crore to set up a training centre and a hostel. The community associations that have come together for the initiative include Umiya Career Development Council, Sola and Leuva Patel Pragati Mandal, Nikol in Ahmedabad, Shree Kanam Pradesh Patidar Seva Samaj, Vadodara, Umiya Career Development Council, Mehsana, Kadva Patidar Samaj, Gandhinagar, Unjha Kelvani Mandal, Unjha, Sardar Patel Seva Trust, Bhavnagar and Samast Patidar Samaj, Surat. The SDVPK plans to hold this event every two years. In his inaugural address, Rupani gave a call to all communities for ‘Service to the Nation through service to the society’, to reduce the differences between different societies and to reduce the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Rupani said the Patidars, while being known for their honesty and hard-working enterprising spirit, inheriting the qualities required for farming have switched over to industries and self-employment, befitting the changing times. Ten Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) for setting up new industries, self-employment, competitive examinations and other fields were signed on the occasion in the presence of Rupani and the Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel. This business event assumes political significance in the present scenario in Gujarat where a section of the Patidar community has been fighting for reservation benefits over the last two years. “This event in a way is a counter to what Hardik and his team have been demanding. The organisers and supporters are in a tacit way trying to convey that the Patidar community has been in a position of 'job givers' through the enterprises the Patels have set up in globally and they would not want the tag of 'job seekers',” says an observer based in Ahmedabad. There is a joke in Gujarat that the authorities at the US visa offices reject the applications where the applicant's surname is Patel. This is because the motels in America have come to be known as 'Potels' with the Gujarati Patels acquiring a large number of them. “This event is of no significant value except being a socio-economic statement on behalf of a section of the community. What is being talked about has been an age-old practice among Patels and they do not need to be taught business skills. The community has always tried to help members establishing enterprise either at the village level or at the bigger level. A new Patel entrepreneur gets orders from other Patidars in business without saying. It is just that the normal practice has been covered with jargons like 'global linkages' etc.,” said a youth member from the Patidar community. It is being pointed out that the community members have enough business and entrepreneurial skills at hand to multiply their businesses. All they need is a conducive atmosphere to do so. The Gujarat government in the run-up to the recent polls had decided in September to set up a commission for the educational and economic upliftment of the upper castes after negotiating with the Patidars agitating for reservation. This Unreserved Class Welfare Commission was to be modelled on the lines of other community-based welfare boards and corporations. Observers say that the Rupani-led BJP government will be trying every thing to ensure that the Patidars return to the party support base en-block before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls because his own future as the state chief minister hinges on what he delivers in these polls. The BJP had won all the 26 Lok Sabha seats in 2014 polls under the Modi wave.",2018-01-06,, Message from Patidar Summit in Gandhinagar – the community is 'job giver' not 'job seeker' | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/message-from-patidar-summit-in-gandhinagar-the-community-is-job-giver-not-job-seeker-94443.html
575,Charu Kartikeya,"The Winter Session of Parliament that just concluded is likely to be soon forgotten as a mundane event. That is just the reason why it ought to be highlighted what the significance of the session was. First, the government delayed calling the session itself as it would have come in the way of the Assembly polls in Gujarat. Winter sessions are usually convened in the middle or towards the end of November and last for about a month. In 2016, the session ran from 16 November to 16 December. In 2015, Parliament sat from 27 November to 23 December. In 2014, the sittings were from 25 November to 23 December. In contrast to all these sessions, winter session 2017 saw sittings only from 15 December to 5 January. Second, the Gujarat polls themselves were delayed and it was quite obvious that the delay gave the BJP, in power in the state and at the Centre, more time to pursue the voters in Gujarat. So, the Winter Session was, essentially, sacrificed at the altar of BJP's fortunes in Gujarat. Third, it was an unproductive session because of the reduction in the number of sittings and also because of needless controversies triggered by the BJP-led union government. Data compiled by PRS Legislative Research puts productivity of Lok Sabha at 78% and of Rajya Sabha at 54%, much lower than in previous years of the 16th Lok Sabha. Winter Session 2016 was an exceptional session because of the crippling shadow of government's shocking move of demonetisation. In 2015, the corresponding figures were 98% and 50% while in 2014, the figures were 98% and 58%. In the Lok Sabha, Winter Session 2017 saw only 13 sittings that were spread over 61 hours and 48 minutes. Over 14 hours and 51 minutes were lost due to interruptions and forced adjournments, even as the House also sat late for 8 hours and 10 minutes. Only 16 government bills were introduced and 12 were passed. These included - – The Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Amendment Bill, 2017 – The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2017 – The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017 – The High Court And The Supreme Court Judges (Salaries And Conditions Of Service) Amendment Bill, 2017 On an average, only about 3.46 questions were answered every day. The only saving grace was that about 198 matters of urgent public importance and 226 matters for short duration discussions (under Rule 377) were raised. One short duration discussion under rule 193 was also held on cyclone Ockhi. A total of 98 Private Members’ Bills on different subjects were introduced. The Rajya Sabha also had 13 sittings in which a mere nine government bills were passed and 19 private member bills were introduced. The Upper House lost a whopping 34 hours to disruptions, while a total of 41 hours of business was transacted. The high-point was on 2 January, when the House created a record of taking all the listed starred questions for the first time in 15 years. Chairman   said that the high-point was when the dignity of the offices of the prime minister, former prime minister and other dignitaries was upheld. Naidu was referring to the apology tendered by the government to the Opposition for utterly condemnable thoughts expressed by Prime Minister   earlier. Modi had, in the course of campaigning for his party in Gujarat, tried to portray former PM  , former Vice President   and many others as traitors who were conspiring with Pakistan to defeat the BJP in Gujarat. In the Rajya Sabha during the session, Leader of the House and Finance Minister   apologised to the dignitaries and said his government and his party held them in the highest regard. Naidu calling this moment the high-point of the session proved the nuisance value of PM Modi and his speeches. What Naidu didn't say was that Modi should have been held accountable for assaulting the dignity of the institution of the PM, former PM, former VP and others. The debate over the Triple Talaq Bill got the Opposition riled up, but belatedly. The government successfully got the Bill cleared from the Lok Sabha amid hesitant objections from the Opposition. It was when the Bill reached the Rajya Sabha that the Opposition suddenly discovered flaws in it and stalled its passage. The end of the session also brought the curtains down on one of the worst years for the Parliament ever. The government convened the Parliament for a total of only 57 sittings, which is the   in the entire history of the Parliament, ignoring only election years. 2018 will also see a heavy electoral agenda, with several state assembly polls lined up. This is also the penultimate year of the Modi-government's five-year tenure. Politics will certainly rule heavy and the future of Parliament in this year too doesn't appear too bright.",2018-01-05,, A much-eclipsed Winter Session concludes a year of setbacks for Parliament | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/a-much-eclipsed-winter-session-concludes-a-year-of-setbacks-for-parliament-94364.html
576,Rajeev Khanna,"Cutting across the party lines, ex-MLAs in Haryana stand an agitated lot. Not only are they disgruntled at the low basic pension that they are getting, they are also very annoyed with the Manohar Lal Khattar led   (BJP) government in the state for not having revised their dearness allowance over the last two years. They claim that the basic pension being given to them along with other facilities is far less than what is being given by many other states that are ranked far below Haryana in terms of their economy. These include states like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and even the neighbouring hill state of Himachal Pradesh, Ironically, it is the BJP that is in power in these states. At present there are 290 former MLAs in Haryana. A meeting of the ex-MLAs Association of Haryana was held on Saturday where the participants once again discussed the issues. They have now aired hope that the Khattar government would address their concerns during the forthcoming Budget session of the state Assembly failing which they would be calling a general house of the members to decide upon the future course of action. “The ex-MLAs function almost like the sitting MLAs in society. They are expected to shell out money at various social events where they are called. With a low pension and paucity of other benefits most of them are undergoing a tremendous constrain. While the government has gone ahead doling out benefits to the sitting MLAs and increasing their salaries, this has not been the case as far as ex-MLAs are concerned. Earlier, the pension of the ex-MLAs was increased whenever there was a hike in the emoluments of the sitting MLAs. On top of this we have been deprived of our dearness allowance,” says former Congress MLA Rann Singh Mann. Two-time Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) MLA from Bahadurgarh Nafe Singh Rathi pointed out, “Around 50 per cent of the ex-MLAs are living a life of poverty. Around 95 per cent of us are more than 60 years of age and around 90 per cent are on medication.” The ex-MLAs had recently sent their colleague Ranbir Singh Mandola to different states to gather information on the perks being paid to the former legislators there. Rathi disclosed that while the basic pension of a former MLA in Haryana is Rs 10,000 per month. He said that Maharashtra is giving Rs 50,000 with an annual monthly increase of Rs 2,000, Karnataka is giving Rs 40,000 with an increase of Rs 1,000 per month annually, Jharkhand is giving Rs 30,000 with an annual monthly increase of Rs 3000 to Rs 8,000, Madhya Pradesh is giving Rs 20,000, Uttar Pradesh Rs 25,000 and Himachal Pradesh is giving Rs 36,000 with an annual increase of Rs 1,000 per month. The ex-MLAs of Haryana want a cashless card facility for availing medical treatment against the compensation at government rates for their families. They say that Himachal Pradesh is providing the families of ex-legislators medical facilities given to class one gazetted officers, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are giving a complete reimbursement while Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh give a monthly medical allowance of Rs 15,000 along with reimbursement of indoor and outdoor treatment to the whole family. Similarly the Jharkhand and Karnataka governments give a medical allowance of Rs 5,000 besides reimbursement for treatment. In terms of travel facilities, a former MLA in Maharashtra is entitled to 35,000 km railway travel in AC first class along with a second class facility for an attendant besides free bus travel along with one person. Karnataka government provides Rs 1 lakh per year to its former legislators for air and train travel besides free bus travel with one person. Jharkhand is providing Rs 3 lakh for air, rail or fuel charges besides free bus travel along with one person. Chhattisgarh too gives Rs 2 lakh for rail and air travel along with the free bus travel along with one person while Madhya Pradesh gives a facility of 15,000 km free rail and air travel outside the state along with unlimited free air, rail and bus travel within the state. Uttar Pradesh government provides Rs 1 lakh for travel of ex-MLAs which includes rail coupons worth Rs 50,000 along with Rs 50,000 as fuel allowance. Himachal Pradesh provides Rs 1.25 lakh for air, rail and travel by private vehicles along with free bus travel with one attendant. But the Haryana ex-MLAs are only entitled to free bus travel for themselves only. “We have even offered to deduct money from our pensions and issue a bus pass for the couples,” said an ex-MLA. The former MLAs of Haryana said that in terms of other facilities Maharashtra government allows free travel in local trains and steamers to its former legislators besides the facility to stay at rest houses at normal rates. The Karnataka government provides facilities worth Rs 1 lakh along with Rs 50,000 for hearing aids and Rs 10,000 for dental care. The Jharkhand government charges just Rs 100 for their stay in Jharkhand Bhawan in Delhi while the Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh governments provides this facility at their bhawans in Delhi and state rest houses at nominal rates. In case of Himachal, the ex-MLAs get a loan of Rs 15 lakh for a house or a car at an interest rate of 4 per cent. Their phone charges are taken care of and they get to stay at government facilities at nominal rates. But in Haryana’s case, an ex-MLA is supposed to pay Rs 750 per day for staying at Haryana Bhawan and Rs 500 at rest houses. “This is far more than what the government charges from its officers and even journalists. To add insult to injury the staff is reluctant to provide us accommodation. They are often heard saying that there is no room available,” said an ex-MLA. Rathi said that even if the allowances paid to them at 245 per cent on their basic pension is taken into consideration, their total emoluments are far less than their counterparts in other states. To dispel the questions about some legislators getting total emoluments close to Rs 2 lakh for having been elected MLAs and MPs on multiple occasions, he claimed that the number of such persons does not cross five in the state. If the former legislators are complaining of not being able to make the two ends meet, one can understand the plight of lakhs of people in the state who are underemployed on contract basis. It is a poor reflection on the state of affairs.",2018-01-08,, Ex-MLAs in Haryana are crying for better emoluments.

577,Neeraj Thakur,"Despite a fall in private sector investments in the last three years, the Indian government has managed to push the country's GDP growth. Low crude bills were one of the biggest reasons. When crude oil prices halved between 2014 and 2016, the government increased excise duty on petroleum products and generated a windfall revenue that went up from Rs 1.3 lakh crore to Rs 2.1 lakh crore. Not just this; dividends from downstream oil PSUs rose Rs 0.9 lakh crore. The Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCG), a proxy for private investment in the country fell to 29.5% in 2016-17 as against 30.9% in 2015-16. It further fell to the level of 27.5% in the first quarter of 2017-18. In the second quarter of the current fiscal the GFCF was 28.9% of the GDP. The third quarter does not look promising either as new investment proposals by India Inc fell to a 13-year low of Rs 76.8 thousand crore in the October-December quarter of 2017. The government expenditure, represented by Government Final Consumption Expenditure, during 2016-17 went up to 11% as against 9.8% in 2015-16. In the second quarter of 2017-18 the GFCE grew by 12.5% of the GDP. Clearly, the government is spending more and more to keep India's GDP growth from falling. But it is not going to be possible in the face of rising crude oil prices, as India imports around 80% of its oil needs and the government is already walking a tight rope due to fall in revenue after implementing Goods and Services Tax. The Ministry of Finance has already announced additional borrowing of Rs 50,000 crore through long-term securities from markets to meet expenditure in the last quarter of the current fiscal. To make things worse retail inflation is on the verge of crossing the comfort zone (4% - 6%) of Reserve Bank. According to an estimate by Nomura, a sustained $10 per barrel hike in crude oil prices can impact consumer price inflation by as much as 0.6-0.7% points. Having to deal with high inflation would be the last challenge that Indian government would want, especially in the terminal year of its rule before it seeks fresh mandate from people. In the given scenario, Modi government can only hope that it does not have to deal with problem of expensive crude oil.No expert can dare to try and accurately predict the price of crude oil. Barring a few exceptions, crude prices have always been unpredictable. On Wednesday brent futures crossed $67 a barrel -- the highest since 2015. Compared with that, in February 2016 the price fell to $27 a barrel. This jump has prompted the question: Will crude breach the $70 mark? The answer: Depends on whether you look at the technical aspect of the business or its geopolitical intricacies. Technically, even crossing $65 should not have been possible. Global oil demand is expected to rise by about 1.3 million barrels per day in 2018, according to International Energy Agency. At the same time, output from outside Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is set to rise by 1.6 million barrels a day. This means that all things constant, there should not be any rise in the price of crude oil in the current year. Moreover, with every rise in the price of crude oil, shale oil companies in the US begin to pump out more. Yet, hedge funds are increasing their bets on the rise in crude oil prices. And they have reasons for doing so. Iran that produces about 3.8 million barrels per day and exports 60% of it, is witnessing mass protests by people against the government. Even though protests have had no impact on Iran's oil production, given the nature of protestors, what if workers in oil fields resort to strikes? Given the interest of US President Donald Trump's interest in the anti-government protests in Iran (read his tweets), one would not be surprised if the situation goes out of control in the West Asian country. One also cannot ignore the 'no-impact' of the restart of North Sea Forties pipeline system (FPS) on the oil prices. The FPS is a major export pipeline from more than 80 assets in the UK North Sea and was shut leading to a cut of 450,000 b/d of supplies for two weeks in December after it developed cracks. Last but not least, 2017 saw less than 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent discovered globally -- the lowest since the 1940s. This fall in new discoveries is largely due to capital expenditure cuts by oil companies over the last three years, as their revenue per barrel of oil decreased. Various hedge fund managers and oil experts believe that shale oil production cannot meet cut in production at least in the next two years. “Tight rock is not going to solve the global supply-demand issue,” Bloomberg quoted Adam Waterous, CEO, Calgary-based Waterous Energy Fund as saying. “It's going to take a long time for those mega-projects to come back on.” Waterous added.  ",2018-01-05,, Crude oil: The mother of all shocks awaits Modi govt in 2018.

578,Charu Kartikeya,"The Bill cleared the Lok Sabha thanks to the BJP's brute majority in that House. However, Rajya Sabha proved to be an entirely different game altogether as things didn't go as per the BJP's plan. The Congress and other Opposition parties  a shot in the arm with the support of at least three fence-sitters who have sympathised with the government in the past – DMK,   and TDP . With these three parties in, the Opposition numbers grew and so did the pressure on the government to send the Bill to a parliamentary committee. Refusing steadfast to buckle under that pressure, the government allowed, instead, the Bill to pass into limbo. The battle over triple talaq is likely to continue in 2018, but for now it is the Opposition that seems to have scored a point. The government has been prevented from getting the Bill passed by Parliament and the BJP has been forced to complain of sabotage. What is hard to understand is that why did the government not concede to the demand of the Opposition for subjecting the Bill to deeper parliamentary scrutiny. What was the harm in sending it to a committee? Union Law Minister   has said in an interview that that demand was a “ruse to sabotage” and the Bill isn't so “complicated” that it would merit so much  . Well-known political analyst Professor Balveer Arora told Catch the government feared that if the Bill would go to a parliamentary committee, it will be forced to undergo changes. That, in turn, will dent the image that the BJP wants to project for itself that the party doesn't compromise on such issues. Arora said he suspects that the BJP will now wave the Bill around as proof of its intentions, while claiming helplessness, at the same time, because of the Opposition's stronger numbers in the Upper House. Arora was also of the opinion that the Bill was just one of all the cards that the BJP will start stacking up from now, in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls of 2019. The Congress has explained at various platforms that the draft of the Bill is flawed and it must be corrected. Spokesperson Randeep Surjewala has already flagged the problems – the Bill essentially puts the onus on the Muslim women to suffer the cost and consequences of litigation and does not define “subsistence allowance”. The hesitation of the government “to put in a single line definition” will need to heavy litigation later (http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/this-is-no-reform-triple-talaq-bill-muslim-law-winter-session-5009174/). National spokesperson of Rashtriya  , Manoj Jha, also spoke to Catch and he said this Bill and what happened in the Parliament was a clear case of the BJP's dog-whistle politics that “one should appear doing something, without real intent”. He stressed that this was a far-reaching legislation and should be passed after widest possible consultation. Another Opposition leader said, on condition of anonymity, he believed that the government will take another shot at reviving the Bill in the Budget session and may surrender to the demand for committee scrutiny if it fails to clear the Rajya Sabha again.With the Union government's Triple Talaq Bill neither getting passed nor making it to a Parliamentary committee, it appears that the government's game-plan has been thwarted. There is a clever sub-text to the triple talaq debate. What appears on the surface is a BJP push to outlaw the practice to appear a well-wisher of Muslim women and Muslim society at large. However, behind the scenes is a plan to send out a message to the BJP's core constituency that the project to “discipline” the Muslim community has begun. When the BJP had announced its intention to bring a law to ban instant triple talaq early in December, it was widely believed that there was a strategy behind it. If the Bill gets Opposition support and clears the Parliament, the government will directly succeed in its objective. If the Opposition blocks it, then the government will use the opportunity to malign the Congress and other Opposition parties as pseudo-seculars and as the real enemies of Muslim women. However, what happened in the Rajya Sabha in the last two days of the winter session essentially conveyed that a spanner had been thrown in the BJP's plans.",2018-01-06,, Why the Triple Talaq Bill didn't go the way BJP wanted | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-the-triple-talaq-bill-didn-t-go-the-way-bjp-wanted-94441.html
580,Akash Bisht,"The Congress leadership is upbeat about the by-polls and the upcoming Assembly elections and is citing the growing disenchantment against the Raje government over multiple issues. In fact, they point out the party's improved performance in the recently held by polls for the Zila Parishad. In December, the Grand Old Party won all four Zila Parishad seats, 16 of the 27 Panchayat Samiti seats and six Nagar Palika seats. Back then Congress state president Sachin Pilot had claimed that the countdown to BJP's fall in the state has begun. “The winds of change are blowing in Rajasthan and it will uproot the corrupt Raje regime that has wrecked havoc in the state. They have stopped subsidies meant for poor and the rising price of essential commodities has enraged the people of the state. If one looks at the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, Rajasthan is at the top of the list on multiple fronts,” said Archana Sharma, Media Chairperson, Rajasthan PCC. In fact, the NCRB data reveals that Rajasthan ranks second in human trafficking while it ranks third in rape cases and atrocities against SC/STs. She went on to add how Rajasthan has turned into a hate laboratory by those associated with BJP, which is reflected in the increase in number of incidents of lynching and other heinous crimes against the minorities. “Whenever such incidents happen, BJP leaders are somehow complicit in these crimes. Further, they make such statements which are fanning communal passions. Instead of putting them behind bars, the state government is openly supporting them. People of Rajasthan do not endorse such blatant misuse of power,” Sharma added. Highlighting the failures of the government, Sharma added how the state is witnessing a spike in deaths due to malnutrition, swine flu and new born deaths which have been proved by the reports of the state government. She further highlighted the growing agrarian crisis in the state which has led to farmers committing suicides across the state. “They have been dilly-dallying on the loan waiver issue. Earlier, they said we will form a committee and now they are saying something about Kerala model. Even the farmers of Rajasthan are fed up with BJP government,” she said. He further added how the by-polls and even Assembly elections will be determined by who fields better candidates. According to him, the by-polls would not have much bearing on the Assembly elections and it will finally come down to candidate selection. “People will vote for candidates and not for one man. In these by-polls, we certainly have better candidates. If the BJP drops 100 odd MLAs, they have an outside chance of giving a tough fight but I don't see that happening,” he said. On the Congress candidates for the by-polls, Khachariyawas said that Dr Karan Singh is a good candidate and he is certain to win because the BJP candidate is a minister and will have to face anti-incumbency. “In fact, if they would have fielded a non minister, Singh would have won without a fight,” he added. When questioned whether Modi magic would have any effect on the people of Rajasthan, Sharma mentioned how the BJP performed poorly in all those constituencies in Gujarat which share their borders with Rajasthan. On the issue of too many leaders claiming for the top post in the Congress, Sharma added that Opposition is raising this issue since they have nothing else to talk about. “We are all united and there are no differences within the party. We will win and even the BJP knows it,” Sharma concluded.After fighting a close contest in Gujarat, the BJP and the Congress are all set to lock horns in the upcoming by-polls in Rajasthan which are likely to set the trend for the Assembly elections in the state. The Vidhan Sabha polls are due in the state later this year and the Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government is battling anti-incumbency and these by-polls are an acid test for her popularity. Both the Congress and the BJP have announced candidates for the Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha seats and the Mandalgarh Assembly seat that go to polls on 29 January. The by-polls on these seats were necessitated after the deaths of the two sitting parliamentarians and Mandalgarh legislator. The stakes are so high that the BJP decided to field Dr Jaswant Singh Yadav, sitting MLA from Behror and a Cabinet minister in the state government, for the Alwar seat which fell vacant after sitting MP Mahant Chand Nath passed away in September last year. Similarly, the saffron party has fielded Ramswarup Lamba, son of former Union minister Sanwar Lal Jat, from the Alwar seat. Jat was the sitting MP from Alwar and passed away in August last year. For the Mandalgarh seat, the BJP has fielded incumbent Bhilwara district president Shakti Singh Hada. Meanwhile, the Congress has fielded former MP Karan Singh Yadav from Alwar, former MLA Raghu Sharma from Ajmer and Vivek Dhakad from Mandalgarh. Congress was the first to announce Karan Singh's name while the two parties announced the names of the rest of the candidates on 7 January. Each of the two Lok Sabha seats has eight Vidhan Sabha segments. If we add Mandalgarh to that, as many as 17 Assembly segments will be voting on 29 January. The Rajasthan Assembly has 200 seats in all. With the Assembly elections a few months away, political pundits are seeing these elections as a semi final before the two parties fight it out to gain control of the state.

With Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje facing much criticism from within the party, these polls have become an acid test on her  popularity as well. The BJP has fielded Labour Minister Jaswant Singh Yadav in Alwar and former Union minister Sanwar Lal Jat’s son Ramswaroop Lamba in Ajmer. Shakti Singh Hada is the nominee for the Mandalgarh Assembly constituency. The Congress has given a ticket to former MLA Raghu Sharma from the Ajmer parliamentary constituency, while it has fielded Dr. Karan Singh Yadav from Alwar constituency. In Mandalgarh, Vivek Dhakkad is the Congress candidate. The polling is scheduled for January 29, while the counting of votes will take place on February 1.  Two doctors from the Yadav community are set to test their political fortunes in the  Alwar parliamentary constituency. Caste factor is to dominate the Alwar contest there is a subtext of doctor vs doctor.  Maximum number of voters in the constituency are Yadavs and both the doctors had started campaigning in the area even before the names were finalised by their respective parties. Dr. Karan Yadav is a former MP who defeated Chand Nath in the 2004 general elections from Alwar. He has also been a two-time MLA from Behror and has served as a superintendent of state-run SMS Hospital in Jaipur between 1998 and 2003. After he joined the Congress, he won state assembly elections from Alwar's Behror constituency and parliamentary elections from the Alwar seat. On the other hand,  Dr. Jaswant Yadav holds a bachelor of Ayurveda, medicine and surgery (BAMS) degree and is a state Cabinet Minister and MLA from Behror. There are eight state Assembly segments in Alwar Lok Sabha seat, accommodating nearly 18.27 lakh voters. Nearly a fourth of the voters in Alwar belong to the Yadav community. Other communities with significant presence are  Meos, Dalits and Brahmins. During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections Ajmer witnessed a high-profile contest between the former Union Minister  Sachin Pilot-- who now heads the Congress in Rajasthan-- and late Sanwar Lal Jat. Jat then had defeated  Pilot by a margin of 1,71,983 votes. The BJP, with a hope to encash the sympathy wave in Ajmer, has fielded  Ramswarup Lamba, the son of the late Jat who passed away in August last year.  Raghu Sharma, the Congress candidate is  a former MLA from Kekri in Ajmer district and has served as chief whip of the party in the Rajasthan Assembly in the past. A PhD holder, Sharma understands constituency's  caste equations and Ajmer is his district. Congress candidate Vivek Dhakkad will fight the election against BJP’s Shakti Singh Hada, the current Zila Pramukh of Bhilwara. Vivek Dhakar was defeated by Kirti Kumari in 2013 state Assembly elections by a margin of nearly 19,000. Many believed that Kirti Kumari managed the victory riding the   wave that helped BJP sweep the elections across the country at the time. Vivek Dhakkad holds an LLB degree and did his MBA from Punjab Technical University. Mandalgarh assembly seat fell vacant following Kirti Kumari's death, suspected to be due to dengue, in August.

582,Atul Chandra,"Following the HYV episode, Adityanath, who saw Maurya as a threat, apparently began to harbour a grudge against his deputy, slighting him at every opportunity. Adityanath made his first move when he promised pothole-free roads by June 15. Sources said that Maurya, who holds the PWD portfolio, was not even consulted. As the unrealistic promise could not be kept, it was Maurya who received flak for the failure. It was announced that the chief minister would sit in his new office located in the Lok Bhawan, vacating his original office on the fifth floor of Secretariat Annexe. However, when Maurya decided to move to ‘ ’ (Yogi's vacated office), the chief minister is understood to have objected to it. Maurya was instead allotted another room. When the Yogi government completed its 100 days in office, a booklet was published to highlight its achievements. While there were photos of other ministers, Maurya’s picture was conspicuous by its absence. It was later explained away as a clerical lapse. More recently, Yogi chose to take Dinesh Sharma, the other deputy chief minister who is believed to be close to BJP national president  , to the swearing-in ceremony of Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. Although one reason for this choice could be that Sharma was earlier the observer for Gujarat, this did not go down well. Soon after, Yogi snubbed Maurya. This time, he and Sharma flew in a government aircraft to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Jai Ram Thakur in Shimla. An upset Maurya took a chartered flight to Shimla. Adityanath later took to Twitter to attack Maurya. On December 30, Yogi tweeted his unhappiness over the PWD's management of road infrastructure, saying, “  (Still a lot of complaints are pouring in).” The CM venting his displeasure over PWD’s working in public was viewed as a direct attack on the functioning of the PWD. And, if the experiences of Dr Radha Mohan Das Agarwal and SP Shukla, who is a minister of state at the Centre, were anything to go by, Adityanath gives his rivals no quarter. BJP spokesman Navin Srivastava denied any rift between the CM and is deputy Maurya. Maurya has a lot of respect for Yogiji and any talk of rift between the two is an act of mischief by the opposition parties, he said. However, such attacks have led to a weakening of Maurya’s hold on his department as bureaucrats and engineers know that their minister’s authority was being undermined by the CM. Barring his hard-line Hindutva, Adityanath himself has nothing much to show for his time in power. He is aware that for the RSS he was going to be the calling card for 2019 parliamentary elections by virtue of being the most strident face of Hindutva. Even if Prime Minister   may not like him, there isn't much he can do about it. That leaves Maurya vulnerable and the backward castes unhappy. Will the PWD minister get sidelined and eventually dropped? Or, will the RSS play peace-maker between the two leaders? Time will tell.By making Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister   the  ’s (BJP) star campaigner, first in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, and now in Karnataka, the   (RSS) has made clear its intentions of using Hindutva as its poll plank. However, despite this primacy, Adityanath still carries a nagging fear of being upstaged by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who was the front-runner in the race for the UP CM post before it finally fell to Adityanath. The tussle between the two was fast turning into a fight between the other backward classes, to which Maurya belongs, and the Rajputs, Yogi’s caste. One reason for this was Maurya’s warning that “outsiders”, read Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV), were being given more importance than party workers. This was when Maurya was holding dual charge of the posts of UP party president as well as deputy chief minister. After an RSS-brokered truce, the Hindu Yuva Vahini retreated to Gorakhpur, but the divide between Yogi and Maurya only widened.",2018-01-09,," Almost a year after becoming CM, Adityanath's feud with Dy CM KP Maurya gets worse | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/almost-a-year-after-becoming-cm-adityanath-s-feud-with-dy-cm-ks-maurya-gets-worse-94684.html

Why don’t we include this fact in the curriculum?” Devnani asked. The State's Primary and Secondary Education Minister said the school curriculum was revised to accommodate nearly 200 Indian personalities, including the warrior king Maharana Pratap. The minister also stressed that education should be value-based. Making a reference to student leader of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Kanhaiya Kumar, the   (BJP) leader said, “No Kanhaiya should be born in Rajasthan. The university should keep that thing in mind. They are anti-social elements of society”.

584,Nishant  Chhabra,"Touching on the slugfest between the ruling BJP and the Congress over taking credit for the refinery, located in the Thar desert, he said the Congress had only laid foundation stones for projects across the country to claim credit. Railway lines were announced just to claim short-term popularity with projects that never ever seeing the light, he charged. The Congress, he said, had ""hoodwinked"" people by making just announcements. Modi said the party, after seeing his commitment to one-rank-one-pension scheme for defence personnel, made a provision for Rs 500 crore in the interim budget just before the 2014 general elections to claim credit. ""Barmer refinery was at least on papers, OROP wasn't even on paper,"" he said, adding that no groundwork on the beneficiaries or on the outgo was ever done. It took one-and-half-years to collate the list of beneficiaries of OROP and the implementation cost Rs 12,000 crore as against Rs 500 crore provided by the Congress, he noted. Of this, four installments totaling Rs 10,700 crore have already been made to defence personnel and the rest would also be paid soon, Modi said. He said while the Congress just gave the slogan of 'garibi hatao' (remove poverty), the BJP government has worked towards doing so by way of providing free cooking gas (LPG) connection to poor women and giving free power connection to the four crore households. Ahead of the event, ruling BJP and opposition Congress bargained hard in public for claiming credit for the refinery. The Congress argument was that the then party president    had laid the foundation stone of the refinery on September 22, 2013, and the Modi act of ""re-laying"" the foundation stone was farcical. But both the Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje said that foundation laying was a political stunt carried out days before the model code of conduct for assembly elections coming into force on September 27, 2013. Neither the land was acquired for the project nor the environment clearance obtained for the foundation laying, they argued. The Tuesday's function, coming as it is  weeks before by-polls for Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha, and Mandalgarh Assembly seats in Rajasthan on January 29, had its own political overtones. The state is scheduled for  Assembly elections  later this year.  (With Agency Inputs)Prime Minister   on Tuesday said the Congress Party and drought are 'twin brothers' as wherever the party goes, there is drought.

585,Rajeev Khanna,"Sources say that there were two reasons for this. “The first was that majority of the VHP and Bajrang Dal cadres are Patidars who had deserted the BJP on the issue of reservation in jobs and educational institutions. Secondly, the cadres of these two outfits are annoyed that the Ram Temple is being hijacked by the BJP and is being handed over to Sri Sri Ravi Shankar keeping in mind the forthcoming polls in the southern state of Karnataka,” says a source. He pointed that the statements on Ram Mandir coming from Sri Sri just when campaign to Gujarat polls was picking up is a pointer towards this. Sources further disclosed that the funding to the VHP has been strangulated over the last few years and the donors who are now putting in money for the programmes of the VHP are doing so anonymously. “The flagship programme of the VHP cadres in Gujarat is the circulation of the annual Panchang among the populace every year on the occasion of Diwali. The printing does not cost more than Rs 25,000. But can you imagine that this time the VHP was struggling to get a sponsor for printing this small booklet? The donors who came forward asked the organisation not to print their names on the Panchang anywhere. The same is the case with the trust run Dhanvantri Hospital started by Togadia after he had sold off his own private hospital to serve the poor patients where people are examined by a doctor with an MD degree for just Rs 20. Even this hospital is facing a resource crunch now,” said a source based in Ahmedabad. “The BJP is trying to send across the message that it has no use of VHP and Bajrang Dal anymore and it can win even crucial elections like the recent Assembly polls without their support. They are now being presented as a liability with their insistence on the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The internal thought process in the RSS is also on the similar lines as it now sees these two organisations responsible for alienation of moderate Hindus from the Sangh Parivar because of their extreme agenda. The Togadia episode is a fallout of these processes,” said an observer based in Ahmedabad. Observers are also pointing at the events being organised by unknown Hindutva organisations in Gujarat to woo the Hindus without taking the VHP or the Bajrang Dal in the loop. One such programme being pointed at is the recently held 'Hindu Adhyatmik Ane Sewa Melo - 2018' (Hindu spiritual and service fair) from January 5 to 8 ) PIX ATTACHED) that was organised by Hindu Spiritual and Service Foundation (HSSF). “If this is not cutting the VHP to site then what is it?” pointed a source. The continuing friction between the BJP and the VHP can also be gauged from the fact that when Togadia had arrived at the court on January 5 with hundreds of VHP and Bajrang Dal activists, the slogans being shouted were “Jai Sri Ram” and the placards that were displayed read “Hindu chalaa jail mein, Saheb tere raj mein” (Hindu goes to jail in your rule, Saheb). The reference Saheb in Gujarat is made in context of Modi. There is another point of view to the entire Togadia episode with skeptics saying that the script to the drama has been penned by the Sangh Parivar to test political waters ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Whatever the cause, the political drama within the saffron camp is expected to continue in the days to come.The lost and found drama involving the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togadia and his tearful submissions before the media on Tuesday indicates that all is not well in the saffron camp. Several observers and sources reveal that the attempts started to marginalise the VHP leadership along with the Bajrang Dal within the Sangh Parivar are now being put in top gear. There are a series of factors responsible for this including the game of one-upmanship within the Sangh Parivar and also the larger design of having a pan India sway by its political wing the   (BJP). The question being debated in the Hindutva camp right now is whether there are attempts being made to cut the VHP and Bajrang Dal to size and with what goal in mind? According to reports, Togadia after going missing for a brief while on Monday told the media on Tuesday that unspecified people are attempting to muzzle him and not let him speak on issues like the Ram temple, welfare schemes for farmers and the law on cow slaughter. He has also pointed at attempts to frame him in fake cases and has aired apprehensions that he might be liquidated. ""I am being targeted for a decades-old case. There is an attempt to suppress my voice. Rajasthan police team came to arrest me. Someone told me plan was being made to kill me in an encounter,"" alleged a tearful Togadia at a press briefing convened by him. The International Working President of the VHP was reportedly found in an unconscious state and admitted to a hospital in Shahibaug area of Ahmedabad on Monday evening after the VHP had reported him missing. Reports quote the Ahmedabad Crime Branch officials saying that his sugar levels had dipped and he had been brought to the Chandramani Hospital in an unconscious state by 108 emergency service. The person who contacted the emergency service has not been disclosed. The event of Togadia going missing was marked by protests by VHP cadres across Gujarat. Media reports quoting Crime Branch officials said that Togadia had arrived at 1 am at VHP office in Paldi with his security staff. He relieved his Z-plus security staff and instructed them to return by 2.30 pm. At around 10.30 am, Togadia left for an undisclosed location in an autorickshaw along with a VHP worker. He told his security guard that he was going out for personal work and would return by 2 pm. Thereafter, Togadia did not return to the VHP office and was later found unconscious and admitted to Chandramani Hospital. Reports say that Rajasthan police had gone to Ahmedabad seeking his arrest in a 10- year-old case registered by the Ashok Gehlot government pertaining to the killing of three people in a programme where Togadia had been present. This is the second instance of law catching up with Togadia in the last fortnight. A non-bailable warrant against Togadia was canceled on January 5 after his appearance before the Ahmedabad Metropolitan Court in a 21-year-old case popularly known as ‘Dhoti kand’ (dhoti episode). The non-bailable warrants were issued against Togadia and 38 others, including BJP MLA Babubhai Patel, for their role in the 20 May 1996 incident when the VHP and Bajrang Dal activists had stripped BJP minister Atmaram Patel of his dhoti minutes after former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee had addressed his first rally after assuming office. Atmaram Patel had been disrobed because he had joined the previous year’s rebellion led by Shankersinh Vaghela who had flown 60 legislators to a tourist resort in Khajuraho that had led to the fall of the first BJP government in Gujarat led by Keshubhai Patel. At present there is a widespread perception among the VHP sympathisers that the RSS and the BJP are trying to cut the VHP to size, a process that had been started more than a decade ago when   had come up as the poster boy of Hindutva. The first strains between the VHP and the BJP had come to fore when the premises of a top VHP functionary were raided by tax officials in 2005. Then the VHP kept aloof in the run-up to the 2007 assembly polls whereas in 2002 it was Togadia who had played a major role in fueling the electoral juggernaut of Modi with his highly provocative speeches. This reporter was shocked to see the VHP top brass preparing for an International Human Rights Day programme instead of campaigning for the BJP with the polling merely three days ahead. Sources further revealed that the next episode in the souring of the relations between the two came in 2008 when VHP leader Ashwin Patel who has involved in supporting the families of Dalits and tribals accused in cases of 2002 anti-Muslim carnage was accused of sending “anti-national” SMSes and was held for sedition. The alienation continued to grow and during the recent Assembly polls the VHP and the Bajrang Dal cadres kept aloof from the electoral campaign.",2018-01-17,, Pravin Togadia lost & found: Are Modi & RSS trying to cut VHP to size? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/pravin-togadia-lost-found-are-modi-rss-trying-to-cut-vhp-to-size-95655.html
586,Rajeev Khanna,"Eight months after being embroiled in a sand-mining scam and ten days after his son got entangled in an Enforcement Directorate case, Punjab's power and irrigation minister Rana Gurjit Singh has put in his papers. Congress president   is expected to convey it to the state chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to accept the resignation soon and go in for a much awaited cabinet expansion This is the first major setback to the Amarinder government in Punjab and also a jolt to the Congress party that is looking for a revival on the national scene in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the path to which will have to go through Punjab as it is the only state where the party won ever since the   (BJP) came into power at the centre under  . Sources say that it was on the directions of the Congress president that Rana Gurjit put in his papers on January 4. The move is being interpreted as Rahul asserting himself in the Congress as the newly elected president of the grand old party. “He is giving the message that he is the one in control now and others will have to fall in line. Ideally, Amarinder should have asked him to quit in May itself when the sand mining scam had come to light with allegations of him bagging mining contracts through the backdoor had been leveled. But everyone knows the close bond between the two and this was not done,” said an observer. For Rahul it is pertinent to send out the right sort of political messages from this point of time as the Lok Sabha polls are barely a year away and the Congress is desperately seeking a revival across the country. Punjab is one state that the party can showcase as a model of good governance. But the opportunity has been squandered till now with not much being delivered on the public front. The Amarinder government has also not been able to optimally capitalise on the farm loan waiver that it had announced in the middle of the last year. Firstly the effort was not backed with proper political planning to take the advantage on it and secondly there have been a lot of questions on the manner of its implementation. Despite being an incomplete and a partial waiver, the Congress government under Amarinder still stands on the moral high ground in terms of being the first to deliver on the promise made even if it is a partial delivery. The governments in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra have followed with similar promises but nothing has been implemented on the ground. These are states where the BJP is in power. The opportunity to market the waiver politically still exists in the run up to the Lok Sabha polls but Amarinder needs to ensure that the government does not go on the back foot on other issues. After all he was the one who had been promising that the sand mafia would be abolished in the state once the Congress came to power. But what has happened is that only the mafia dons have changed with the change in government. There have been reports in the media almost daily pointing at the rampant illegal mining that has continued in the state across the state. This is something that the Congress as well as Amarinder cannot afford at this point of time. Another thing that is being pointed out is the non co-operation by the Punjab Congress leaders when it comes to helping the Congress units in the other poll bound states. The most recent examples have that been of Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat. In case of Himachal there were around 10 Congress leaders from the state who were listed as star campaigners but only Amarinder and the Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar went and campaigned there. Similarly there was hardly any presence from Punjab in the all important Gujarat election campaign except from former Congress chief Partap Singh Bajwa and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring. Observers feel that the party should have ensured the presence of Punjab's urban development minister   in both these states given his capacity to pull crowds. There is a point of view that accepting Rana Gurjit's resignation at this point of time would vindicate the allegations of the opposition parties Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) against the Amarinder regime. But it is better to bite the bullet for long term gains. AAP leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira who is a known Amarinder and Rana baiter had been gunning persistently for the latter's ouster over the last several months. Rana’s resignation comes as a shot in the arm for Khaira and AAP whose consistent campaign on the issue put Amarinder on the backfoot. The SAD in its statement has said now that Rana Gurjit Singh’s complicity in the sand mining scam in which sand mines were allotted to his minions, has been proven beyond doubt by his resignation, a criminal case should be registered against him for causing loss to the state exchequer. Party leader and Rajya Sabha member Balwinder Singh Bhunder said the resignation has also proved that the entire process of allocation of sand mines was flawed. ""All sand mines allocated to Congress legislators should be canceled immediately. Action should also be taken against ministers who knew about this crime and kept quiet,"" he added. ""Rana Gurjit cannot claim he is resigning on moral grounds. If that was so he should have resigned when his name surfaced in the sand mining scam in which his cook Amit Bahadur successfully bid for a Rs 26 crore sand mine,"" he added. The Akali leader further said that it has also been established that the Justice (Retired) JS Narang commission was formed to exonerate Rana Gurjit by giving it specific terms of reference. “It is clear that the Narang Commission has abysmally failed to do its job. It is now incumbent on the government to ask Justice (Retired) Narang to refund the entire money spent from the state exchequer on the bogus inquiry done by him,” he asserted.",2018-01-17,, Why Congress had to get rid of Rana Gurjit Singh in the run-up to 2019 Lok Sabha polls | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-congress-had-to-get-rid-of-rana-gurjit-singh-in-the-run-up-to-2019-lok-sabha-polls-95658.html

588,Akash Bisht,"The toughest fight amongst all these states is expected to be in Tripura where the Left Front government has been in power for the last 25 years with the incumbent chief minister Manik Sarkar looking for a fifth consecutive term. After having ruled the state for the last 25 years without much opposition, the Left Front for the first time in these many years is facing stiff competition from the BJP which has made significant inroads in the region ever since the saffron party went on to win the Assam elections in 2016. In fact, in the last few months, there has been a spurt in clashes between the supporters of the two parties which has left hundreds injured. 2017 has witnessed the highest number of political violence in the state with nearly 200 cases of clashes between various political parties leading to death of six political activists and hundreds of party offices being ransacked. Recently, on 7 January, on the day of BJP President  ’s visit to the state, BJP and CPM workers clashed leading to more than 8 people being injured. Meanwhile, Congress has become a mere spectator in these polls which reflected in how the party has been reduced to only two legislators after winning 10 seats in 2013. All these legislators have joined BJP which has become the main opposition party in the state despite not winning a single seat in 2013. In fact, Trinamool Congress had earlier taken the role of the main Opposition party after it managed to poach six of Congress legislators who later went on to join BJP. These elections are an acid test for the Left Front government which is seeking to yet again win one of the last remaining Communist bastions in India. On the ground, the ruling party faces real challenge from BJP in the plains and Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT), a tribal outfit, in the hills. IPFT has been fighting for a separate tribal state, Twipraland, for the last few decades which distanced them from BJP. However, Prime MInister   recently met an IPFT delegation who has apparently mollified the leadership on talks for a state council rather than Twipraland.  If IPFT joins hands with the BJP, it could emerge as a serious challenger to the Left Front government. If the saffron party manages to form government in Tripura, it would be a major shot in the arm for the party that till the last elections failed to win even a single seat in the state. Meanwhile, there is a lot of confusion over whether the ruling Naga People’s Front (NPF) will continue to support the BJP considering the party’s CEC had passed a resolution on 18 July to sever all ties with the BJP. The NPF leadership was increasingly getting wary of BJP trying to form its own government in the state much like it did in Arunachal Pradesh. One of the oldest anti-Congress parties, NPF first reached a political understanding with the Janata Party in 1977. This laid the foundation for the party’s friendship with BJP in the years to come. However, BJP has been hinting at having an alliance with a new regional party, Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP), and it became clear after three time chief minister and NPF leader Neiphu Rio quit the party. It is likely that he could join NDPP and be the joint chief minister candidate. Moreover, there is a leadership tussle within the NPF with incumbent chief minister TR Zeliang and former chief minister Shurhozelie Leizeitsu. Latter is of the opinion that BJP is trying to break NPF while Zeilang is a BJP sympathiser. BJP wanted Zeliang to join the party but he denied citing how the saffron party would not be able to win many seats in the Christian dominated state. Meanwhile, NPF leadership suggested the possibility of the July decision of severing ties with BJP being reviewed later by the CEC. Much of BJP’s and NPF’s prospects would depend on the decision of the CEC which is likely to shape the state politics in the days to come. However, a split would become imminent if the party severs ties with BJP which will charge up the political scene in the state. Another Christian dominated state that goes to poll is Meghalaya where Congress would hope to form the government for yet another term. The BJP has successfully managed to make inroads into the Congress bastions in the North-East, having won Assam and Manipur and conducting a political coup in Arunachal Pradesh. However, its juggernaut might hit a roadblock in poll-bound Meghalaya. Here the Christian community, which forms over 70% of the state’s population, is apprehensive about the BJP due to the attack on minorities in other parts of the country, in particular the attack on carol singers in Madhya Pradesh and the violence by cow vigilantes across India. Christians feel the BJP could try to saffronise the state by interfering in their food habits and pushing their Hindutva agenda. This could be a major deterrent for the Christian voters who might even avoid voting for other Opposition parties like NPP that are part of the North-East Democratic Alliance. The main fight in Meghalaya is said to be between the Congress and National People’s Party (NPP), headed by former Lok Sabha Speaker PA Sangma’s son Conrad Sangma. With a spike in incidents of attacks on Christians across the country, the fate of Congress and Opposition parties would depend on who the majority community votes for. However, political analysts do not rule out the possibility of a Manipur-like situation where BJP formed the government despite Congress emerging as the single largest party. There is a possibility of BJP entering into an alliance with other regional parties and wooing Congress MLAs and independents to its fold to deliver yet another blow to the grand old party that is slowly losing its political relevance in the region.The Election Commission on Thursday announced the dates for the two phased Assembly elections in the north eastern states of Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland. The voters in Tripura would exercise their franchise on 18 February while elections will be held in Nagaland and Meghalaya on 27 February. The much-anticipated polls come at a time when the BJP is looking to expand its presence in the North-East where the saffron party and its allies have governments in three states. With these elections, BJP is hoping to increase the tally to six states which would be a major boost for the party in the run up to the 2019 General Elections. These elections are also an acid test for the Congress which is hoping to regain Meghalalya where BJP has been making significant inroads by poaching several sitting MLAs and prominent Christian figures. In the remaining two states, Congress does not have much stake but it would still want to end as the second largest party.",2018-01-18,," EC announces polls in Meghalaya, Nagaland & Tripura: Here’s a look at the battlegrounds  | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/ec-announces-polls-in-meghalaya-nagaland-tripura-here-s-a-look-at-the-battlegrounds-95788.html

592,Rajeev Khanna,"The Congress party in Haryana has enough ammunition on hands to take on the Manohar Lal Khattar led   (BJP) government in the state. It is effectively capitalising on the opportunity being presented to it by the Khattar regime’s ineptitude but the catch here is that the Congress in moving ahead as a divided house and this may bring self inflicted debacle in the long run. Haryana is one of the states that is presenting a window of opportunity to the Congress make political gains in the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls scheduled for the next year. It is a peculiar scenario that can be witnessed with regards to the Congress in the state. To begin with the All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for the state Kamal Nath has been missing from the scene for several months now. He has hardly made an appearance in the party headquarters in Chandigarh or on the ground in the state. The general perception at this point of time is that he would be more concerned about the forthcoming assembly polls in his home turf of Madhya Pradesh than Haryana.  On the ground it is both the rival factions led by the former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and the state unit chief Ashok Tanwar who are engaged in a competition of sorts when it comes to reaching out to the public. The Hooda camp had been demanding that the affairs of the state Congress be placed in the hands of Hooda or one of his loyalists by removing Tanwar from the post. But the recent message coming from party president   that there is no move to change the party heads in the states, has emboldened the Tanwar group. Not only did the group celebrate, it has gone into the exercise of giving a new look to the various cells of the party and also putting in place new organisation heads at the local level.  Tanwar recently began with the recasting of the legal cell of the state Congress that had been lying defunct for a long time. This was seen as an act of assertion by his faction as the 26-member executive body of the legal cell under Naveen Sharma is packed with Tanwar loyalists with a very few Hooda followers.  The Hooda followers however see Rahul's message as a temporary arrangement till the time Rahul is well settled in his new post of the Congress president. In fact Hooda demonstrated a show of strength last week when he hosted a lunch for AICC and Haryana leaders. The only prominent faces who were reportedly missing at the event were Tanwar, Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Kiran Chaudhary and Randeep Surjewala. ,  Over the last few months Hooda has held a series of Kisan and Dalit panchayats reaching out to the farmers and the marginalised sections of the society and attacking the BJP regime in the state. He along with the other Congress leaders has now stepped up the attacks on the issue of the prevailing dismal law and order situation in the state particularly with the glaring instances of rape coming to light on daily basis. He has also announced a Rath Yatra that is to be taken out in the coming days. Tanwar on the other hand also has plans to carry out Cycle Yatras besides organising Manthan Shivirs. He has also announced plans to gherao Khattar and BJP's national president   in the days to come. But the main challenge for central leadership of the Congress would be to bring these warring factions on a common platforms if the Congress is keen to form the next government in the state.  “The people in the state are very disillusioned with the present regime. The Jats that form a major chunk of the electorate, have made up their minds to vote one sided. If they see Hooda as the Congress leader they will rally behind the Congress otherwise they have the option of rallying behind the Chautala family of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD),” points out veteran political analyst Balwant Takshak.  Takshak further points out that Kiran Chaudhary is another leader who stands at an advantage amid Congress factionalism. “Given her family background she is one of the contenders for the chief ministerial post if the Congress comes into power. She will have to present herself as the potential candidate to the electorate on her home turf in Bhiwani. If she stands with Hooda at this point of time she will be not seen as a potential candidate for the top post but as a Hooda supporter. In any case if Hooda gets the top post she always has the chance to be among the top leaders in the state cabinet,” he added. Tanwar and Chaudhary met Rahul on Friday where they have reportedly requested him to hold a rally in Haryana soon. A good public rally in the state would spell the launch the Congress campaign in the state. The opportunity in Haryana is something that the Congress cannot afford to lose. With the Khattar regime standing out as a poor performer, there are enough issues at hand to put it down on the mat. ",2018-01-20,, Haryana: Congress has Khattar on the mat but its own house isn’t in order | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/haryana-congress-has-khattar-on-the-mat-but-its-own-house-isn-t-in-order-95995.html

595,Rajeev Khanna,"“The efforts in this direction were started last year, when we set up this front enrolling volunteers who were neither affiliated with any religious institution, nor any political party, and were also not a paid employee of any social organization,” explains senior MCCG functionary Mujahid Nafees.     “The exercise was triggered by our analysis of the status report of the Union Ministry of Minority Affairs, when we found that, out of the 27 schemes meant for the minorities, only three had been initiated in Gujarat, and this included allocation of a mere Rs 55 lakh for rural housing and Rs 70 lakh for upgradation of some institution. There was a big zero against other schemes like skill development, starting of self-help groups, etc.,” he points out.   Speaking of the same report, Nafees recounts that, at the state level, there was no specific allocation for Muslims in the state budget, while the Rs 55 lakh that was allocated was to the clubbed category of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Castes and minorities. This paltry amount becomes even smaller when compared with the annual state budget of Rs 1,76,000 crore. This blatant apathy from the state government is what pushed the MCCG to act.“We decided to start a movement to ensure that we must avail what is constitutionally our right,” Nafees stated.   A three-month drive was launched, under which one lakh post cards listing the demands of the minorities were addressed to Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. Though there was no formal response from the government, there were enough telephonic calls from officials making promises.     “Our biggest achievement was that Rupani had to talk about what his government proposed to do for Muslims in the presence of Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on 29 August. This was the first time that the state government was talking about Muslims in a poll year,” says Nafees. Following this, the MCCG made representations to the district collectors simultaneously across the state on 18 September. Thereafter came the model code of conduct and the polls. Now the move has gained pace with this fresh signature campaign.   The representation, signed by members of the Muslim community, points out that Muslims account for 9.7 percent of the state, and 82.3 percent Muslim children take admission in primary schools, but this figure comes down to a mere 32.5 percent by the time they reach matriculation level.   The representation says that Gujarat has witnessed large scale internal migration for years following the 2002 riots and subsequent establishment of industries on the coast. These two lakh people are now living in slums in cities without the minimum basic amenities.   “In Gujarat, we have no separate ministry for minority affairs, no budget allocation for the upliftment of minorities in state budget, no implementation of schemes started by the government of India. There is no grievance redressal mechanism for minorities in Gujarat in the form of a commission,” it underlines.   The main demands raised by the community is the formation of a ministry for the welfare of minorities in the state, making specific financial provisions in the state budget for development of minorities, and opening of government higher secondary schools in areas where minorities reside, such as Juhapura, Naroda, Shah Alam, and Jamalpur areas of Ahmedabad.   There is another demand seeking parity between certificates of madrasas and those given by the Gujarat Board of School Education. The Muslims are further asking for a state minorities commission after passing of a law by the state assembly that gives it a constitutional status.   The representation further asks for the community to be provided with a special financial package and a policy formed for the rehabilitation of persons who have been internally displaced because of natural disasters and communal violence.   “Our aim is to generate the self-confidence among the educated youth of the community to avail what the Constitution has provided for them using political and democratic means. The community and its issues have to be brought back to the democratic political narrative of the state. This is something that has vanished from the political discourse,” says Nafees. In the recent assembly elections, the BJP tried to sell its development narrative while the Congress countered it on its failures over the last two decades. Simultaneously, there were attempts to polarise voters on communal grounds, but this never became the main narrative of the campaign.   The Congress, on the other hand, did not talk at all about Muslims, lest Hindu voters see it as pro-Muslim. This was so pronounced that even senior Muslim leaders from the state, such as Ahmed Patel, were not seen campaigning. On one occasion, when social activist Gagan Sethi referred to the insecurity among the Muslims before Congress president  , the latter made a generalised promise that the Congress would ensure safety of all when it came to power. The Muslims also kept quiet during the entire campaign. Some saw this as tactical silence, while others interpret it as disillusionment.   It is amid such a scenario that an initiative like the one being executed by the MCCG assumes significance, because the complete whitewashing of a community from the political landscape of the state is definitely not a good sign for the days to come. After all, if this status quo is maintained it will only lead to more inequality and insecurity.The recently concluded assembly elections in Gujarat saw the culmination of a process that has seen minorities being banished from the political narrative in the state. This came as an irony of sorts, because since the 2002 assembly polls that were held in a communally polarised atmosphere following the Godhra train burning and the subsequent anti-Muslim pogrom, minorities always found reference in the political narrative. However, in the recent polls, even the Congress did not mention minorities for fear of losing majority votes.     Now, a new drive is underway in Gujarat to bring minorities and their issues back into the mainstream political narrative. Under this initiative, there is a plan to send at least one lakh individually signed representations by the Muslim community members to the state government by 14 February. This initiative was launched on 15 January under the banner of the Minority Co-ordination Committee Gujarat (MCCG). A follow up event was held this past   in Bhuj to give added impetus to the movement.",2018-01-22,," Banished from the mainstream, a campaign is on in Gujarat to give Muslims a voice again | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/banished-from-the-mainstream-a-campaign-is-on-in-gujarat-to-give-muslims-a-voice-again-96241.html
596,Anurag Dey,"The hearing of petitions concerning the mysterious death of CBI judge BH Loya, witnessed heated arguments between senior advocates Dushyant Dave and Harish Salve. A Chief Justice Dipak Misra headed bench on Monday began hearing the two petitions seeking independent probe into the death of Loya who was then hearing the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case in which BJP chief   was the prime accused. Within a month of Loya’s death, Shah in December 2014 was discharged by the CBI Court on grounds of insufficient evidence.   Curiously, the CBI which had indicted Shah of being a “part of the larger conspiracy to kill Sohrabuddin, subsequently his wife Kauser Bi and and finally Tulsiram Prajapati, did not challenge Shah’s discharge. Filed by Maharashtra-based journalist Banduraj Sambhaji Lone and Congress leader Tehseen Poonawalla, the petitions follow reports by   about Loya’s family members suspecting foul play and making shocking revelations including a bribe offer of Rs 100 crore in return for a favourable judgment made by a top judge. Two similar petitions including one filed by the Bombay Lawyers’ Association, are pending before the Bombay High Court.   Representing the petitioners, Dave opposed Salve’s appearance in favour Maharashtra, citing conflict of interest.  “He (Salve) has appeared for Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin case and now is appearing for Maharashtra. This is a serious conflict of interest,” contended Dave. Dave’s contentions ensued into a heated exchange of words between the two senior counsels prompting the bench to intervene.    “Please do not cast aspersions or comment on such things. We all are the holders of our own conscience. It is for the advocates to decide whether or not they should appear in any matter,” said the bench.   Salve had appeared for Amit Shah in 2016, opposing a petition challenging his discharge in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case. He had also defended the Gujarat government in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case. Conflict of interest allegations have also been made against advocate Pallav Shishodia who is representing one of the petitioners in the Loya case. He had earlier appeared for Shah in 2011 against the CBI challenging his bail in the Sohrabuddin case.    Apprising the court about the petitions before the Bombay High Court, Dave said document supplied in respect of the matter by the Maharashtra government were incomplete and sought access to postmortem and other medical report. He also claimed to have information obtained through RTI that contradict the Maharashtra government’s assertions of Loya having died due to cardiac arrest. He also pointed to the demands made by Loya’s father and sister for an independent probe into the judge’s sudden and mysterious death. Dave also submitted that some documents have not been brought on record. They may have a bearing on the case, and are hence required to be filed. Strongly contesting Dave’s arguments, Salve appearing for the Maharashtra government, said a careful and prudent investigation was conducted following the media reports in which four judicial officers rejected any foul play. “It contains statements from judicial officers who were accompanying Judge Loya as to the entire sequence of events leading to his death. All these are sitting judicial officers who have given these statements under their signature,” said Salve adding that the Bombay High Court recorded the statements that said Justice Loya died of cardiac arrest.  The bench observed “We must look into all documents with utmost seriousness"" and ordered all records pertaining to the case be before it.   It also directed transferring the petitions case pending in the Bombay High Court to itself and restrained other High Courts from dealing with the matter. Following the court’s order to produce all documents, Salve pleaded that the documents be shared only amongst lawyers involved in the case prompting severe objection from advocates Dave and Indira Jaising.   Jaising, representing one of the petitioners, said accepting Salve’s plea would tantamount to gagging the media. “The entire system is trying to protect one man. Amit Shah and Amit Shah alone is the beneficiary. The nation has the right to know. There should be no gag”. Displeased by the remarks, CJI Misra demanded Jaising to withdraw her submission and apologise. The senior advocate promptly withdrew her submission and apologised.

He said the VHP, Bajrang Dal and other Hindu organisations should not let the film release in the country. Talking to reporters at the Jaipur International Airport, Togadia demanded that the Centre bring an ordinance to ban the film's release as it did with regard to the Supreme Court order in the 'Jallikattu' case. ""If it does not happen then people should take part in 'Janta curfew' to not let the film release,"" he added.

598,Ashwin Aghor,"Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut moved the proposal to contest future elections independently, and the motion was passed unanimously. Raut alleged that the   (BJP) had been working to finish the Shiv Sena for the last three years, and that it was time to show the party's real strength. He expressed that the Shiv Sena will win a minimum of 25 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 polls, and 125 Assembly seats in Maharashtra, if it contested independently. This, however, was only making official what Uddhav Thackeray had said during the campaign for Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) elections. At that time, Thackeray had announced that the party will not enter into an alliance with any political party in future. Addressing the national executive, Uddhav Thackeray came down heavily on the BJP. Taking a pot shot at Modi's 56-inch chest boast, Thackeray said it was not the size of the chest that mattered, as one has to be brave from within. “Instead of doing a road show in Ahmedabad with the Israeli Prime Minister,   should have shown his 56-inch chest by doing a road show at Lal Chowk in Srinagar. The armed forces are real heroes, not the Prime Minister,” Thackeray said. He also criticised BJP leader and Union minister   over his statements demeaning the Navy. While the Shiv Sena shows a brave face, other political parties, including the BJP, seem to have written it off. Talking to a news agency, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is in Davos, Switzerland, said, “Shiv Sena has been saying a lot of things over the past three years. Still we are in alliance. The government will complete its term of five years.” Senior journalist and political analyst Kumar Ketkar, however, has lauded the decision. “This is a brave move and Shiv Sena will benefit from it. It is likely to emerge stronger in the future. However, the split will not have any impact on the performance of the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) even if they form an alliance in 2019,” Ketkar said. Veteran political analyst Ganesh Torsekar, though, feels otherwise. According to him, the Shiv Sena has entered into self-destruction mode, and will pay a heavy price for it in years to come. “It is utterly mindless on the part of Uddhav Thackeray to make the announcement. He should have had a look at the different surveys published over last fortnight. According to them, the vote share of Shiv Sena is likely to come down to 10% from 19.5% in 2014. If true, this is a major loss for a party which is hoping to dominate the politics of the state on its own. In my opinion, it will not be able to even win two Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Whatever it got in 2014 was simply because of the Modi wave, which was seen in Assembly elections held immediately after that, and the MCGM elections last year. Uddhav could not even consolidate his position in Mumbai,” he said. Torsekar criticised the Thackerays for confining themselves to Mumbai. “During the recently conducted civic body elections across the state, despite being CM, Fadnavis toured every city and town for campaigning. On the other hand, Uddhav didn’t venture out of Mumbai. It is the biggest disadvantage of Thackerays that they are limited to Mumbai, Pune and Nashik. Uddhav should first gain some ground in Maharashtra, and then aim to spread at the national level,” Torsekar said. Referring to Uddhav’s critisism of BJP over its alliance with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Jammu and Kashmir, Torsekar said, “If there is PDP on one side of the BJP, Shiv Sena is on the other. Uddhav has no moral right to criticise the BJP for having an alliance with PDP as long he is not only with NDA, but sharing the government at state as well as Centre.” Congress spokesperson Sachin Savant said, “Thackerays have lost credibility. Uddhav has created a record of threatening to resign from the government. He only threatens but never executes the threat. As a result, Shiv Sena has become a laughing stock in the political circles of Maharashtra. We will decide our future strategy soon.” Speaking in a similar vein, NCP leader Ajit Pawar said that, though Thackeray has announced that the Shiv Sena will independently contest 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, he has no courage to walk out of the government at the Centre or state level.  ""This is not the real Shiv Sena. If Uddhav Thackeray has decided to contest elections independently, he should ask all his ministers to resign from both state and central governments. But he will never do it, because he doesn't want to give up the perks of being in the government,"" Pawar said.In a major step that will have a long-lasting impact on politics of Maharashtra, the   has decided to contest all future elections on its own. Party chief   announced this decision at the national executive meeting of the party held at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Complex in Worli, Mumbai.

599,Charu Kartikeya,"The EC itself ordinarily takes due caution in handling matters regarding disqualification of elected representatives. In June last year, it disqualified a sitting MLA and a minister in the Madhya Pradesh government for a malpractice he indulged in in the previous polls. Narottam Mishra was  for paying for news coverage and not reporting it to the EC. EC is often criticised for delay in acting on such complaints, but what works in EC's defence is that due caution must be exercised before disqualifying a representative elected by lakhs of voters. Each of the 20 AAP MLAs represented a lakh or more voters and their party was sent to the Delhi Assembly with an unprecedented mandate. The least that the EC could have done to respect that mandate is to have given the MLAs a proper hearing. This hold true for President Kovind as well. As the final arbiter in the case and as the fountainhead of India's constitutional setup, he ought to have taken time to consider the EC's opinion and weigh its pros and cons.

The EC took over two years to formulate its opinion on the original petition, referred to it by the President, but submitted it quietly on the last working day of the retiring chief election commissioner. President Kovind made matters worse by displaying haste in dealing with the case and promptly disqualified the legislators. Key decisions like these are rarely taken on weekends, but Kovind issued orders on a Saturday and they were made public on a Sunday. Now, the newly promoted CEC, Om Prakash Rawat, is fiercely contesting the allegation that the EC did not give the MLAs a hearing.

600,Catch Team,"The National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) Tuesday evening came out openly against holding Assembly elections in Nagaland due February 27. “ “ “The insurgent outfit, which is negotiating a final settlement of the Naga issue, has acknowledged the many voices calling for “solution not election”. Apparently, the outfit is not on board for  the  polls. The decision taken by the GoI / Election Commission of India to hold election is bound to undermine the progress of the ongoing talks between the NSCN and the GoI and become a serious obstacle towards finding an early political solution,” a press release from NSCN (IM)’s ministry of information and publicity, said on Tuesday. The Naga rebel group’s firm stand is backed by  non-government organisations  and civil society organisations, including Naga Hoho, and even anti-corruption platform ACAUT. These and many more have said they want “solution before election”. NSCN (IM) has stopped short of using the word “boycott” of the polls, but has minced no words in criticism. “Imposition of such election is not acceptable to the Naga people who are for an early negotiated political settlement,” the NSCN (IM) has asserted. But it has not stopped at that. It has trained its guns on the   ( BJP )  itself, with which it has  had  an amiable relationship over the past two years after signing of the framework agreement in August 2015. We need a government that will be helpful in concluding the Naga agreement, which we want to conclude with all seriousness,” BJP  G eneral  S ecretary Ram Madhav said in Dimapur on Monday. The NSCN (IM) has not accepted this election promise for a settlement post-election. Therefore, those who advocate for the imposed election does not stand for the interest of the Naga people. We are seriously critical with such people or group as they do not contribute towards finding lasting political solution,” said the NSCN statement. It appears the BJP’s promise for facilitating a solution is seen by the NSCN as another  . The NSCN said it has issued a statement in “(Naga) national interest” to inform the Naga people in general on the issue of election in Nagaland. The outfit said it is committed for an early negotiated political settlement that is honorable to both India and the Nagas. Earlier in the statement it said the Nagas have sincerely come very close for political solution, appreciating the steps taken by the  Centre  in seeking political solution and leaving aside military solution. However, it made it clear that NSCN “sincerely appreciates” the stand and wish of the Naga people for an early political solution and no election. ""We, therefore, reiterate our position for an early political solution that will usher in peace in the whole subcontinent and the GoI must exercise political will to take steps accordingly.

602,Aditya Menon,"The Left’s uninterrupted stint in power since 1993 often makes outside observers forget the fact that Tripura has always had a strong Opposition vote. Since 1983, when the Left Front first came to power in the state, the Congress and its allied party which represented Tripura’s indigenous communities have consistently secured over 40% of the total vote share. In 1988, the Congress under the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi even managed to defeat the Left Front. The Congress won 25 of the 46 seats it contested and its ally, the Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti (TUS) won seven out of 14. At that time, Gandhi enjoyed a brute majority in the Lok Sabha. The Northeast was a special area of focus for Gandhi, under whom the Assam Accord and Mizo Accord were signed, bringing stability to the two insurgency-affected states. “Rajiv Gandhi was the only leader with the vision and will to take on the Left in Tripura. After his death, the Congress weakened nationally. It often had to take the Left’s help in the Centre. This weakened it in Tripura,” says a senior Tripura Congress functionary on the condition of anonymity. What has emboldened the ‘Virodh Paksh’ voters is that under  , BJP is appearing as a party which has the national might as well as the hunger to defeat the Left in Tripura, much like Rajiv Gandhi’s Congress. Modi is the first prime minister since Gandhi to have a single party majority in the Lower House. His focus on the Northeast, is evident from the Centre’s agreement with Naga outfit NSCN(IM) as well as the formation of BJP governments in Assam, Manipur  and Arunachal Pradesh. As an acknowledgement of the BJP emerging as the main Opposition force, the dominant tribal party the Indegenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) has entered into an alliance with the saffron party, much like its predecessors did with the Congress. However, for the BJP to even come close to defeating the Left, it would need to ensure a complete wipeout of the Congress. But this is easier said than done. “A party whose vote share (including allies) has never gone below 40%, cannot be completely wiped out this easily. Watch out for older voters, who have voted Congress for so many decades. They won’t ditch the party,” the senior Congress functionary said. On the ground, this reality is being felt by BJP workers. Sanjib, a BJP worker, looks angrily at crowd at the Congress office in the Badharghat constituency in Agartala. “The bigger the crowd there, the better the chances are for the Left. And this is supposed to be an Opposition seat,” he says. Badharghat is one of the seats where BJP fancies its chances.  The sitting MLA Dilip Sarkar, who won on a Congress ticket in 1988, 1998, 2008 and 2013, is now contesting from the BJP. Dhirendra Saha, who runs a tea stall in Badharghat, says that the division of votes between Congress and BJP could create an opening for the Left. “Some Congress workers in the area left with Sarkar, but some stayed back.  The anti-Left votes might get divided. Dilip Sarkar could lose, I feel,” he says. In Banmalipur in the heart of Agartala and Kailashahar in Tripura West, the situation is the reverse. Here a section of workers have shifted to the BJP but the MLAs are still with the Grand Old Party and have a personal connect with the voters. Birajit Sinha, presently the state Congress chief, has represented Kailashahar five times since 1988, losing only once in the Left wave of 1993.  The case of Banamalipur is similar as Congress hasn’t lost the seat since 1983. It is represented by three-time MLA Gopal Chandra Roy, who is also the Congress Legislative Party leader. “It is a tough choice for anti-Left voters, whether to choose the person or the party. Gopal Chandra Roy is a respected person here,” said Binod, a shopkeeper in Banamalipur Sanjib, however, consider Banmalipur a “sure seat” for the party.  “Gopalbabu is a good man. But there’s no one with him. We shall surely win the seat,” predicts Sanjib, who is equally confident of BJP winning in his area Badharghat. He is interrupted by an auto-rickshaw playing Lata Mangeshkar’s ‘Vande Mataram’ on a loud speaker, He stops talking to listen to the song and gets up to take a look at the auto as it passes, only to see that it is Congress campaign vehicle.Suman Deb has the tone of a loyal footsoldier let down by his generals, whenever he speaks about the Congress. “I worked for the party for 30 years, since I was a young boy. We braved every challenge and fought the Left Front here in Tripura. But what did the party do? They allied with the same Left Front in West Bengal. Where does that leave us?” Deb asks. In 2016, the year Congress and the Left fought as allies in the West Bengal Assembly elections, Deb was was among the hundreds of Congress workers in Tripura who left the Congress and joined the   (BJP). “Some of them also joined Trinamool Congress back then. But now even they have come to the BJP,” Deb says. Deb is now working for the BJP in the Badharghat SC reserved constituency in the southern end of Agartala. Sitting in a BJP booth along with 20 other party workers, Deb says, “All of us sitting here were in the Congress earlier. Now we are in the BJP”. “We belong to the Virodh Paksh (Opposition) in Tripura. Earlier Virodh Paksh meant Congress, now it is BJP. Our only ideology is anti-CPM,” says Nityanand Saha, another party worker seated with Deb. However, ideology and the Congress’ alliance with the Left in 2016 aren’t the only factors that drove party workers away. Several workers who have switched side said that funds had significantly dried up after the Congress’ defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Initially, it was the Trinamool Congress under Mukul Roy which came with the promise of a stronger anti-Left campaign and more funds. Now it is the BJP. Asked about the difference between the Congress’ and BJP’s organisation, Deb says, “discipline is the key in BJP. If we have been given a position, we have to remain in that position, not try to occupy a much higher rank”. The main question that will determine the BJP’s prospects in Tripura is whether the party manages to get the entire anti-Left Front vote that completely went to the Congress until the last Assembly elections.",2018-02-05,, Tripura polls: Only a ‘Congress Mukt Tripura’ can help BJP defeat Left Front | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/tripura-polls-only-a-congress-mukt-tripura-can-help-bjp-defeat-left-front-98113.html
603,Rajeev Khanna,"Just over a month into the saddle and the stamp of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanhg (RSS) is pretty visible on the functioning of the Jairam Thakur-led   (BJP) government in Himachal Pradesh. The hill state is the latest addition to other BJP-ruled states where the RSS is calling the shots and the functioning is keenly being monitored from the BJP headquarters in Delhi. To begin with, the people of the state are pointing to the Officers on Special Duty (OSDs) appointed both in the office of the chief minister as well as those appointed by the ministers. There are three OSDs in the chief minister's office calling the shots while some others are working for different ministers. These are people with strong Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and RSS grooming. The locals have started complaining of these people acting as firewalls and stonewalling the access to the chief minister and the ministers. “Only those whom these people want can go and meet the top political leadership while the rest are denied the access. This was never the case in both the previous Virbhadra Singh-led Congress government and the Prem Kumar Dhumal-led BJP governments. This is a new culture being established,” pointed a senior media professional who has been covering the state administration for almost two decades in Shimla. “ “ “ “ Another issue that can be expected to snowball into a contentious political battle is the controversy over the government decision to close certain colleges and look into the school upgradations that were carried out during the fag end of the Congress regime. The present government has been pointing that these colleges were opened with pure political motives with no staff and very small budget allocation. Hence they would serve no purpose. But at the same time Thakur announcing a new college for Jawali in Kangra on February 2 has raised a big question mark over his government's stand on this issue. Observers also point that the functioning of this government is being keenly monitored from Delhi which gives weightage to the theory that this would be another remote control run administration of BJP's National President   and Prime Minister   just like the one in the neighbouring state of Haryana. Thakur has been meeting Union minister Jagat Prakash Nadda who hails from Himachal Pradesh apprising him of the developments in the state whenever he has been visiting Delhi. Recently Nadda had organised a lunch for all the Himachal cadre officials posted in Delhi and it was a made a point to publicize the event in the media. Sources say that the new Chief Secretary Vineet Chaudhary is also close to Nadda. Observers say that these are just indication of bigger things to come before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Whether it will benefit the BJP in the long run remains to be seen.Things have already come to a pass where the strains between the BJP workers from non RSS backgrounds and those who have risen through the RSS grooming have started becoming visible with the former feeling ignored. This is being expressed in sarcastic undertones. It is not just the OSDs who are ensuring that the RSS is having a grip over the administration but even the officials down the bureaucracy have started expressing that they are wary of certain faceless elements among them reporting the minutest of things up the ladder.  The bureaucracy to a major extent has been aligned in the state either with the Congress and the BJP and this normally leads to the transfers to key posts of favourites whenever there is a change of guard. But the difference this time is the fear that is getting instilled in the officials who politically differ with the dispensation in power.  The officials are wary that even the smallest of their actions would be reported to unknown quarters and there can be many unexpected ramifications,” pointed a political observer based in Shimla. All this is doing the rounds despite Thakur having asserted time and again that his government is not going to be vindictive towards anyone. The state has been in for a surprise at the exceptionally high number of transfer that have been taking place in the little more than one month that this government has been in power.  Can you imagine that there were 102 transfers ordered in a single day in a small state like Himachal Pradesh. One can understand the transfers at key posts at top level but this is across the board,” pointed a local media person. Questions are also being raised at the 'double talk' of the government on issues like austerity. The people were surprised at the government coming out with a notification on appointment of a media advisor to the chief minister at a monthly emolument of Rs 1.44 lakh when there is a very efficient public relations department functioning in the state.  Just like other states, this is being seen as a tool to oblige a favourite among the local media. Similarly the people are questioning the creation of two additional posts in the Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission (HPPSC) one of which is yet to be filled.  Sources say that with about only 1,000 posts to be filled through this commission in a year, even the earlier strength was more than that required. Sources say that there is hardly any work that would require the services of more members at fat salaries.  But this is once again a move to oblige some 'favourites'. In fact there is much surprise being expressed at the RSS not stepping in to check these post creations or having their own cadre posted against these posts.",2018-02-05,, RSS starts putting its stamp on Jairam Thakur govt in Himachal | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/rss-starts-putting-its-stamp-on-jairam-thakur-govt-in-himachal-98167.html
604,Aditya Menon,"The Left Front is sparing no effort to preserve its citadel Tripura in the face of a rising   (BJP).  Several national leaders and all the state leaders of the Left Front constituents are constantly on the campaign trail. Communist Party of India (Marxist) Politburo member Brinda Karat has been travelling across Tripura for the past few weeks, addressing public meetings. Catch spoke to Karat after her meeting at Mandaibazar constituency in Tripura West. A constituency reserved for Scheduled Tribes, Mandaibazar falls under the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTADC). Karat says that her focus over the past few weeks has been to address small meetings in the Assembly seats that lie in the TTADC. A former secretary of the All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA), Karat attaches special focus to women in her public meetings. In Tripura’s tribal areas, women play an important role in mobilising support for all the political parties. They even take positions that are at odds with the male members of their respective parties. The most important example of this is the decision of the women’s wing of the Indegenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) to put up 20 candidates in the state independent of the party’s decision to contest just nine seats as BJP’s junior partner. Throughout her address in Mandaibazar and Patnipara on Sunday as well as in her conversation with Catch, Karat attacked the IPFT and BJP for threatening the stability of Tripura. She says that women in particular are firm that they do not want to go back to the era of instability in Tripura, referring to the turbulence of the 1980s and 1990s. She also criticised Prime Minister   saying that “only  ’s son Jay Shah has prospered while lakhs of youth remain unemployed”. Here are a few excerpts from the conversation with Brinda Karat:  As a rule, we don’t underestimate anyone. The BJP appears to have succeeded in occupying the space left by the Congress in Tripura. But we are confident that this won’t harm the Left Front in any way. The work we have done speaks for itself.  The BJP has no roots in Tripura. It is entirely relying on leaders and cadres imported from the Congress. Their campaign is based on opportunism. They have no vision for Tripura. However, I must say that the BJP has pumped in huge money in their Tripura campaign. This is unprecedented. Such a show of money has never happened before in any election in Tripura. They are trying to make up for their lack of cadres by throwing in more money.  I want to know what is that they want to change. Do they want to change Tripura’s culture of tolerance and pluralism? Do they want to change our policies that are aimed at the welfare of the poor? Do they want to do away with the rights of farmers, tribals, women, minorities, etc?  The BJP’s hypocrisy is most blatant in the tribal areas. On one hand, it makes big promises to the people of Tripura, on the other hand it goes allies with an extremist party like IPFT which has only spread violence and instability in the state.  Look at the murder of journalist Shantanu Bhowmick. Or the protests  and blockade by IPFT last year, which harmed the people. It is quite clear that IPFT’s blockade had BJP’s blessings as well.  The IPFT too needs to be called out for its alliance with BJP. How can it call itself “indigenous” and align with a party that talks of Aryavarta and Gharwapsi.  Modi’s popularity is on the wane. The Gujarat elections and the recent bypolls in Rajasthan have shown that BJP’s support is reducing with each passing day.  This is a battle for Tripura’s pluralism. This is a state where people who speak different languages, belong to different religions and caste groups, reside. It is a state where the government pursues policies for the welfare of all citizens.

607,Neeraj Thakur,"On  6  February, 2013,   mesmeri s ed the youth of India with his hour-long speech delivered at one of  India's  most coveted colleges. Many observers believe it was from the platform of Sri Ram College of Commerce  (SRCC) , that Modi kickstarted his campaign for  being the  Prime Minister.  He  projected himself as  a  man of new ideas who can transform the future of India's 430 million  youth  (15-43 year old).  He said:  “65% of (India's) population is below 35 years of age. Europe has grown old, China is old, but India is young. Unfortunately, we have not been able to harness such a big demographic opportunity.”  Modi's speech worked like a magic wand for the 120.53 million first time voters in the 2014 election who played a crucial role in handing him the most dominant mandate in the history of electoral policits in India.  But, on  5  February, 2018, exactly  five  years after Modi's SRCC speech, his man Friday   in his first address as the Rajya Sabha member glorified the job of selling  ' Pakodas'. “Selling pakodas is not a shameful job, calling someone who does that a beggar is,” Shah said.  Shah's speech was targeted at former finance minister P Chidambaram, who equated the job of selling Pakodas with that of begging.  Chidambaram had recently made fun of Prime Minister Modi for arguing in a  TV  interview that Mudra loans given by  h is government were helping people become self-employed.  While Shah is right in saying that selling Pakoda is better than begging, his proposition is ridiculous pitched against the dreams Modi sold to the youth of the nation.  In his SRCC speech, Modi talked about 31 new-age universities that his government had opened during his reign in Gujarat. Those 31 universities, according to Modi, equipped the youth for modern-day jobs. From teaching forensic science to management of internal and external security of the country, Modi talked about education in his state as a game changer for the youth of India.  While Shah called joblessness in India a legacy issue, government data tabled by finance ministry in Parliament says bad debt, went up by 47% from Rs 3,536 crore at the end of March 2015 to Rs 5,192 crore on  31  March, 2017.  Those who take student loans to study, do not aspire to become Pakoda sellers. They dream of taking up white-collar jobs with  five- digit salary to be able to repay their loans.  These are the students who worked hard during their school years believing that higher education is a life changing force that can change the fortunes of even the sons and daughters of Pakoda sellers.  More than a 10 lakh people enter the job market every month in India but not more than 50,000 are absorbed in the Indian economy. All others, have to take up either menial jobs or they are forced to sit at home.  In his elections campaign, Modi had promised  two  crore jobs in  five  years. Surprisingly, the job creation promises by Modi were backed by some grand plans. He made youth believe that those studying in universities will be absorbed as architects in 100 smart cities, as engineers in India's manufacturing sector, and as service providers in India hospitality and financial sectors.  Unfortunately, non of those grand schemes have been successful in the first  four  years of Modi government. The farm sector, traditionally the biggest job provider to India's population, too, has grown by less than 2% so far. And this despite good rainfall in  three  out of  four  years of Modi rule.  While Shah, Modi and others in the current government like to blame the previous government for all the problems of the country, in doing so, they are insulting the great mandate given to them by Indian voters.  Four years may not be enough to fix all the problems of the past, but one fails to understand why those problems have increased manyfold under the new government? ",2018-02-06,, Amit Shah's Rajya Sabha debut speech let down for those who believed Modi's SRCC speech | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/amit-shah-rajya-sabha-debut-speech-let-down-for-those-who-believed-modi-s-srcc-speech-98302.html
608,Riyaz Wani,"At 3.30 pm on January 10, Asifa Bano, an eight year old Bakerwal girl left her home at Rassana in Kathua to graze horses in the nearby forest but didn’t return. A day later, her family registered a case but police couldn’t trace her.  A week later, her disfigured and decomposed body was recovered. It turned out that she had been raped too. The father Mohammad Yusuf said the girl’s “lips had been bitten and there were marks of violence on her thighs and face”. The crime shocked the entire state. Public clamour grew for the police to act and arrest the killer. Bakerwals, a nomadic community, held protests. The issue also rocked the then ongoing Assembly session. The government promised action and formed a Special Investigation Team to probe the case. Two days later, police arrested a 15 year old boy for the murder. Minister for Revenue and Parliamentary Affairs, Abdul Rehman Veeri later informed the House that the accused had confessed to the crime. He said “the accused had kidnapped the minor girl and put her in nearby cowshed at village Rassana, where he attempted to rape her and when she resisted, he killed her by way of strangulation”. The arrest soon assumed a communal colour. The BJP MLA of the area Deepak Sharma visited Rassana later and held deliberations with the people of the one community only. Senior BJP leaders maintained silence over the issue even while the Chief Minister   summoned the family of the girl to her office and assured them of the government’s support. The Bakerwals, however, were not convinced about the involvement of the boy in the rape and murder, arguing that it was not possible for him to restrict the girl to a cowshed for a week. Another breakthrough in the investigation followed on February 10 when police arrested a Special Police Officer (SPO) Deepak Khajuria for the crime. Ironically, Khajuria had been part of the police search team looking for the then missing Asifa. And he had also been a part of the police contingent deployed to break up the crowds protesting the rape and murder. ""Police official held for rape and murder of 8 year old girl in Kathua. It has shaken our soul forever. Kudos to IGP Mr (Alok) Puri for his professional and timely investigation,"" tweeted the Deputy Commissioner Rajouri Dr Shahid Iqbal Choudhary, But since then, the issue has increasingly been communalised. The BJP has jumped to the defence of Khajuria and framed the crime in terms of a battle between nationalists and anti-nationals. Rallies are being taken out in support of the accused, with people participating in them using the tricolour to press their demand for his release. This forced Mehbooba to tweet her disappointment. “Appalled by the marches & protests in defense of the recently apprehended rapist in Kathua. Also horrified by their use of our national flag in these demonstrations, this is nothing short of desecration. The accused has been arrested & the law will follow its course,” Mehbooba wrote. But this hasn’t changed her coalition partner’s behaviour. “We are protesting because an injustice is being done by the government. And this is being done because our area, the area of Kathua, is inhabited by nationalist people. So, the attempt is to subdue us,” the BJP’s Kathua district president P N Dogra told media while leading a protest. “The fault of the accused (Khajuria) is that he was trying to push back against anti-national elements and those shouting pro-Pakistan slogans. It is part of jihad”. The protests demanding the release of Khajuria are being taken out under the banner of Hindu Ekta Manch which is headed by state BJP secretary Vijay Sharma. What is more, even Congress has decided to support the accused. In the protest rally held on Friday at Ghagwal, Congress leaders like Girdhari Lal, a former legislator and Subash Chander, a former MLC were also present were also present beside the BJP leaders Kuldeep Raj, an MLA and Rashpaul Verma, vice-chairman of State Board for Development of Other Backward Classes. This has generated anger in Kashmir Valley and also among large sections of population in Jammu.   “Support for the rape accused is the new high in ultra-nationalism,” wrote Anuradha Bhasin tweeted on the hashtag #Justiceforkathuarapeandmurder. In Valley, the chairperson of the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons Parveena Ahangar termed the rape and murder disgusting. “The rape of Asifa should disgust us all as a people. And at the same time it should wake us up from our slumber; we must ask questions as to why it happened and we should be initiating strong campaigns to build pressure on the state to arrest the perpetrators,” she said in a statement. Far from becoming an issue which should have brought the people together across the political divide, the rape and murder of Asifa has become a fresh source of polarisation in J&K. Even the coalition partners the PDP and the BJP are not on the same page with Congress also supporting the BJP line. “This is a tragedy. This means the rape and murder of a minor girl is no longer an issue. The arrest of the alleged perpetrators is,” says Talib Hussain, an activist who was earlier arrested by the police for protesting the crime. “The BJP is trying hard to communalise the issue and it has succeeded to a large extent. But our effort is to stop the polarization and put the focus back on investigation”. He said he was due to speak on Sunday at a seminar in Jammu city organised by some Hindu organisations in support of the justice for Asifa. “So, there are efforts to salvage the situation. And we hope to succeed in this,” Hussain said.",2018-02-17,,"  Shocking!

During the course of the plenary session, the party will ratify Rahul Gandhi's elevation as president and elect a new working committee and state committee presidents. In the past, whenever a new party president was elected, members of the CWC members and state Congress Committee presidents are replaced or elected. Since most of the state presidents have recently been elected, it is unlikely that it will witness any major changes. However, the CWC will be reconstituted and it is expected that those close to Rahul are expected to make the cut. With 2019 elections in mind, Rahul is likely to bring in some new faces to CWC to ensure a perfect blend of youth and experience. Congress president is looking to infuse new life into the party to take on the BJP which has been on a winning spree ever since it won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014. Meanwhile, sources have informed that the steering committee agreed to have consultations with other Opposition parties over seeking a joint parliamentary committee probe into the Punjab National Bank Scam. The scam has given the Congress much needed ammunition to go on the offensive against the Modi government which has till now claimed to have kept a clean sheet as far as corruption is concerned. In the past, BJP has strategically used JPCs to attack the UPA government over charges of graft. It seems Congress too will work on those same lines to taint the Modi government before the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. Emerging out of the meeting, the Congress president sharpened his attack on the government over the PNB scam and accused the Prime Minister for first forcing people to deposit their money in banks after demonetisation and then letting “his friends and cronies” steal it. “The fact of the matter is that the prime minister through his actions has destroyed the financial systems of this country. He demonetised the economy and took money from people and put it in banking sector and now his friends and cronies are stealing it from the banking sector and the Prime Minister is not saying anything,” he said. He went on to add, “So, I would to request the Prime Minister that he should come out and instead of spending an hour and half explaining to little kids how to take exams, he should explain to the people of India about what will be done about this Nirav Modi and what he is going to do to ensure that the banking sector is safe.”  Questioning the prime minister's silence over the “Rs 22,000 crore” bank scam, Rahul pointed that different ministers, including that of Social Justice and Defence, came but “the Union finance minister and the Prime Minister, who are responsible for this, have not said a word”. He further said that a scam of this nature could not have been possible without “high level protection” and how it should have been known to people in the government. “So, the question is that Narendra Modiji took people's money and put it in banks and in a way took responsibility that you put your money in banks and I will protect it. And now that has turned into a failure and the Prime Minister didn't utter a single word. PM will have to come out and explain what happened and why it happened and what will he do about this,” said the Congress president. When asked about the allegations made by the BJP against Rahul knowing the accused, he said that this was all being done to divert people's attention and that the first complaint was made in 2015. He also pointed that close to 90% of transactions happened under the incumbent government. “This government constantly refuses to accept responsibility and I have said this in my meetings in Karnataka that the Prime Minister looks at the wicketkeeper and then plays cricket.” Meanwhile, a statement released by the Steering Committee went on to claim how the “Bank Scam” has unveiled the “Culture of Crony Capitalism” that has thrived and flourished under the watch of Modi Government. “Over last 45 months, BJP Government has shown ‘zero action’ and ‘zero result’ on bringing back black money stashed abroad as promised by Prime Minister or taking action against accused in multiple corruption scams that have been exposed. ‘Zero Tolerance for Corruption’ has become ‘Zero Tolerance for Accountability on Corruption’,” read the statement. On the issue of main accused Nirav Modi fleeing India before the scam was unearthed, the Congress claimed that the BJP government is allowing “swindlers of public funds” to leave India freely with government agencies acting as silent bystanders. In the statement, party claimed, “The great escape of Lalit Modi, Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and dozens of others accused of banking and other frauds is a case in point. Patent and latent complicity at the highest echelons of power is writ large.”",2018-02-17,," Congress steering committee announces plenary in March, targets Modi on PNB scam | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/congress-steering-committee-announces-plenary-in-march-targets-modi-on-pnb-scam-99691.html
610,Aditya Menon,"The Opposition has consistently done better in Agartala and other urban centres but failed to challenge the Left's dominance over Bengali-speaking farmers.Unemployment is a major issue among the urban youth and BJP is likely to gain because of this. The BJP has focused much of its efforts – rallies and roadshows by top ministers and party leaders -- in the urban centres. The BJP will need to sweep urban Tripura to even have a chance of defeating the Left.Six seats in Agartala city have voted against the Left for half or more Assembly elections since held since 1977. Banamalipur: 7 times out of 8 Bordowali: 6 times out of 8 Agartala: 5 times out of 8 Ramnagar: 5 times out of 8 Badharghat: 4 times out of 8 Barjala: 4 times out of 8 There are two other seats in Agartala – Suryamaninagar and Pratapgarh – where the Left has had a much better record. But BJP insiders are confident about these seats as well. In addition to these, there are two towns, both situated less than 20 km from Agartala, that have often voted against the Left: Mohanpur (7 times) and Bishalgarh (4 times). In many of these seats, BJP will also benefit from the defection of Congress MLAs such as Ratan Lal Nath from Mohanpur and Dilip Sarkar from Badharghat. While these 8 urban seats are all in Tripura West, BJP also has a good chance in two urban seats in Tripura East: Kailashahar and Dharmanagar. Kailashahar, for instance, has elected the Congress 6 times out of 8. However, here the sitting MLA Birajit Sinha has remained loyal to the Congress. Dharmanagar was one of the seats where BJP had a presence even before the defection of Congress leaders and workers to its side. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the part got 20% of the vote share in this Assembly segment, the best performance for it anywhere in the state. The second set of seats which present an opportunity to the BJP are the ST reserved constituencies. Here a lot would depend on how effectively the IPFT manages to take over the entire anti-Left tribal vote of the INPT as well as make inroads into the Left's based among the indigenous communities. There are four ST seats that have often elected non-Left MLAs since 1977: Bagma: 5 times out of 8 Kulai: 5 times out of 8 Charilam: 4 times out of 8  Ampinagar: 4 times out of 8. However unlike some urban seats which have remained consistently anti-Left, in tribal areas the Left’s support has grown with time. For instance in the Bagma seat mentioned above, the Left has won the last three elections while in Charilam, it has won the last four elections. The Left has had interesting history in Tripura’s tribal seats. The CPI(M)’s first electoral toe-hold in Tripura was in the tribal areas, mainly because of the efforts of the Ganamukti Parishad. In Tripura’s first Assembly election in 1967, the Left won 3 seats, all of them reserved for STs. In 1972, the Left won 10 ST seats, which formed a majority of their 17 MLAs in the state. In the 1970s, Left became popular among the Bengal migrant peasantry, which changed the nature of Tripura’s politics. However, this led to a partial alienation of tribals from the Left. Over the next decade, a substantial portion of tribals organised themselves under the TUS, which managed to defeat the Left in alliance with the Congress in 1988. In that election, the alliance won 8 out of 17 tribal seats, the best pefromance in ST seats by the Opposition since 1977. However, divisions among tribal outfits and outreach efforts by the Left changed this and 1993 onwards, the Left re-established its dominance in ST seats. The Left’s popularity in tribal areas is partly because it managed to win over the non-Debbarma landowner tribal communities such as Riyans and provide them political representation. Baju Ban Riyan, a popular tribal leader, was a Lok Sabha MP for 7 terms. It will be an uphill task for the BJP-IPFT alliance in the ST seats as the Left has consistently won more than half of the ST seats in Tripura since 1972. In the last two elections, it won 19 out of 20 ST seats, dominating the tribal areas completely. While these 12 urban seats and four tribal seats mentioned above would be the BJP-IPFT’s best bets, there are 14 other seats which could witness a close fight. These are seats which the Left won with a margin of less than 5% in 2013. The BJP could give Left a run for its money if it manages to consolidate the entire Opposition vote and wean away a section of the Left voters. These seats are Khayerpur, Mandaibazar, Takarjala, Sonamura, Teliamura, Matabari, Kamalpur, Ambassa, Chawamanu, Pabiachara, Pencharthal and Kanchanpur.     As Tripura votes on 18 February, watch out for these 30 seats in the state. BJP-IPFT will need to win most of these seats in order to have a chance of defeating the mighty Left Front.Tripura is witnessing a fascinating contest between two powerful electoral machines - the CPI(M)-led Left Front and the  . The BJP appears to be giving the Left its biggest scare since 1988 when Rajiv Gandhi's Congress managed to win a slender majority along with its ally in the Northeastern state. Assam Deputy Chief Minister and NDA's North East convenor Himanta Biswa Sarma has predicted that BJP-IPFT alliance will do even better than that and win 35-40 seats in the 60-member Assembly.  But how serious are the BJP's chances really? Though the Left Front has been undefeated 1993, the state also has a significant Opposition vote, which till now was held by the Congress and its erstwhile tribal ally, the INPT. The alliance's  has never been less than 40%.  The BJP-IPFT alliance hopes that the entire Opposition vote has shifted to it and this, coupled with the anti-incumbency against the Left, will catapult it to power in the state.    A look at Tripura's electoral history shows that there are 30 seats where the BJP-IPFT could pose a serious challenge to the Left Front. These seats can be divided into two, not mutually exclusive, categories: First, seats which have frequently elected non-Left MLAs since 1977. Second, seats which the Left either lost in 2013 or won by a narrow margin. ",2018-02-18,, Tripura polls: Can BJP win?

611,Anurag Dey,"The  's labour wing, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), is in a fix. While it has been vociferous in criticising the   government’s “anti-labour” policies, it will not be joining central trade unions’ (CTUs) protest on  . The reason it has given is that it “doesn't want to play politics”. The protest by joint platform of 10 CTU’s including Congress’ INTUC and Communist Party of India (Marxist) affiliated CITU, is against the Modi government’s “intensified attack on the lives and livelihood of the people and seriously compromising the national interest”. The CTUs have accused the Centre of dismantling labour laws with an aim to “completely casualise employment conditions through various routes like amending Contract Labour Act, introducing Fixed Term Employment etc”. “The government is out to erase the public sector from the industrial map of the country. Specific cases such as the proposal to privatise of railways, opening coal mining to private and foreign companies without any restriction whatsoever, mass scale privatisation as well as destruction of defence production network through widespread outsourcing, thereby dismantling the almost half of the ordinance factories are some of the examples of the gross anti-people and anti-national actions of the government. “Accumulation of huge non-performing assets of the public sector banks arising out of pilferage of bank-funds by deliberately defaulting private corporate coupled with recent explosion of frauds with bank fund engineered by the same corporate class is also a reflection of the anti-national act of the government indulging and patronising the same big-business class,” the CTUs said in a statement. “The workers and federations of coal and transport have been preparing for united industry-wide actions to be undertaken shortly. All the Federations of Defence Production workers have jointly decided to go in for nationwide strike on  . Many more sectoral actions are in the offing,” it added. The unions also condemned the Union Budget calling it “anti-worker and anti-people in character and engineered a deception on the mass of the people through loud populist slogans without actually making any resource allocation”. While the BMS too has been levelling similar charges against the Modi government and recently held nationwide agitation over ‘anti-labour’ Budget, it has preferred to stay away from the CTU’s   stir. “They have our blessings but we are not joining them. We too want all the trade unions to collectively raise the demands of the workers but then that should not be guided by political considerations. We don’t want to do politics. If they wanted us, they could have asked us to join. But they did not. We are here for the welfare of workers and not to do politics,” said BMS President C K Saji Narayanan. The BMS has been  the Modi government over its economic and labour policies and had dubbed it to be an extension of the Congress-led UPA.   Narayan said the BMS will be staging protests separately. “We have been raising our voices against this government and we will continue to do so. This government has been been insensitive to the demands of the workers and that is reflected in the union budget. “This is perhaps for the first time in India’s history that the Budget speech had no mention of either labour or workers. If this government thinks they can get away by undermining the labour sector's interests, then they are mistaken,” asserted Narayanan. He said the BMS is in talks with MPs across the country for raising labour issues inside parliament. “We are intensifying our labour movement outside parliament through massive mass movement. The fact that the government has postponed the Indian Labour Conference is sign of its wilting under pressure. We will not rest until the workers’ demands are met,” he said. Amid boycott calls by the BMS, the Indian Labour Conference starting on   and to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Scheduled for  -27, the 47th Indian Labour Conference (ILC) was indefinitely postponed by the government amid boycott call by the BMS. It is the highest tripartite forum of trade unions, employers and state and central governments to discuss the issues of workers in the country. Barring the BMS, rest of the trade unions flayed the government for “reducing tripartism to a mockery” by postponing the ILC. The BMS had not joined the CTU’s last year three-day protests in November in the national capital to press for their 12-point charter of demands including minimum wage and social security.   It subsequently held a massive public rally In November last year in Delhi to protest the “failed promises of the Modi government”. The rally was organised over the prevailing economic distress in the country.   CITU general secretary Tapan Sen flayed the BMS for being pro-government.   “Is this is a marriage ceremony that we would be sending out invites? BMS was a part of the joint platform of the CTUs and were a signatory to the 12 point charter of demands. But it preferred to desert it. When the trade unions have been agitating against the anti-labour policies of the government, the BMS prefers to praise it. So why this question now of getting invited,” asked Sen.   The 10 unions participating in the protests are Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS), Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC), Trade Union Coordination Centre (TUCC), Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA), All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), United Trade Union Congress (UTUC) and the Labour Progressive Federation (LPF).    ",2018-02-27,, RSS-backed BMS to stay away from trade union protests against Modi govt | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/rss-backed-bms-to-stay-away-from-trade-union-protests-against-modi-govt-101047.html
612,S Murari,"Tamil film superstars Kamal Haasan and   are a study in contrast: While Kamal is natural in films, refusing to fall into any image trap, Rajini projects a super-hero image on screen. Off-screen Kamal comes across as a confused man with intellectual pretensions. Rajini on the other hand, comes before television cameras in simple pajama and kurta and sporting a stubble and receding hair. As if he is saying “So what if I had started as a bus conductor in Bengaluru? Kamal, on the other hand, is conscious – he is a school dropout from a family of lawyers. This complex shows in his public appearances. It was more apparent when he launched his new political outfit – Makkal Needhi Maiyyam or 'People’s Centre for Justice' from Madurai the other day. He has avoided the Dravidian appellation because critics asked ahead of his launch why he should float a new party if it was going to be another kazhagam, more so when the people are looking for change from 50 years of Dravidian rule in Tamil Nadu.  Yet, having taken the position that the  's (BJP) attempt to gain a foothold in the State after Jayalalitha’s death should be frustrated, Kamal has to show his party is also rooted in Dravidian ethos. Hence the name People’s Justice Party.  He could not have chosen a worse name than that as the Justice Party was a stooge of the British, which was propped up to weaken the Congress-led freedom movement in Tamil Nadu. The Justice Party sustained itself by fighting for representation for non-Brahmins in Government jobs. Periyar, who was part of the freedom movement and was a close associate of C Rajagopalachari, quit the Congress only in 1930 after a state conference where non-Brahmins were discriminated against. Even so, his association with the Justice Party was very brief.  He started his own non-Brahmin movement and that led to reservation for non-Brahmins and the first amendment to the Constitution in 1952. Of course, Ambedkarites say the Dalits were left out of Periyar’s movement. But that’s another story. By taking the name Justice Party to show his politics is rooted in Dravidian politics, Kamal has shown a shallow understanding of history. He has chosen to take the middle path in politics. That is his choice. He has always been close to communists. Unlike in Kerala or West Bengal, the DMK is already leading a secular front with the Congress and the IUML as its allies in Tamil Nadu. Soon the Communist Party of India may join hands with Stalin. Kamal has shown a preference to Chief Ministers who could be leaders of a third front like Pinarayi Vijayan of Kerala, N Chandrababu Naidu of Andhra Pradesh and Mamata Banerjee from West Bengal. Except for Delhi’s  , Naidu and Banerjee are fighting both the Congress and the BJP while Bihar’s   has been a cat on the wall. Ditto Odisha's Naveen Patnaik. Where will Kamal fit in this scheme of things? In any case, he will have to prove his popularity in the home turf before looking at the national level. Can he, therefore, be part of a DMK-Congress front? Despite his proximity to Stalin and M Karunanidhi, it is uncertain. In fact on the eve of his political entry, Stalin described him as well as Rajini as “paper flowers which may shine but will have bloom”.  To Stalin, who is also in his mid-60s, it is going to be a now-or-never battle for power. Such being the case, he does not want any desertions from his party to either Kamal or to Rajini. Hence his attack on Kamal and other star politicians. All that can be par for the course. But what was on show in Madurai was the shocking ignorance of Kamal on issues of vital interest to Tamil Nadu like Cauvery and the plight of Rameswaram fishermen. He went to Rameswaram, but could not find time to interact with the fishermen and instead asked them to share the dais at his press conference. Even so, it was not clear if he was able to grasp their problem. Worse is his shallow talk of resolving the century-old Cauvery dispute with Karnataka through dialogue. The Supreme Court has already given its final order on water sharing and it will be in force for the next 15 years. Does he want to reopen the issue with Karnataka through talks? Worse, he has shown a disinclination to get into details. In sharp contrast, Rajini told reporters later that Tamil Nadu should explore the option of filing a petition for a review before the Supreme Court. Earlier also, he said a long-lasting solution would be interlinking of at least peninsular rivers.  It is a different matter whether it will be feasible or not. At least, Rajini has some grasp of the issue. Rajini has also welcomed all political parties rallying behind the Government on this issue to press the Centre to set up within six weeks the Cauvery Management Board to enforce the tribunal’s final order. Most important, neither Kamal nor Rajini is ready to spend from his pocket. The RK Nagar bypolls showed that contesting elections in Tamil Nadu has become a multi-crore business. Rajini has latched on one of his producers by making him a key member of his fan club. Kamal is talking vaguely of running with public donations. All that can be forgiven, but not Kamal’s failure to plan of action. “Let's go by Chandrababu Naidu’s advice to shed isms and instead do good to the people”, he has said. How will he fight corruption?”With your help”, he says glibly. He has not learnt from Kejriwal’s battle for a Lok Ayukta. In contrast, Rajini has said his will be spiritual politics – or being close to the BJP. Rajini has also said he will tour Tamil Nadu only after his new party is in place at the grass-roots level. Leaders like MGR and Jayalalitha and even Karunanidhi, before he took ill, used to extensively tour Tamil Nadu. Neither Kamal nor Rajini has such indefatigable energy shown by even Modi in the last Lok Sabha elections. Ultimately, you cannot win unless you reach out to the masses. Both know it, but age is against them.  Kamal started his political yatra from Abdul Kamal’s residence.

School authorities must be held accountable for showing such callous disregard to the safety of students, but the more sinister aspects of the case must be highlighted. Arrest warrant has reportedly been issued against Manoj Baitha, the BJP leader who is not just the owner of the vehicle involved but was also reportedly driving it. However, the long arm of the law is yet to catch up with him, amid reports that he may have fled to Nepal. All this happened in the last two days that the ruling BJP took to move on from denying his association with the party to admitting it and suspending his membership for 6 years. In the time that the BJP took to devising its strategy to deal with the crisis, Baitha, reportedly heavily injured in the accident, managed to get himself treated in a private clinic in Muzaffarpur, went home, met his family members, took his belongings, arranged for transportation and fled for Nepal. The sequence of events clearly demonstrates the kind of network that Baitha has. That network could have been responsible for the supply of liquor to him under whose influence he allegedly was while driving on that ill-fated day. BJP and Nitish Kumar must tell the people of Bihar how is that a leader of a party in power had access to liquor in a state where prohibition is in place. Kumar has tried hard to portray that his administration is being strict in enforcing prohibition, with the police regularly cracking down on violators.

614,Anurag Dey,"By executing a living will, a person with deteriorating health or the terminally ill can express his willingness to not remain in a vegetative state with life support system if he/she goes into a state when it will not be possible for them to express their wishes.  It allows a patient to give explicit instructions in advance about the medical treatment to be administered when he or she is terminally ill or no longer able to express informed consent. It also includes authorising a family to switch off life support in case a medical board declared that a patient is beyond medical help.  The document can be presented to a hospital for appropriate action in the event the executant’s health worsens. The government had opposed the concept of Living Will on the grounds that people opting for it may not be aware of future medical advancements. There have been   s of people approaching the court or the government seeking euthanasia for their near and dear ones including a man from Agra seeking death for six of his children diagnosed with a rare disease. The Law Commission of India first in March  and subsequently in August   had recommended a Bill to provide for the protection of patients and medical practitioners from liability in the context of withholding or withdrawing medical treatment including life support systems from patients who are terminally-ill.  Acting on the recommendations only in 2016, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare released the draft Medical Treatment of Terminally-ill Patients (Protection of Patients and Medical Practitioners) Bill on May 9, inviting suggestions. The draft Bill provides protection to patients and medical practitioners (from liability) for withdrawing medical treatment of terminally ill patients. Key provisions of the draft Bill include:  Every competent patient (including minors above the age of 16 years) will have the right to decide and request the medical practitioner to withhold, withdraw, or continue medical treatment in case of a terminal illness. The practitioner will act on the request if he is satisfied that the patient is competent to take an informed decision. In case of minors above 16 years, the consent of the parent and the major spouse will also be required. Before proceeding with the decision, the medical practitioner will be required to inform persons including the spouse, or parent, etc of the need (or otherwise) for withdrawing treatment.  If a patient suffering from terminal illness refuses medical treatment, he will not be liable for an offence under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Without regard to provisions in any other law, in cases where a medical practitioner withdraws treatment on the request of a patient, his action will be lawful.  In case of an incompetent patient (persons of unsound mind, etc), a near relative, medical practitioner etc, can apply to the High Court for granting permission to withdraw or withhold medical treatment.In a historic judgment, the Supreme Court held the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right and gave sanction to passive euthanasia and living will.  Pronouncing the judgment, a Bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra laid down guidelines governing execution and enforcement of living wills and the procedure to be followed for passive euthanasia. “To deprive an individual of dignity at the end of life is to deprive him of meaningful existence,” the Bench said. The landmark verdict by the Constitution Bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justices AK Sikri, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan came in a public interest litigation filed by NGO Common Cause seeking legal recognition for ‘living will’ in India. The petitioner through counsel Prashant Bhushan had sought suitable procedures to ensure that terminally ill patient or those in persistent vegetative state are not deprived of their rights to refuse cruel and unwanted medical treatment like feeding through hydration tubes, or being kept on ventilator and other life support machines in order to artificially prolong their natural life span. The petition sought for a mechanism for allowing patient to execute a document 'My Living Will and Attorney Authorisation' that can be presented to hospitals expressing their wishes as to the medical treatment they would like to receive if they go into persistent vegetative state. A Bench of then Chief Justice P Sathasivam in 2014 had referred the case to the Constitution Bench to resolve inconsistencies between the Division Bench judgment in Aruna Shanbaug case (2011), which allowed passive euthanasia under certain safeguards, and the Constitution Bench judgment in Gian Kaur (1996), which held that the right to life does not include the right to die. In the Aruna Shanbaug case, the Supreme Court allowed passive euthanasia “under exceptional circumstances and under the strict monitoring of the Court”. It also laid down the difference between active and passive euthanasia observing that in active euthanasia something is done to end the patient’s life while in passive euthanasia, something is not done that would have preserved the patient’s life. Delivering separate but concurrent judgments, the court said the life support can be removed only after the statutory medical board declares the patient to be incurable and directed the guidelines and directives so laid down shall be effective till a legislation was enacted for the purpose.",2018-03-09,, SC allows passive euthanasia.

615,Charu Kartikeya,"What has long been evident in the Congress party's conduct has just been confirmed by none other than the authority who lorded over the party for 19 long years. , who stepped down as Congress president just last year, has said in an interview that the recent temple-hopping by her son and successor  , is a response to the BJP's success in convincing Indian voters that the Congress is “a Muslim party”. “I wouldn't say brainwash. Its a rude word. But the BJP has succeeded in convincing the people that Congress is a Muslim party,” Gandhi said, responding to a question on whether her party is practicing “soft-Hindutva”. Notably, she said nothing to deny the “soft-Hindutva” strategy and instead quickly presented her defense, stressing that “Most people in our party are Hindus”. Rahul Gandhi's advisers appear to have prescribed temple visits as political strategy sometime in late 2014. From 2015,  at well-known centres of Hinduism, including Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, Kamakhya temple in Assam and Badrinath and Kedarnath temples in Uttarakhand.  These were not private visits as they were widely publicised by the party itself, leading to ample media coverage. Many believe the strategy partly paid-off when the party managed to inch very close to the ruling BJP's performance in Gujarat Assembly polls, in December 2017. Convinced that the strategy is working, Rahul Gandhi has been visiting temples again in Karnataka, all set to go to polls soon. So far, he and other leaders of his party did not admit that this was a considered strategy, with Gandhi himself retorting every time he was asked about these visits that is he not allowed to visit temples? His mother's statements mark the first time that top leadership of the party has admitted that the party is consciously trying to improve its image among those for whom visiting temples is important. Significantly, Gandhi said Congress leaders including herself used to visit temples earlier too but never made a show of it. That they have decided to openly demonstrate a love for Hindu practices is a landmark moment. It shows that Congress has formally accepted that among the most significant reasons responsible for its defeat in the last Lok Sabha polls is the perception that it had positioned itself too close to India's religious minorities. This was not just the BJP's allegation against Congress, it was also the view privately held by many Congress leaders as well as party-workers. The AK Antony committee's internal report, which was leaked, reportedly said that a perception of minority-appeasement proved to be the party's  .  Sonia Gandhi is not the Congress president anymore but she is still the chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party. Her comments have made it clear that the party indeed took the post-2014 analysis seriously and is still working to reverse that perception. What needs to be considered is will this manifest only in temple visits or will it impact other aspects of the party's electoral strategy too? The Sangh Parivar's vicious political tools of gau-raksha, love-jihad and ghar-wapsi have left the Muslims in a deeply vulnerable position. Further, the BJP winning polls after polls even after refusing to give tickets to Muslims to contest is also leading to their electoral marginalisation. Things have now come to such a pass that RSS is openly revealing its military ambition and RSS-cheerleaders are threatening bloodshed and civil war. It is important in these times for the right-wing to be contested, electorally as well as socially. With the electoral decline of the Left, this onerous task has fallen on the shoulders of the Congress party and regional satraps committed to secular politics. In such times, it is as important for the Congress to recover electoral ground as it is to assure the minorities of solidarity.

616,Sulagna Sengupta,"There was no official announcement of Singhvi's candidature from the Congress when Banerjee declared her support for him at a Trinamool event. It left WB Pradesh Congress Commitee chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury somewhat red-faced. Chowdhury had publicly invited the CPM to put up General Secretary   as candidate, an idea widely popular with the Bengal unit of the Left party. In fact, earlier, the Congress High Command also seemed to be favourable to this idea. But the deep divide within CPM on accepting Congress support led to a dead end. Even then Chowdhury had continued to push for Yechury in a bid. “We feel Sitaram Yechury is the right person to contest for the fifth seat from Bengal. We told Yechuryji Tursday that we will support him if he contests; but he was unwilling,” the Bengal Congress leader said.  Chowdhury went on to say that though the state Congress proposed Yechury's name, the party high command “unanimously” decided on Singhvi. The state unit, according to its chief, was left with no option but to back the lawyer-politician.  Yechury has had a long stint at the Council of States representing Bengal, himself was reportedly not averse to the idea. But his rival faction, led by Prakash Karat, put its foot down. Like Chowdhury-led Bengal Congress, a section of the CPM in the state favour an alliance to take on Trinamool. The two parties, once bitter rivals, have drastically lost political space to Banerjee, reflected by her party's might in the Assembly – 213 of 294 seats. The Congress has 42 members in the House while the CPM – the erstwhile ruling party – was reduced to 26 MLAs after the 2016 elections.  State politics apart, Yechury is also popular cutting across party line for his effective intervention in House debates. The veteran CPM leader has earned kudos for putting the Opposition's point across in a largely saffron Parliament. Yechury has also been known as an ardent backer of Opposition unity against the  , reminiscent of his predecessor Harkishen Singh Surjeet whose support to the United Progressive Alliance was instrumental in ensuring  's first term as Prime Minister. Surjeet was CPM general secretary from 1992 to 2005, when Karat took over. Karat's term until 2015 saw the party withdrawing support to the Centre and reinquishing power in Bengal. In general, there was a move away from alliances with non-Left parties. This trend has drawn wide support from the Kerala unit of CPM, which still counts Congress as its main rival. The Kerala and Bengal factions have been head-to-head on issues several times in the recent past.  In effect, this clash of political lines put paid any hope of Yechury as candidate and the party hurriedly announced the candidature of veteran Kolkata-based politician Robin Deb. “We can't bypass the Central Committee's decision,” Biman Bose, secretary of CPM's West Bengal State Committee. He also highlighted that there was hardly any choice after Congress opted for Singhvi.  Deb is set to file his nomination for the 23 March polls, but is sure to lose to Singhvi. Of the five Rajya Sabha berths up for grab from Bengal, Trinamool has enough seats to muscle through four and then some. For the fifth seat though, no party has enough numbers.  A possible Congress-CPM combine could have kept the seat with the state Opposition. But Banerjee's decision to pool her extra votes for Congress has tilted the balance and opened up new political possibilities. A Trinamool-Congress understanding may emerge as important after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The two parties have earlier cooperated to get dethrone CPM in Bengal (2011) and now have a common enemy in the BJP. While the Congress is eager to wrest back power next year, it knows how difficult the task would be without allies. Banerjee, on the other hand, has seen the saffron party rushing in to fill the vaccum left behind by the CPM.  “Banerjee's main aim is to wipe out the BJP, which is playing communal politics. We will leave no stones unturned,” a senior Trinamool leader said. Chowdhury maintained that it was “too early” to talk about a collaboration. Understandable, considering his priority: to revive state Congress. The high command though may have other priorities. The forthcoming elections to the upper house of Parliament has exposed strange faultlines in West Bengal politics.  As Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced that Trinamool Congress would throw in its extra votes for Abhishek Manu Singhvi of  , it became clear that the Grand Old Party's High Command and state unit were not on the same page. The same can be said about the Communist Party of India (Marxist).",2018-03-10,, Mamata's support for Singhvi opens up new possibilities and faultlines | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/mamata-s-support-for-singhvi-opens-up-new-possibilities-and-faultlines-102432.html

620,Catch Team,"The electronic media broadcast footages of rallies by the BJP and Bajrang Dal where arms were being flaunted. Some grabs showed even children carrying swords. The state  government had already issued prohibitary warnings against carrying arms while state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh had claimed the party woun't pay heed to such warnings. As the day progressed, reports of clashed started pouring in. In Purulia district's Beldi workers of both parties clashed after taking out processions. BJP workers were reportedly armed here too. When the police tried to rein the situation in five personnel were injured. Eventually, in the evening, news agency ANI reported of one death. In North 24 Paragana district's Dum Dum, adjacent to Capital Kolkata, the police stopped a Trinamool rally where some were carrying wooden sticks. In Habra (the same disctrict) Trinamool and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangha activists clashed. There were also reports of violence from Burdwan district too. At several places, BJP leaders were spotted with arms, including in Chinsurah and other places in Hooghly district and in Birbhum and Purulia districts. Party chief Ghosh stuck to his guns and carried a mace first and then a sword. He was also seen wielding sticks on camera. Mukul Roy, the BJP's prize catch from Trinamool, was also seen brandishing a sword. Actor Locket Chatterjee tweeted a photo, holding a trishul. Traditionally, Ram Navami hasn't been celebrated publicly in Bengal. It was the BJP, which made a spectacle out of it   and scored a political point. Desperate to gain electorally in the state, the party has hardly missed a chance to accuse Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of 'minority appeasement' and not protecting the interests of 'majority Hindus'. Going by bye-poll results, its efforts have not gone waste as the saffronites have rised steadily to second spots, displacing the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Congress. In response, the Trinamool has tried to beat the BJP in its own game. Banerjee's and his nephew Abhishek's photographs have increasingly been spotted at celebratory banners for various festivals. Sunday's Ram Navami showdown was perhaps a culmination of that process. Birbhum district's Trinamool strongman Anubrata Mondal claimed the party's processions were to bring harmony. “We do not show case arms. The BJP is trying to create violence by carrying sharp weapons,” he said. Whatever the party might say, the Sangh Parivar called Trinamool's participation in Ram Navami celebration as a victory of its Hindutva agenda. In fact, the right wing and the left wing seemed to agree on this as this tweet by CPI (M) leader Surjya Kanta Mishra. The only difference between Trinamool and BJP rallies seemed to be weapons. Ghosh justified that by calling it an “old tradition” that “Trinamool is not aware of”. Roy too put in his two bits calling the weapons “mere symbols”. But like last year, armed children at rallies pointed to a disturbing trend. At various rallies of Bajrang Dal in Purulia and South Dinajpur districts this was seen. In Purulia, the district administration intervened and a rally was stopped. Social activists have questioned this trend. “This is horrifying and against the Juvenile Justice Act. Children are being used by a political party to carry out their political agenda and people need to raise their voice against it,” Ananya Chatterjee, chairperson of West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said.That Ram Navami celebrations would take a political turn in West Bengal was known, but that politics would be fatal was not. Sunday at least one person died in the state as the ruling Trinamool Congress and the saffron challengers clashed with each other in various places.  Both the parties took out colourful processions – there were decked-up chariots with Ram idols, making leaders offerings and chants of Jai ShriRam.",2018-03-25,," Trinamool, BJP Ram Navami showdown kills one in Bengal | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/trinamool-bjp-ram-navami-showdown-kills-one-in-bengal-104752.html
621,Aditya Menon,"The question now arises, what will happen to the seat tally from Uttar Pradesh if SP-BSP led alliance remains intact? In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP and Apna Dal together secured a vote share of 43.3%, way ahead of the SP, BSP and Congress. But had the SP, BSP, RLD and Peace Party contested together and transferred their votes effectively, they would have been able to match the NDA's vote share. By 2017, there is a nearly 3% decrease in the vote share of the NDA, which is partly made up by the inclusion of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP). On the other hand, the SP and BSP did marginally better than 2014. The SP's 22% vote share is misleading as it contested only 311 out of 403 seats in the state. In the seats it contested, it secured 28% votes. Adding the overall vote shares of the SP, BSP, RLD, Nishad Party and Peace Party, it comes to 46.5%, 5% above the NDA. How does this translate into seats? If one takes the 2014 Lok Sabha result, there are 43 Lok Sabha seats where the combined vote share of the SP, BSP, RLD and Peace Party is more than that of the NDA. This means that had these parties contested in alliance, the NDA would have won just 35 seats instead of the 73 it ended up winning. Interestingly, the NDA would still have won both Gorakhpur and Phulpur despite the alliance. So the bypoll defeats indicate that it isn't just the arithmetic of the SP & BSP coming together, the BJP's popularity has decisively fallen since 2014. Similarly, if SP, BSP, RLD, Nishad Party and Peace Party are able to transfer the votes they secured in the 2017 Assembly elections, they could win as many as 51 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, reducing the NDA to 28, a huge fall of 45 seats from 2014. The vote shares in each Lok Sabha seat have been calculated by adding the votes secured by the various parties in the Assembly segments in that particular seat.   Based on the 2017 Assembly election result, UP's 80 Lok Sabha seats can be divided into 3 categories based on the difference between the combined vote share of the SP-BSP-RLD-Peace Party and the BJP-Apna Dal-SBSP alliance: 1. Seats where the NDA's vote share is higher, 2. Seats where the SP-BSP led alliance's vote share is higher 3. Seats where the Congress' vote share is higher These can further be divided based on the extent of the difference in vote shares. The 2017 Assembly polls are being used as a base and not the 2014 Lok Sabha polls as the Phulpur and Gorakhpur bypolls indicated that the popularity of various parties on the ground is closer to the Assembly polls than the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. NDA lead above 20%: 3 seats Ghaziabad, Bareilly and Varanasi NDA lead 10-20%: 5 seats Gautam Buddh Nagar, Pilibhit, Kanpur, Hamirpur, Fatehpur NDA lead under 10%: 20 seats Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mathura, Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, Kheri, Unnao, Lucknow, Amethi, Pratapgarh, Farrukhabad, Akbarpur, Jalaun, Jhansi, Banda, Bahraich, Mirzapur, Maharajganj, Kushinagar SP-BSP-RLD-NISHAD-PECP lead above 20%: 11 seats Rampur, Mainpuri, Mohanlalganj, Ambedkar Nagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Lalganj, Azamgarh, Ghosi, Jaunpur, Ghazipur, Bhadohi SP-BSP-RLD-NISHAD-PECP lead 10-20%: 20 seats Bijnor, Nagina, Moradabad, Sambhal, Amroha, Baghpat, Badaun, Aonla,Sitapur, Misrikh, Sultanpur, Etawah, Kannauj, Kaushambhi, Barabanki, Shrawasti, Domariyaganj, Salempur, Macchlishahr, Chandauli SP-BSP-RLD-NISHAD-PECP lead under 10%: 20 seats Saharanpur, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Hathras, Firozabad, Etah, Shahjahanpur, Dhaurahra, Hardoi, Phulpur, Allahabad, Faizabad, Kaiserganj, Gonda, Basti, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Bansgaon, Balia, Robertsganj Rae Bareli The list indicates a clear regional variation. The BJP is ahead in big cities like Ghaziabad, Varanasi, Bareilly, Gautam Buddh Nagar and Kanpur as well as seats in Bundelkhand like Hamirpur and Fatehpur. It is faring poorly in Eastern UP, particularly in rural areas. It is leading in only four predominantly rural seats from Eastern UP: Bahraich, Mirzapur, Maharajganj and Kushinagar. Even here the lead is a slender one. On the other hand, the SP-BSP led alliance is better placed in Eastern UP. Eight out of the 11 seats where their vote share lead over NDA is above 20% are in Eastern UP. The alliance also has a significant lead in Muslim dominated-seats in Rohilkhand like Rampur, Bijnor, Nagina, Moradabad, Sambhal and Amroha. It is also did well in Yadav family bastions like Mainpuri, Badaun and Kannauj and the Jat and Muslim-dominated RLD bastion Baghpat. More than Friday's Rajya Sabha poll, the upcoming bypoll to the Kairana Lok Sabha seat would be critical in showing which way the wind is blowing. In 2014, BJP's vote share was 3% more than the combined vote share of SP, BSP, RLD and PECP. By 2017, the combined vote share of these 4 parties as 2% more than the BJP in the 5 Assembly segments of Kairana. The BJP has played the communal card to the hilt here and it remains to be seen if the SP-BSP-RLD's caste calculus is able to counter it.On Friday, the   succeeded in winning an additional Rajya Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh after its candidate Anil Aggarwal defeated Bahujan Samaj Party ( ) nominee BR Ambedkar based on second preference votes. But the saffron party appears to have failed in its larger objective – of nipping a BSP-  alliance in the bud. On Saturday, BSP supremo   addressed a press conference and said that the BSP's alliance with the SP was very much intact.  ""The BJP tried every trick to break our alliance. But they did will not succeed. They have won only through malpratices,"" she said, thanking the SP and the Congress for supporting the BSP's BR Ambedkar. She further accused BJP of being brazenly anti-Dalit. The BSP chief has warmed up to the SP to such an extent that she made it a point to talk about the one incident that stood at the heart of her rivalry with the SP. ""BJP reminds us of guest house incident of June 1995.The incident took place with the motive to murder me. Akhilesh is not responsible for it. What is BJP trying to prove by elevating the cop involved in that incident to the top post? Does the BJP  government want to get me killed?"" she said. With Mayawati almost providing her stamp of approval for the alliance with SP, something which she hadn't openly done even during the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls, it is bad news for the BJP.  In its desire to win an extra Rajya Sabha seat, the BJP has pushed BSP further towards an alliance with the SP, a development that could cost the saffron party heavily in the Lok Sabha elections. The alliance has the potential of denying Prime Minister   a second stint in power. There are two aspects to why the alliance poses a major threat to PM Modi. First, the combined vote share of the SP and BSP, is more than that of the BJP and its allies in a majority of seats in Uttar Pradesh. Second, there has been a clear swing away from the BJP and in favour of the SP and BSP from the Lok Sabha polls in 2014 to the Assembly elections last year. The effectiveness of the alliance could be seen in the recent by-elections in Gorakhpur and Phulpur. The SP, with the support of the BSP,   (RLD), Nishad Party and Peace Party (PECP), managed to defeat the BJP in the seats vacated by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister   and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya. The SP and BSP, RLD and Peace Party fought separately in 2014 and 2017. In 2014, even the combined vote share of these parties was less than the BJP in both these seats. However, this situation had changed by 2017 as the vote share of the BJP and its ally Apna Dal had fallen by 11.7% in the 5 Assembly segment in Gorakhpur and by 9.4% in the 5 segments in Phulpur. Conversely, the combined vote share of the SP, BSP, RLD, Peace Party and the newly formed Nishad Party had increased by 3.6% in Gorakhpur and by 9.1% in Phulpur. This trend further intensified in the bypoll, especially in Phulpur. BJP-Apna Dal's vote share further fell by 4.2% while that of the SP-BSP led alliance increased marginally by 0.5% compared to 2017. The situation in Gorakhpur was slightly different as the BJP's vote share actually increased from the Assembly election. This could be because the Hindu Yuva Vahini, which had put up rebel candidates during the Assembly polls was no longer in the fray, besides of course the fact that five-time Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath was now the CM of UP. However, a significant 6.5% increase in the SP-BSP led alliance neutralised this, paving the way for the victory of SP candidate Praveen Kumar Nishad, son of Nishad Party founder Sanjay Nishad.",2018-03-24,, RS loss fails to break SP-BSP alliance.

622,Riyaz Wani,"Even by Kashmiri standards where more and more youth taking up the gun now hardly attracts any notice, this is unthinkable: for the first time a top separatist leader’s son has joined militancy. Junaid Ashraf Khan, son of Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai, the newly appointed chief of separatist oufit Tehreek-i-Hurriyat, went missing on Friday after he left his home at Srinagar’s Baghat area for Friday prayers.  The Family lodged a missing report at the nearby police station. But as has by now become a familiar turn of events, a picture of Khan brandishing a Kalashankov went viral across social media. The picture had his address and his father’s name emblazoned across it. Khan has joined Hizbul Mujahideen, the pro-Pakistan militant outfit.  When contacted, a family member refused to talk, saying they were “too much in shock to say anything about the development”.  “Think about our state of mind,” he said.  Soon after his taking over as the TeH chief, Sehrai had expressed himself against the advent of Islamic State and al-Qaeda in Kashmir, saying the Kashmir cause had nothing to do with any organisation espousing a global agenda. “Our agenda is simple. We only want Kashmir to be free from Indian occupation. Nothing else,” Sehrai had said in an interview to a local daily. “Daesh and Al-Qaida have nothing to do with our movement and we will never accept them”. Sehrai had also urged Zakir Musa, chief of Ansar Gazwat-ul-Hind, an al-Qaeda affiliate, to shun his extremist ideology. “Zakir Musa is the light of my eyes. He left everything for a sacred cause. But I want to tell him that by moving towards extremism he was doing India a favour,” Sehrai said.  Two days later, his son, an MBA, took up arms and it stunned Kashmir. Security agencies too. Jammu and Kashmir Police Director-General SP Vaid termed the development “unfortunate”. He was quick to urge Sehrai to persuade his son to return and set an example for others to follow. “I urge Sehrai that since he is in command, he should appeal his son and other local boys wielding guns to return. He should himself take a lead in entering into a dialogue so that youth of Kashmir are saved from the path of violence,” Vaid said. The development has also set social media talking. The drift of the conversation has largely favoured Khan’s decision, with a minority view expressing concern at the troubling new direction that Kashmir was taking. “Now no 1 can say huriyat leaders settle their family outside n play with future of others (sic),” posted one user on Facebook while sharing Khan’s picture.  “(Khan’s joining militancy) sets a new bar for #Kashmir separatist leadership. May catapult #Sehrai to a level where his leadership remains undisputed. A possible flip to militancy also (sic),” tweeted another. ”Now what will india counter this with. Situation is literally out of control in kashmir or can we say India has lost kashmir. Axed it's own toes by using policy of iron fist in Kashmir (sic),” tweeted yet another. The unusual development has cast a renewed spotlight on the trend of the local youth joining militancy. A phenomenon that seemed to have been largely confined to the interiors of the countryside in South Kashmir is now radiating out to the urban centres including Srinagar. The trend is also creeping up the social ladder with the youth which are highly educated and belong to affluent and apparently insulated families also taking the plunge. Sehrai’s is one such family.  A few months ago, Mannan Wani, a PhD student from Aligarh Muslim University, joined Hizbul Mujahideen. Incidentally, Wani hails from Tikipora, Kupwara, Sehrai’s ancestral village. Sehrai, seen as successor to separatist patriarch Syed Ali Shah Geelani, is unlikely to go against his son’s decision, as doing so will run counter to his long-held political beliefs and that of the ideological stance of Hurriyat G, a powerful hardline secessionist alliance of which TeH is a constituent. Though a professed votary for a peaceful political movement for Kashmir’s merger with Pakistan, Hurriyat G has traditionally rationalised the militant struggle as a course of action forced upon the youth by “India’s intransigence”. In his statements, Sehrai has defended the political and militant struggle as essential to the achievement of goal of Azadi.  At the same time, having a son as a militant will substantially boost Sehrai’s moral stature as a separatist leader in Valley. It has, for once, dented the argument that the separatist leaders preached jihad to neighbours’ kids and saved their own.  “Ashraf Sehrai’s son joins Militant ranks, breaking the norm that separatists enjoy ravishly while others die,” tweeted Jibran Asim. Earlier, it were only the militant leaders from Pakistan who are known to send their children to fight in Kashmir. Among them is the Mumbai attack mastermind Zakiur-Rehman Lakhvi and Abdur Rehman Makki, second-in-command in Jamat-u-Dawa headed by Hafiz Saeed. While Lakhvi’s 20-year-old son Mohammad Qasim was killed way back in 2007 in an encounter in Bandipore area, Makki’s two sons – Abu Musaib and Abu Owaid – were killed in 2017.",2018-03-25,, Hurriyat chief's son picks up gun.

624,Sulagna Sengupta,"The West Bengal Panchayat polls are proving to be a bloody affair with there being reports of clashes on Wednesday between workers of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) and Opposition parties, particularly the  . The BJP has decided to move the Supreme Court on Thursday, urging that central forces be deployed during filing of nominations. “We have moved the Supreme Court and urged for deployment of Central forces during filing of nominations as our party workers could not file nominations peacefully,” said BJP leader Mukul Roy, who was earlier a key lieutenant of AITC supremo Mamata Banerjee. The AITC on its part is accusing the BJP of instigating the violence. On Wednesday, fresh violence occurred at Raigunj where some pistol-wielding goons fired blank shots.  A clash broke out between BJP and Trinamool workers during the filing of nominations. Amol Acharya, a Trinamool district in-charge, said “We have already informed the police that the BJP has hired goons who are trying to create an atmosphere of terror in the area and we have urged the state election commission to conduct an inquiry on the violence in Raigunj.” State Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee said, “State BJP president Dilip Ghosh is creating an environment of terror by saying that least 70-80 people will be sent to cremation ground in this Panchyat election”. According to Chatterjee, an AITC delegation will meet State Election Commissioner Amarendra Kumar Singh on Thursday and urge him take action against Ghosh for his threat. A BJP delegation, too, met Singh to urge him to deploy central forces for the elections. On Wednesday, the State Election Commissioner met Governor KN Tripathi who is said to have instructed him to provide a detailed report of the security provisions that will be there during the Panchayat elections. Sources in the Raj Bhavan said that the duo also spoke about the need for deployment of Central forces after violence continued unabated state during the filing of nominations. To counter the BJP's charge that the party is not being allowed to file nominations, Partha Chatterjee provided data stating, “AITC has filed 1,614 nominations, BJP 1,143, CPI(M) 351, Congress 127 and Independents 200. A total of 1821 Opposition candidates filed nominations, but still Opposition parties are saying that they were not allowed to file nominations”. The AITC is also accusing the BJP of using the Governor's office to create confusion in the state. Besides Ranigunj, violence also took place on Wednesday at Nayagram in Jhargram, Purulia and Mayureshwar in Birbhum. In Murshidabad, AITC and Congress workers clashed after the ruling party's workers allegedly prevented the latter's candidate from filing his nomination. At Khanakul in Hooghly, a clash took place between two AITC groups when one group went to file their nomination. On Tuesday, clashes are said to have taken place in Malda, Bankura, Murshidabad, Hooghly and Birbhum districts. On Monday, too there were stray instances of violence in Midnapore, Behrampore and Burdwan. CPI(M) leaders alleged that their candidates were not allowed to file their nomination papers at Sutahata, Panskura, Khejuri-1 and Khejuri –II of East Midnapore as the ruling AITC dragged them out of the election offices and beat them up. The BJP has accused AITC of thrashing it's cadres at the Sutahata block office. Sporadic violence also occoured at various block development offices at Burdwan East and Bankura. In Malda’s Kaliachak, one AITC worker, Nizamur Rahman was killed by his own party workers as a result of the internal feud . According to political analyst Amol Mukherjee, “What is different this time is that this time it isn't just the ruling party, but also the BJP that responsible for violence”. Analysts also point out that usually violence takes place close to polling day, but this time it has started from the filing of nominations itself.",2018-04-04,, Why the West Bengal Panchayat elections are proving to be one of the bloodiest ever | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-the-west-bengal-panchayat-elections-are-proving-to-be-one-of-the-bloodiest-ever-106332.html
625,Rajeev Khanna,"  After an eventful stint in the human resource ministry, Smriti Irani is creating fireworks in her new avatar as information and broadcasting minister as she is seen going after journalists in an effort that is being viewed as coercing them into submission. This leads to an obvious question that where is she getting these bright ideas from? The answer perhaps lies in the model of the state that she represents in the Rajya Sabha – the much touted Gujarat Model that was developed by the Prime Minister   in his role as the chief minister of the state that he ruled with a heavy hand for almost 13 years. “What Delhi journalists are experiencing now, Gujarat has experienced years before,” was the response of a senior vernacular journalist based in Ahmedabad. Irani had first triggered the row over 'punishing' journalists for 'fake news' that eventually ended in a fiasco with Modi ordering a roll back. While certain Delhi editors naively praised Modi for the move, Gujarati journalists know better. Most journalists in Gujarat say that it is highly unlikely that Modi did not know about the move given the highly centralised pattern of functioning of his government. It is being felt that he tried to go in for some damage control by ordering a roll back and trying to propagate his image as a liberal. In fact they say that the notification issued by Irani's ministry had Gujarat Model written all over it. In Gujarat accreditation has remained an issue with journalists of repute for quite sometime. “The government has always been reluctant to extend the facility to those who have been questioning its policies at every step,” pointed one of the most senior journalist who retired from a leading English daily a couple of years back and has recently not been given accreditation in the veteran journalists' category despite his writing for a news portal continuously. “The accreditation committee formed by the government is known to have friendly journalists who do not think twice before rejecting an application from a genuine applicant,” disclosed another journalist who was denied the facility without specifying any reason about a decade back while he was working with a leading English daily. The facility was extended to him only after his editor took a stand. “It was during the  's (BJP) regime that my accreditation was canceled in 1996 for filing a story against a cabinet minister having an extra marital affair with one of the female officers of his department. The story was broken from Kutch with photographs. Even now there are many examples where not only individual journalists but even papers have been denied the accreditation benefits,” says another senior journalist Dilip Patel. And who can forget the 'sedition and treason' case filed by a senior police officer against the senior reporter and resident editor of a prestigious paper like  in Ahmedabad in 2008. This had sparked a series of protests before he matter died down. After the 'accreditation cancellation' threat fiasco there are reports of the Press Information Bureau (PIB), the information apparatus under Irani's ministry, working on a proposal to keep a tab on the movement of journalists at government buildings and offices through radio-frequency identification (RFID) cards. There are reports that the PIB wrote to the Union home ministry in January asking if the accreditation cards it issues to journalists could be replaced with RFID cards. This too is nothing new. It was in the first half of last decade that the reporters going to Gujarat secretariat regularly were issued an ancient version of such cards along with the state accreditation cards. These white cards, issued after strenuous police verification, were to be punched at the entry of the 14 secretariat blocks and the barricade would open to let one in. Of course the journalists after entering from one block could move to some of the other blocks (not all) but the apprehension was that it could be known in which part he or she had moved around during the day. The aim was supposedly to curtail the passing of information from government officials to journalists. This was not the only step during the Modi regime to curtail dissemination of information. Before his arrival on the scene, the Gujarat Information Department used to deploy a bus from Ahmedabad to the secretariat four days a week from Monday to Thursday. This bus would transport the journalists who covered the secretariat on daily basis so that they could save time and do their job. This bus service was brought down to once a week under the Modi regime except for the days when the Assembly is in session. “The culture of the chief minister interacting with the media at least once a week that had prevailed till the Keshubhai Patel was also done away with during the Modi regime. Instead a couple of government spokespersons were appointed from among the ministers who briefed the media once a week on matters pertaining to various ministries and departments,” pointed a veteran journalist. Quoting an interesting anecdote he said, “ After one such briefing I once called up the minister in whose name a press note had been issued asking for more details on a matter. The minister told me that he did was not aware that a press note on the said subject had been issued in his name and was caught unawares.” Now does that ring a bell? Recall a recent report appearing in a section of the media where Rajesh Jain in whose name a book named 'Mann Ki Baat: A Social Revolution on Radio' was released last year at Rashtrapati Bhawan, has reportedly come out saying he had nothing to do with the book. The book is stated to be an analysis of Modi's radio show 'Mann ki Baat.' ""Rajesh Jain had absolutely nothing to do with this book (on Mann ki Baat),"" former union minister Arun Shourie reportedly told NDTV a few days ago (https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/who-wrote-book-on-pms-mann-ki-baat-arun-shourie-claim-throws-up-mystery-1832548). ""He (Jain) is my friend. He told me he had been dragged into the (book release) function, given a speech to read,"" said Shourie. Jain too reportedly corroborated the former minister's claim. ""I was not the author of 'Mann ki Baat' book and was surprised to see my name as author,"" he reportedly told the channel. A release on the book release along with another book had been reportedly sent by the PIB. He culture of sending across pre recorded video bites instead of a press conference on various issues to television channels for telecast had also started during the Modi regime. Another feature of select briefings was also there which eventually has become the norm in several other states also including those ruled by the Congress like Punjab. There was another hallmark of Modi's media interactions – the interaction would stop at the first uncomfortable question which in those days was obviously related to the Godhra incident and subsequent pogrom, as well as the alleged fake encounters. Modi would just ask those present to proceed for lunch or tea. He has not had a press conference as the prime minister till now. It remains to be seen how he would take uncomfortable questions if ever he holds one before the next Lok Sabha polls. Till then Irani continues to toy with new ideas on how to rope in journalists.  ",2018-04-05,, Why Smriti Irani's fake news notification had Narendra Modi written all over it | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/why-smriti-irani-s-fake-news-notification-had-narendra-modi-written-all-over-it-106489.html
626,Neeraj Thakur,"Among the incumbent cabinet ministers there are a few candidates who are trusted by PM Modi for top jobs in his government. Among those Railways minister   is formidable candidate for taking over the reign of the ministry of finance in case the Jaitley’s recovery takes longer. He is an accountant and was the brain behind the UDAY scheme that sought to de-stress India’s debt laden power distribution companies. Another name who could be chosen for the top job from among the incumbent cabinet ministers is  . He is currently looking after the ministries of commerce & industries and civil aviation. The government is looking to sell Air India ltd this year and Prabhu would be in a better position to manage the deal as a finance minister. There is another name that pops up from the among cabinet ministers for managing the finance department of the government. The man is  , who served as the president of BJP in the past. With strong backing in the RSS Gadkari can get his name recommended by the top dignitaries from the organization that provides the control the ideological framework and ground cadre for the BJP. He currently looks after the ministry of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources. Whoever steps into Jaitley's shoes, has a tough task at hand.Finance minister  ’s renal failure is likely to keep him out action for some time. According to media reports he is likely to travel aboard for kidney- transplant surgery. Some reports have also suggested that the his surgery will be undertaken by doctors at the All India Institute of Medical sciences. While Jaitley has been keeping unwell for sometime, the need for surgery is likely to make it difficult for him to undertake the pressure that finance ministry puts on the minister in charge, especially in the last year before the Loksabha elections. In the past, Jaitley has undergone bypass surgery for diabetes management. Jaitley oversaw a very tumultuous tenure of Indian economy- during demonetization and Goods and Services Tax implementation- when growth fell by more than 2 percentage points in the first quarter of 2017-18. India’s banking sector is also tottering with new an ever increasing rate of non-performing assets and busting of newer scams. To keep the functioning of the economy smooth, it would be important for Prime Minister   to ensure that there is no policy paralysis at the finance ministry in the duration when Jaitley is away from work. Another BJP cabinet minister-  - underwent a similar surgery last year, but the government could afford to have her on leave since it was PM Modi himself who is running the show of the foreign affairs minister since forming the government. In the case of Jaitley, if he stays off the ministerial work for long, it could become difficult for the government to manage things like divestment, roll out of the mega health care scheme announced in 2018-19 budget by Jaitley himself and management of the agriculture sector which is under distress due to crash in prices of various commodities. The government will also have to firefight the opposition on the question of job creation in the country. This will require a fully fit finance minister on Modi’s side who could take the stress of working 24X7 in the run up to the elections.  ",2018-04-05,," With Jaitley unwell, Modi needs an FM who can tackle crucial political challenges | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/with-jaitley-unwell-modi-needs-an-fm-who-can-tackle-crucial-political-challenges-106502.html
627,Anurag Dey,"Tuesday the saffron party hit back at rival Congress over the candidature of HS Chandramouli, lawyer for absconding diamond merchant Mehul Choksi. Parliamentarian and party spokesperson GVL Narsimha Rao alleged the accused in the multi-crore Punjab National Bank fraud case, enjoyed the “patronage” of Congress President  . “Congress’ connections with Mehul Choksi keep on emerging one after the other. One incident can be a coincidence, but multiple coincidences means it is a conspiracy. There is no doubt Choksi enjoyed patronage and support of Rahul Gandhi. “And that is why Congress had rewarded Chandramouli, who as a lawyer defended Mehul Choksi in case involving cheating in 2015,” said Rao. He alleged that the police complaint involving the cheating incident was subsequently converted in a civil complaint at Congress’ insistence. Rao said Chandramouli was also legal consultant of Congress leader KJ George, a prime accused in the case of suicide of deputy superintendent of police MK Ganapathi in 2016. “Since Chandramouli has been making efforts to save one offender after another, he has been rewarded with candidature, which makes us believe that Congress ka haath Mehul Choksi ke saath”, he said.  Citing Rahul Gandhi’s presence at a promotional event of Choksi-owned Gitanjali Jewels in 2013, Rao said: “It not just Rahul Gandhi alone, there is a long list of Congress’ connections with Choksi. In 2013, (former Finance Minister) P Chidambaram removed the director of Allahabad Bank for denying to restructure a loan of Rs 1,550 crore to Choksi when he highlighted the lacunae in it. “Then the premises of Abhishek Manu Singhvi in Mumbai was rented to Choksi and even his wife bought jewellery worth Rs 5 crore from unaccounted cash,” he alleged. Earlier BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya had questioned the Congress’s move to field Chandramouli instead of Brijesh Kalappa who is Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah’s legal advisor. Kalappa expressed his anguish and disappointment in a Facebook post: “I have been denied LS 2009, 2014. R S in 2014, 16, 18 and now Assembly. “I will swallow the ignominy of being ousted from the race by a Person who joined the Party in 2016, got a Legislative Council Ticket the same year, lost and the same person now bags the Assembly ticket for Madikeri. This begs the question- if one person were given so many opportunities by the Congress Party, why did we let a brilliant person like Jayaprakash Hegde go merely because he wanted the MLC ticket after he lost Lok Sabha elections?! I will try for Gram Panchayat next time,” Kalappa had said in the post. There also have been reports unhappy with the developments, the Congress had put on hold Chandramouli’s candidature. The Congress subsequently dismissed the reports and in turn questioned the BJP’s links with Choksi and former cricket administrator Lalit Modi. “If being an advocate is a charge, then the BJP is liable to answer for Union minister   whose daughter’s legal firm was hired by Choksi.  “They should also answer for External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje for procuring travel documents to Lalit Modi. The BJP should focus on issues faced by the country rather than indulging in diversionary ploys,” said Congress leader Jaiveer Shergil.After revealing their candidates for the upcoming elections to the Karnataka elections, the   and the   have turned their focus to picking faults at each others' candidates.

Janardhana was indicted in the Bellary illegal mining scam and the related Belekeri port scam. The BJP has also fielded B Sriramulu, a close confidant of Janardhana. It has so far announced candidates for 154 of the 224 seats for which polls will be held May 12.

628,Sulagna Sengupta,"Barely a day after Swami Aseemanand's acquittal in the Mecca Masjid blast case, the West Bengal BJP is said to have begun efforts to reach out to him. Sources in the West Bengal BJP said that state unit president Dilip Ghosh spoke with Aseemanand's brother Sushanta Sarkar, who is the district secretary of the BJP in Hooghly, to take the Hindutva preacher's number. A senior BJP leader said “West Bengal BJP unit is considering utiising Swami Aseemanand's skills of organising Advasis to increase the BJP’s strength in Bengal. He has already set up different Adivasi student hostels in Purulia, Bankura, Coochbehar, Alipurduar and Siliguri”. On 16 April, the special NIA court acquitted all the five accused including Aseemanand in the Mecca Masjid blast case. The blast took place on 18 May, 2007 which claimed nine lives. As many as 58 people were injured in the blast. Sushanta Sarkar further said “ On Wednesday, Dilip Ghosh called me up and took the phone number of my brother. I am unaware whether the state BJP is thinking of inducting them in the party or not. I have not been informed about any such development. I gave Swami Aseemanand’s phone number to Ghosh.” Sources in state BJP said that Aseemanand has set up 25 Adivasi students hostel in Purulia and around 10 Adivasi student hostels at Jhilmil in Bankura. In Coochbehar and Alipurduar too he has set up many hostels. Before his arrest, he was largely based in Gujarat as the government there was favourable to his activities. According to West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh, “It’s true that I contacted Sushanta Sarkar and took Swami Aseemanand’s phone number. I will contact him and there are plans to take him to various villages ahead of the panchayat elections"".  According to Ghosh, Aseemanand has worked with the Adivasis and so he will have a natural rapport with them.  Aseemanand's real name is Nabakumar Sarkar and he hails from West Bengal. In the mid 90s, he launched a campaign against Christians in South Gujarat's Dangs district, with the help of the RSS. Many of these Christians were poor and Aseemanand is said to have converted them to Hinduism. Subsequently, his network and activities also grew and he set up many schools for Adivasis in the state. In 1998, Gujarat also witnessed violence against tribal Christians, which many blame on the activies of Hindutva outfits like Aseemanand's Vanvasi Kalyan Parishad.",2018-04-18,, Is BJP trying to rope in Swami Aseemanand for West Bengal? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/is-bjp-trying-to-rope-in-swami-aseemanand-for-west-bengal-108647.html
629,Charu Kartikeya,"The embarrassment for BJP is heavier in light of the fact that Vala has become the second NDA Governor to have his actions overturned by the courts. In July 2016, the SC restored the Congress-led government in Arunachal Pradesh, after terming as “illegal” and “violative of constitutional provisions” Governor JP Rajkhowa’s advancement of the session of the state Assembly. The advancement had triggered an intense round of political crisis in the state leading to the imposition of President’s Rule on January 26. Uttarakhand's case must also be recalled, wherein the Uttarakhand High Court quashed the Centre's decision to impose President's Rule in the state, April 2016. Challenging the arbitrariness that was evident in the imposition of President's Rule, the SC had noted that “there is no king or absolutism. Howsoever high you are, the law is above you.” BJP as well as all other political parties must heed to these three judgments. They must always remember that no one should get so arrogant to assume that in the name of Constitutional powers they will do anything and get away with it. In Karnataka, for now, its over to the House.In a display of the majesty of the Indian Constitution's scheme of checks and balances, the Supreme Court Friday made a massive intervention in the process of government formation in Karnataka. After the midnight courtroom drama two days ago, all eyes were on the top court today, as it resumed the hearing on the Congress party's petition challenging Governor Vajubhai Vala's invitation to  's BJP's BS Yeddyurappa to form the government. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court came to the conclusion that “floor test to ascertain the majority of one or the other group is conducted immediately and without any delay”. The top court's order bringing down the time given by Governor Vala to Yeddyurappa to prove majority in the Assembly from 15 days to just one was a momentous ruling. It will be remembered and cited as a landmark precedent from now on. It had been widely argued that the Governor's conduct in matters of government formation was beyond judicial scrutiny, but the apex court has proved that to be a fallacy. The verdict will stand as a lesson for future governments elsewhere too since abuse of the discretionary power given to a Governor by the Constitution was a rampant practice so far. For Karnataka, this verdict will mean that the BJP camp will get only about one day now to get non-BJP MLAs to defect. The BJP has 104 MLAs, 8 short of the magic number required to prove majority in the Assembly. Congress-JD(S) combine has 117 MLAs. Fearing poaching of MLAs from their camp, Congress and JD(S) had packed off their MLAs to a resort in Hyderabad. They were gearing up for a 15-day stay, but are on their way back to Bengaluru now. Though the SC order does not reprimand the Governor for giving Yeddyurappa 15 days, the order itself is an embarrassment for Vala. In his letter to him seeking the crucial invitation, Yeddyurappa made no effort to convince the Governor that he had the numbers and yet the Governor invited him.",2018-05-18,, Vajubhai becomes second NDA governor to be rapped by courts | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/vajubhai-becomes-second-nda-governor-to-be-rapped-by-courts-113670.html
630,Joyjeet Das,"Bookanakere Siddalingappa Yeddyurappa rose on the floor of Bengaluru's majestic Vidhana Saudha Saturday afternoon after all newly elected members were sworn in. But instead of seeking the support of the majority of those members, the chief minister of Karnataka launched a melodramatic speech. By the time it was 4 pm -- when the House to vote -- he had given up on the fight, the first such instance in a long time from the safforn camp. The   tried to hardsell Yeddyurappa's move as an elegant one. But the fact is that it just lost a crucial battle after announcing to everyone who cared to hear that the party would win it handsomely. Controversial Governor Vajubhai Vala now doesn't seem to have much option than to invite   (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy to govern the state. The way his party as well as the   have been able to guard their MLAs, Kumaraswamy seems to be in comfortable position to sail through a trust vote. He has put a very condifent image forward ever since Vala invited Yeddyurappa, and not him, to form government. The former CM and son of former prime minister HD Deve Gowda consistently maientained that all non-BJP MLAs were united and there were no cases of defection. In fact he went a step further and threatened to poach two of the BJP's MLAs if it tried to take one from his party. Legislators of both parties had a tough time in the last two days, after Vala Thursday backed his old party BJP, shifting from a resort to Hyderabad and back. Two Congress MLAs reportedly remained untraceable until Saturday and there were several allegations that the BJP was trying to buy its way into governing a state in South India, where it governs none. That alone has made Karnataka an important fight for BJP President  , who has delivered state after state to the saffron party's kitty. Not only did he fail in his Mission 150, but the tally of 104 seats was way lower than the ""at least 130"" he had vowed to get even on the last day of campaigning. This despite Prime Minister  's extensive  campaign in all regions of Karnataka. A friendly governor still ensured them pole position but a spirited fight by the Congress-JD(S) camp -- getting the Supreme Court to open its gates past midnight -- negated  everything.  After the results, in fact, the fight gradually spread out from Karnataka to attract other regional parties as well.  's Bahujan Samaj Party is anyway a partner in the coalition, supported also by  . West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee vocally advocated a Congress-JD(S) tie-up. Her Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan's tourism department offered to house the MLAs of the combine. When Kumaraswamy reached out to Andhra CM Chandrababu Naidu, he reportedly offered three places for the MLAs to camp. Eventually the choice was Hyderabad where K Chandrasekhara Rao's police kept them protected. In Bihar,   raised the demand that if Yeddyurappa could be CM for leading the single-largest party, his Rashtriya Janata Dal should be allowed to do the same. Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary   and Jammu and Kashmir National Conference leader Omar Abdullah castigated the BJP for its strong-arm tactics. Basically, not only the BJP failed to manage the numbers, it also brought the Opposition together. Also, none of its ally came out in support. With General Elections a year away, that doesn't augur well at all for the BJP. This doesn't mean that work is over for the Congress and JD(S). It, in fact, has just begun. They are yet to form the government. If and when it does, all eyes will be on them.

631,Rajeev Khanna,"The issue pertaining to Hindutva groups stopping Muslims from offering Namaz in the open areas in Gurugram and the state chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar saying that prayers should be offered in mosques and Eidgahs once again shows how the Hindu right wing has been successful in taking forward its agenda of majority hegemony. What is most disturbing is not what the Hindutva groups conveyed by stopping the prayers in open spaces over the last two weeks when the first instance was reported from Sector 53 but the absence of a strong response on the ground from the key “secular” political players in the state. Both the Congress and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) did nothing on the ground to counter the terrorising of minorities by Hindutva elements except for some feeble statements, that too when one or two odd reporters raised the questions before them. What Khattar said about offering prayers in mosques and his Cabinet minister Anil Vij reportedly repeating his stand is simply an icing on the Hindutva cake of terrorising the minorities as one of the prime motives of their political agenda. By maintaining a silence all this while and doing nothing on the ground to infuse some confidence among the minority community, the Congress and the INLD have allowed Khattar to set the agenda on this issue. The Muslim population in the state is disillusioned with both these parties for playing the soft Hindutva card on not only this issue but on issues like cow vigilantism and people being targeted for allegedly selling and consuming beef. They point out that these parties have neither shown any foresight or developed a political strategy to counter the agenda of the   (BJP) and other Hindutva groups on these issues. “There is nothing called ideology left in any of the parties. They just want to get the majority Hindu votes by not even daring to talk about the minorities,” said a Muslim politician from the state. In fact things are fast moving towards the scenario that has been witnessed in Gujarat, a state that is often referred to as the laboratory of the Sangh Parivar. For several months there have been apprehensions aired by minorities, Dalits and progressive groups that Haryana is going the Gujarat way of becoming the second laboratory of Hindutva forces. It is being pointed that in the absence of any opposition on the ground to such acts of Hindutva groups, the minorities have already been pushed to the margins and things are now moving towards the next step of their existence going totally missing from the political narrative like it happened in the recent Gujarat polls. There is a point of view that there is a sustained effort being made to instil a sense of guilt and inferiority complex among the Muslims by Hindutva organisations. Muslims account for just 7.03 per cent of the state according to the 2011 census while the Hindus are more than 87%. Muslims are mainly concentrated in the districts of Mewat, Gurugram, Palwal and Faridabad. By raising their issues vociferously, the Congress and the INLD along with the new entrant Aam Aadmi Party ( ) probably fear being painted as anti-Hindu in the rest of the state and that too at a time when the state will vote both for the state Assembly and the Lok Sabha over the next few months. Come to think of it, there has not even been a strong political statement coming from these parties at the state level what to talk of action on the ground. There was a general sweeping reply from former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda when this reporter raised he issue at a briefing when he said, “The BJP is always trying to divide people and polarise them.” In fact it is Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh who came out with a strong political statement on the issue. Accusing the BJP of communalising the atmosphere across the country, he said that India is a republic governed by a constitution and neither Khattar, nor anyone else has the right to dictate to the people on where they should or should not hold prayers. Talking in context of Gurugram, Aftab Ahmed who is a senior Congress leader from south Haryana said, “What they do not realise is that Gurugram is a city where people from throughout India come to realise their aspirations. It is a city right next to the national capital and has yet managed to make a mark of its own. Those who offer prayers outside are migrants from other places and they do not cause environmental or sound pollution. If such attempt continue to demonstrate religious supremacy, who would want to come to this city.” He further said that the Muslims in this case are victims of the Hindutva groups peddling religious supremacy instead of a legal recourse if they have any problem. The Muslims have neither held demonstrations nor entered to any altercation. It remains terrified. “The Muslim community has the support of the secular population, the intelligentsia and the fourth pillar of Indian democracy. The fact remains that since the BJP regimes in both Haryana and the Centre have failed to deliver on real issues like employment, health and education, they are resorting to such acts to divert the attention of the people. The much promised Vikas is not happening,” he added. In fact, people have reacted strongly to Khattar's statement. They have been posting on the social media saying that Khattar is right in saying that prayers should be held in mosques. But at the same time there should be an end to the Jagratas, Nagar Kirtans and Sangh Parivar armed marches in public places like parks or on arterial roads. Observers say that an instant political response followed by compelling the law and order machinery to act against the perpetrators of violence is a must for containing such acts. With such acts being reported right from a city next to the national capital, one can imagine the scenario in the hinterland as far as the marginalised groups feeling scared and helpless is concerned.",2018-05-08,, Khattar targets Namaaz: Congress & INLD silence helped CM set the agenda | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/khattar-targets-namaaz-congress-inld-silence-helped-cm-set-the-agenda-112183.html

Politically, this can be seen as the Dalits and the tribals aligning themselves with the Left, a combination that a large number of the people opposed to the   (BJP)-led dispensation at the Centre and the majority of the states seek. To add to BJP's troubles, the issue chosen by SCs and STs for rallying support is the recent Supreme Court decision that allegedly dilutes certain key provisions to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989. The Resistance Day is to be observed under a National Coalition for Strengthening the PoA Act and Its Implementation, an umbrella platform of around 500 Dalit and tribal organisations across India. The coalition is also in touch with SC and ST associations in various government departments and organisations like the banking sector, insurance sector and Indian Railways. “The logic of linking the importance of May Day to the Dalits and tribals is very simple. In India the majority of the working classes are from these two communities --whether it is construction labourer, agricultural labourer or in any other sector. By diluting the SC/ST Act, our 'kavach' and 'kundals' have been taken away like it was done during Mahabharata in the context of Karna. To add salt to the injuries, the BJP governments in various states are showing a lot of hurry in implementing the diluted act,” said social activist Kantibhai Parmar, associated with Gujarat-based organisation Navsarjan. “In India class, caste and gender are closely interlinked. They cannot be separated from each other. Hence the coming together of what is seen as 'Left' along with Dalits and Adivasis should not come as a surprise,” said VA Ramesh Nathan, national convener for the coalition. According to Nathan, there will be day-long peaceful demonstrations in all district headquarters and state Capitals as well as in New Delhi against the Supreme Court's decision to dilute the SC/ST Act. “We have chosen this day, as this day is being celebrated globally for the realisation of the rights of the working class. In India most of the working class belong to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes community. We still need to go a long way for the protection and promotion of the human rights of Dalit, Adivasis, women and children, who have been facing multiple forms of caste-based discrimination and violence. The Resistance Day is to be observed for strengthening the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act and its implementation,” he said. The Coalition has listed 12 major demands against the 'repressive' ruling and on the effective implementation of the said Act that will be highlighted during the 'Resistance Day'. The primary one is that the central government should ensure that either through judicial or parliamentary recourse the status quo of the Act of 1989 is restored to its original position as was before the March 20 judgment. The second demand is that the original Act of 1989 and the Amendment Act of 2015 be included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution so that it may get some protection in the matter of judicial review. The activists are seeking the release of all Dalit and human rights activists, leaders, community members and employees arrested during the 2 April 'Bharat Bandh'. They are also demanding immediate action against those who indulged in firing against the Dalit community members. Another issue that will be raised on 1 May is the establishment of 'Exclusive Special Courts' in line with Section 14 of the SC/ST Act, 1989 in each district and these courts shall not take cases of any other legislation. In addition to this immediate measures are being sought for appointing public prosecutors of the victim’s choice for the speedy trial of the cases. It will be sought that open and transparent investigation be carried out under the Act and prosecution be carried out against those government and police officials who are found to have aided and abetted criminals or are found to have been negligent in their responsibilities in implementing the provisions of the Act. There is a demand that the state governments be asked to immediately frame contingency plan in line with the plan framed by the government of Tamil Nadu along with simultaneous guidelines and schemes under for the purpose of rehabilitation, employment, pension, strengthening socio economic conditions of the victims. Unless this is done the plan would be merely a piece of paper. It is being sought that the National Human Rights Commissions, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribe Commission shall conduct open hearing all over the country on the cases of atrocities and on the implementation of the Prevention of Atrocities Act. These Commissions shall ask for the annual reports from the states and present the same before the Parliament. On 1 May, it will be demanded that the parliament also debate during the sessions on the effective implementation of the Act and constitute a national, state and district level enforcement authority for the effective implementation of the Act. The Coalition wants that the under developed Dalit and Adivasi habitats, habitats prone to atrocities, and habitats that are attacked or damaged are provided land, adequate housing, clean water and sanitation facilities and infrastructure facilities various schemes and Contingency Plan. There is also a demand being aired that the government ensure externment of persons likely to commit offences under the Act in any area included in 'Scheduled Areas' or 'Tribal areas' referred to in Article 244 of the Indian Constitution. While Modi has been promising that his government will not allow 'dilution' of the Prevention of Atrocities Act, there is pressure being exerted by various organisations that the government bring about an ordinance on the matter at the earliest. The BJP is clearly on the back foot on the issue with the Opposition attacking it for letting down the marginalised communities and the upper caste Hindus being annoyed at Modi's overtures to the Dalits and Tribals. Ever since the Supreme Court order came there has been a spurt in the offensive posts and messages being circulated against the Dalits and Tribals on the social media leading to an increased alienation and insecurity among them. Politically, the coming together of Dalits and Left forces is worrisome for the BJP in context of the forthcoming assembly and Lok Sabha polls. How Modi solves this jigsaw puzzle remains to be seen.",2018-04-18,, Dalits and tribals to observe 1 May as Resistance Day: Why this is bad news for BJP | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/dalits-and-tribals-to-observe-1-may-as-resistance-day-why-this-is-bad-news-for-bjp-108645.html
634,Sulagna Sengupta,"The Calcutta High Court Tuesday passed an order validating nominations by candidates via electronic mails. It asked the West Bengal Election Commission to accept nominations for Panchayat election filed by 3 pm on 23 April, reacting to a plea by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The Commission though has decided to move Supreme Court against that. The Division Bench order makes holding polling on 14 May difficult as the commission will now need tota scrutinise the nominations filed over email. After the court order, the   said it would appeal for allowing others to file their nominations via email. Calling the order historic, the party's advocate Pratap Banerjee said: “Around 2,000 nominations could not be filed by various workers of our party due to threats from Trinamool Congress.” The Bench said filing of nominations through email would open up options for voters and reduce risks of loss of life. The legal fraternity seemed to agree that the order was a landmark one, and could give rise to similar demands in other elections across India. “It is historic and can be a legal precedent when situation demands and people are unable to file nominations,” said former Supreme Court judge Ashok Ganguly. “Democracy is in shambles as we heard that people died out of political clash as they could not file nominations. This is not acceptable,” he added. Another senior lawyer said “We feel the state election commission will now be more dutiful.” CPM members expressed satisfaction and said 800 of its candidates couldn't file nominations. Commission officials, however, now face a challenge. They will have to scrutinise fresh nominations and prepare fresh ballots, including for some seats earlier thought to be 'uncontested', a senior official said. This could delay the date of polling. “According to the Panchayat Act, about 21 days are needed between filing of nominations and polling. So it is impossible to hold election on 14 May,” said Makhan Lal Majumder, who was with Bihar Election Commission earlier.",2018-05-08,, Calcutta High Court declares election nominations via email valid | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/calcutta-high-court-declares-election-nominations-via-email-valid-112189.html
635,Neeraj Thakur,"On Saturday, 5 May, Modi told the people of Gadag in Karnataka that he will resolve the three decade long dispute over water-sharing from the Mahadayi river which flows in Karnataka and Goa. The dispute between Karnataka and Goa over sharing water from the Mahadayi and its tributaries began in 1980 when Karnataka witnessed violent protests by farmers in Nargund district, demanding water for irrigating their fields. Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal (MWDT) has been overseeing the issue and has the mandate to deliver a compromise formula between the two states. The tribunal was supposed to deliver its verdict by 2016, but it got a one-year extension, followed by another one-year extension in 2017. According to the latest information, the verdict is expected by August 2018. But going by the past record, there is no surety that the tribunal will give any verdict even in August this year. Second, even if there is a verdict, Modi and his government would not be in any position to get it enforced in Goa, even though it is a BJP-ruled state. Modi's inability was exposed by the statement of Goan water resources minister Vinod Palyekar that his state was not in a position to share Mahadayi river water with Karnataka. This was in contrast to Goa CM  's promise at the behest of Modi and BJP president  , that he would share Mahadayi water with Karnataka. BJP's election manifesto for Karnataka says that if voted to power, their government will provide 24x7 electricity to the people of Karnataka. This promise resonates the famous promise of PM Modi to the people of Uttar Pradesh ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections that he would provide 24x7 power within 60 months. One only needs to look at the long power cuts in the villages of Uttar Pradesh as well as all those states where BJP government is in power to know that a 24x7 electricity supply in India is still a pipe-dream. Barring Delhi (ruled by  ) and Himachal Pradesh (a power surplus state) most states do not get uninterrupted power supply. BJP has promised loan waiver of up to Rs1 lakh owed by farmers; to nationalised banks. At a time of farm distress in the country, such a promise looks appealing to the farmers of Karnataka. However, one only needs to look at the statement of none other than Finance Minister   in June 2017, when he said: “I have already made the position clear that states, which want to go in for these kind of schemes [farm loans waiver] will have to generate them from their own resources. Beyond that the Central government has nothing more to say.” In 2017, many states including Punjab, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh had announced farm loan waivers with the hope that the Centre will help them. Unfortunately, the Union government outrightly rejected their demand. State governments had to shell out money from their own coffers, hindering other development projects. Now, it is difficult to believe that the Centre will give a special treatment to Karnataka, by allocating central funds to help the farmers in the state. Apart from these promises, the voters of Karnataka would do well to remember Modi's habit of refusing to meet his promises by citing technical problems. The case of Andhra Pradesh, that was promised a special status ahead of Lok Sabha polls by BJP, is a case in point. Even after being in power for four years, Modi government refused to fulfill its promise saying that the 14th finance commission had done away with such category in its nomenclature, hence the central government was helpless. Due to this, the disgruntled Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, had to walk out of the NDA alliance earlier this year. The list of broken promises by PM Modi is long, but no review of the unfulfilled promises by his party can be completed without recalling the famous 'jumla' that would have made every Indian richer by Rs 15 lakh. Therefore, every voter in Karnataka needs to take the grand promises by the Santa Claus PM, with a pinch of salt.Prime Minister   has a penchant for promising the moon in his elections rallies. Projecting himself as the Santa Claus of the country, he promises gifts in his election speeches, expecting votes in return. But from the experience of the past four years of his government, it is clear that very few of these gifts get delivered after elections. In the elections rallies in poll-bound Karnataka, Modi is making several new promises every day. Should the people of Karnataka trust him. Here's a look at some of these promises.",2018-05-08,, Karnataka polls: Why voters must take 'Santa Claus' PM Modi with a pinch of salt | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/karnataka-polls-why-voters-must-take-santa-claus-pm-modi-with-a-pinch-of-salt-112192.html
636,Anurag Dey,"During his meeting with Suhag and Kashyap, Shah discussed and briefed them on the achievements and initiatives undertaken by Modi government. “It was a courtesy call, we discussed several issues concerning the common people,” Suhag later told mediapersons. Under the initiative, while Shah will personally contact at least 50 people, Modi will be reaching out to the beneficiaries of various schemes like the Ujjwala Yojana, Kaushal Vikas Yojana, Saubhagya scheme etc. Modi on Monday through the NaMo App, had interacted with the beneficiaries of Ujjwala Yojana, a scheme to provide LPG connections to women while on Tuesday he interacted with beneficiaries Mudra Yojana, a scheme to provide loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises. From Shah to Union ministers and chief ministers down to panchayat members, around 4,000 BJP functionaries will be contacting one lakh recognised faces from diverse fields to sell them the government’s success stories. Although, Shah recently had said a firm “no” to suggestions of early Lok Sabha polls, the BJP machinery had been working overtime for the past several months designing and finalising the outreach programme, signaling its intent of preparing for early general polls. Collating data from various ministries, the BJP has prepared booklets providing details with statistical highlights about how the government has “changed the lives of millions of people” across the country through the wide range of schemes. The booklets with pictures of Shah and Modi on the cover and the party’s new slogan “Saaf Niyat, Sahi Vikas” (clean intent, right development), are being handed over to the people under the programme. Perennially on campaign mode, the BJP has already gone on overdrive endorsing and advertising the achievements of the Modi government on social media. Led by Modi, Union ministers and BJP functionaries have been tweeting statistical highlights of the various schemes.   The BJP official website has also come out with an   on the “4 Years Of Modi government” detailing its achievements in various fields.  The 'Sampark for Samarthan' follows Shah’s meet with all BJP office bearers and Modi’s holding a convention of the national executives of all the 'morchas' (wings) of the party earlier in the month. In both the meetings, the party had brainstormed at length about the upcoming assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and of course the next general Lok Sabha polls. The launch of the programme also coincides with the RSS’ 3-day meeting with top BJP leaders and Union ministers in the national capital. Presided over by RSS joint general secretary Krishna Gopal, the meeting on Monday saw the participation of Shah, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav, Union ministers Rajyavardhan Rathore, JP Nadda and   among others. At the meeting, both the RSS and BJP leaders discussed the performance of the Modi government and the roadmap for the next Lok Sabha polls. Among the agenda in the meeting are the government’s economic, education and labour policies. Smarting from its failure to form the government in Karnataka, the BJP has already started asserting about winning the next Lok Sabha polls with a massive mandate. Shah recently had declared that return to power in 2019 was “not a challenge but a certainty”. Belying the BJP’s assertions is a   which with factual information quoting sources, paints a rather sorry picture of the four years of the Modi government. From India having the “maximum number of unemployed people in the world”, to farmer crisis and the effects of demonetisation, the website gives a detailed analysis of the performance of the country under the Modi led BJP regime.Early general elections now appear to be a possibility with the BJP and its ideological fountainhead- the   (RSS) - steadily gearing up to fight the mega poll battle ahead of 2019. BJP president   launching a massive outreach programme on Tuesday appears to be a part of this preparation to face the poll battle earlier than scheduled. Marking the fourth anniversary of the   government, the initiative christened 'Sampark for Samarthan' (Connect for Support), is a door to door campaign aimed at making people aware of the “transformative initiatives” undertaken by the Centre. Shah, who had recently dismissed the speculation on early general elections, is personally reaching out to eminent personalities to highlight the achievements of the Modi government. He launched the initiative in the national capital by reaching out to former Army chief Dalbir Singh Suhag and constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap.  ",2018-05-29,, BJP launches massive outreach programme: Does this hint at early elections?  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/bjp-launches-massive-outreach-programme-does-this-hint-at-early-elections-115339.html
637,Rajeev Khanna,"In a move to start putting its act together again in Punjab ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) has announced to undertake a youth outreach programme from 2 June onwards. The programme 'Sada youth sab to majboot' (Our youth are the strongest) is to be executed by the youth wing of the party. Ever since its disappointing performance in the 2017 Punjab Assembly polls, the party has been struggling to retain its supporter base in the state. Punjab is a state that had offered AAP a window of opportunity outside its core base of Delhi. It is the state that returned four AAP leaders to the Lok Sabha in 2014 when the 'Modi wave' was at its peak. Apart from these four, the party candidates gave their rivals in the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) a run for their money on several other seats as well. In the subsequent assembly polls, AAP at one point was threatening to walk away with the winner's shield but its over ambitious leaders and hobnobbing with Sikh hardliners turned he scales in favour of the Congress that returned victorious with a brute majority. Still AAP pipped the SAD-  (BJP) combine to emerge as the main Opposition party in the state. But the party has failed to check its slide ever since and has been unable to come up with a performance worth nothing in subsequent by-polls and local body elections. But now with the political scene warming up for the Lok Sabha polls, the party has started making moves again. Punjab still has a lot to offer to the party if it makes the right moves because the disillusionment of the masses with the SAD-BJP combine that brought the Congress to power continues as the government led by Captain Amarinder Singh has failed to rise to the expectations of the people. The issues that formed the narrative for the state assembly polls continue to simmer. It is in this context that the youth outreach programme of the party is significant. According to AAP's sitting MLA from Barnala, Gurmeet Singh, “ Ours is a party that has taken people from the grassroots to the state assembly. The traditional political parties in the state have failed to deliver. We have successfully carried out such outreach drives before also.” He pointed that the burning issues in the state remain unaddressed. Be it the issue of unemployment, providing unemployment allowance, farm crisis or the biggest of them all — the rampant drug menace, they continue to dot the political narrative. On being asked how the party would explain the apology submitted by its national convener and Delhi Chief Minister   to the senior Akali leader Bikramjit Singh Majithia on the issue of the latter's alleged involvement in the drug trade, AAP's youth leader Manjinder Singh Sidhu said that it would be conveyed that submitting of the apology was a tactical move as Kejriwal has to take the party forward across India. “The youth is the spine of every state and it decides the direction in which the things move. The previous governments in Punjab have failed to address the concerns of the youth. Both the Akalis and the Congress have given an opportunity to youth from well off families. It is only AAP that has given an opportunity to youngsters from ordinary families and has taken them from booth level to the state assembly,” he said. Under the new youth outreach programme, AAP's youth leaders will start with meetings at the constituency level from 2 June onwards where it will raise the failures of the central and state governments. On the first day these meetings will be held in Dera Bassi, SAS Nagar and Chamkaur Sahib. In the first phase they plan to cover 15 constituencies by 6 June. Thereafter the programme will be extended right up to every household in the state. The party will have to do some explaining over why many of its leaders have departed over the last several months and why people should continue to extend support to it. AAP leaders said that those who have departed were opportunists who had jumped onto the AAP wagon to serve their vested interests. They claim that their cadre strength is intact although demoralised at present. “ We have to learn from the old mistakes and move forward. We have to approach the people who are demoralised with fresh energy. We are still with the people on the issue of drugs. We have to fight for Punjab,” said Gurmeet. AAP leadership is also playing up the issue of the pollution in the water bodies across the state. The party planned a Yatra on Wednesday from Ludhiana to Chandigarh wherein the cadres would collect water from a polluted source and hand it over to Amarinder asking him to see for himself whether the water is potable. AAP's strength over the last four years has been its raking up of hyper local issues and backing it up with local level protests and other programmes. The party had got a tremendous response at the grass root level ahead of the Assembly polls for the programmes it had chalked up to raise issues like drug menace, farm crisis, supply of spurious seeds, substandard fertilisers etc. It will be trying to deploy the same tactics again ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. The question that remains to be answered is whether it will be able to garner the same support again or not.",2018-05-30,," AAP attempts revival in Punjab, launches youth outreach programme | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/aap-attempts-revival-in-punjab-launches-youth-outreach-programme-115504.html
638,Charu Kartikeya,"That even Shah could not manage to finally deliver the state to his party turned out to be deeply embarrassing for them. Congress and the   (Secular) gave Shah and his party a bitter dose of their own medicine by denying them the chance of forming a government in spite of emerging as the single largest party. The fact that there was nothing illegal about it showed the BJP that it was time the party stopped believing that it alone possesses the tricks that help parties move ahead in the cut-throat arena of politics in India. At the end of the day only one fact remained. While the governing Congress was given a thumbs-down by the electorate, the BJP too failed to win the required confidence of the people. Who was responsible for it is a matter of debate and analysis. What Madhav's arguments indicate that the BJP wants its chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa to bear the burden of failure on his shoulders, so that people do not get the chance to associate it with Shah or Prime Minister  . Why else would he argue that “Assembly elections, especially in states in the country’s south and east, need strong regional leadership” and that “the provincial leadership of the BJP in respective states should be asked to shoulder the greater burden?” However, how does the BJP expect people to believe that? Didn't Shah spend months preparing the party's electoral strategy for Karnataka? He didn't leave anything to chance on the ground too and campaigned in almost all of the 30 districts of the state. Modi, the party's campaigner in chief, was to be the man of the match, a magic batsman of sorts who will come in in the slog overs and take home the trophy for his team.  The PM addressed as many as 21 rallies in the state, as Madhav himself admits, and yet failed to act as the clincher. Average BJP voters are upset that the party failed to upstage Congress even in the underhand tricks department. The loud and clear message of Madhav's piece is that the unexpected turn of events in Karnataka has got the BJP's goat. The party is facing great difficulty in digesting that the Opposition may finally be gaining some ground and beginning to understand what may work for it in 2019. That's the reason why Madhav, Shah and Modi are slamming opposition parties' efforts to unite as an “unholy and unprincipled alliance”. They are telling their followers that thugs are ganging up against them. To win, they are appealing for an overwhelming majority in the next Lok Sabha polls, a 51% mandate, through even bigger numbers than what the party got in 2014. Even the party's most ardent well-wishers are doubting that, as of now.The real objective of   National General Secretary Ram Madhav's purported ode to democracy published in the   appears to be to shield his party's national leadership from criticism over their failure at the hustings in Karnataka. Madhav has tried to cleverly argue that the blame for the BJP's inability to win absolute majority and form the government on its own lies at the doors of the party's state leadership.  The paeans to democracy that accompany his argument appear irrelevant, ironical and contrived, given the history of his own conduct as well as that of his party's. The BJP's attempts at subterfuge in state after state have been amply documented. In the case of Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi and, most recently, Karnataka, the party's underhand tricks were overturned by the courts. In all these cases, the judgements became a source of embarrassment for the high constitutional offices of the President, the Governor and the Chief Election Commissioner. To see Madhav quote ethicists and wax eloquent on democracy for defending this kind of a record is deeply ironical. To cap it all, he himself is known as a poll 'manager' and he recently exposed his own belief in the 'all is fair' principle on live TV. When asked about the party's plan of action if it failed to secure majority in the Karnataka Assembly, a chuckling Madhav told the show's anchors, “Hamare paas   hai”. This was a brazen expression of pride over the reputation that the BJP's national president enjoys, of being adept in bending all kinds of electoral contests in his party's favour.",2018-05-30,, Why Ram Madhav's ode to democracy is an ironical camouflage  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/pov/why-ram-madhav-s-ode-to-democracy-is-an-ironical-camouflage-115508.html
639,Rajeev Khanna,"Aiming for a comeback in both the forthcoming Lok Sabha and state Assembly polls in Haryana, the Congress leadership's present strategy is concentrated on public outreach drives. The party that stands divided in factions continues to launch one outreach drive after the other. It is not only the factions that are out to contact the masses but the frontal organisations as well. The strategy is keeping the party profile propped up in the rural hinterland as a counter to the ongoing 'Jail Bharo Andolan' of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) on the emotive issue of Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal and the roadshows of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar who is going around showering sops and playing up the achievements of the   (BJP) led by him. The latest outreach campaign has been announced by Keshav Chand Yadav, the president of the All India Youth Congress. He announced that the Youth Congress would undertake a Padyatra or a Cycle Yatra in September this year to highlight the failures of both the Khattar government in the state and the   led government at the centre. Yadav said, “The Modi Government at the centre and the Khattar government in Haryana have made the life of people hell. The misrule of the BJP governments has encouraged casteism, communalism, unemployment, price rise and corruption. The people are suffering from maladministration and have made up their minds to throw out these governments.” He claimed the Khattar government is copying Modi's strategy of covering up failures by making tall promises. Yadav's announcement of a Yatra in September followed a 'Congress Ghar Ghar' outreach drive started by the Congress party on the occasion of the party president  's birthday last week. The party's Haryana chief Dr. Ashok Tanwar said that during this campaign, Congress workers will apprise the people that during the four year misrule of 'Jhooth Chander Modi' and 'Ghoshna Lal Khattar', casteism, communalism, unemployment, price rise and corruption have become rampant. “This will be a 'Poll Khol' drive of the BJP government where the main focus will be to expose the failures and anti-people policies of the Khattar Government to the people of Haryana. The Congress workers will also do their utmost to strengthen communal harmony and social fabric and fraternity during this campaign,” Tanwar said. Tanwar has been carrying out a Cycle Yatra in the state to contact the villagers in Haryana's heartland. He announced that the next phase of his 'Haryana Bachao-Parivartan Lao' yatra will be undertaken from July 19 to 22 from Kiloi-Sampla and conclude at Kalanaur. During the yatra two rallies will be organised at Sampla and Kalanaur in Rohtak district. Garhi-Sampla which is the birth place of Deen Bandhu Sir Chhotu Ram along with Baniyani which is Khattar's village will be covered under this phase of the drive. Tanwar will be laying particular emphasis on the mismanagement of water resources by the government. He has been complaining that the Khattar government is allowing more water to neighbouring Rajasthan where polls are due a few months down the line. “We do not oppose giving water to a needy state but the same cannot be done with a political motive and that too by keeping your own state parched,” he said. Khattar government has already been in the line of fire for having recently shelved the Dadupur Nalvi canal project. Tanwar has also been claiming that the BJP had promised to supply uninterrupted power supply in the run up to the last polls, but the fact is that in the rural areas people are getting electricity only for 2-4 hours. Tanwar has been countering the BJP's publicity blitz both on the ground and also on the social media. He had recently joined issue with Modi on the fitness challenge by throwing a challenge to Modi and Khattar and his cabinet colleagues to cycle for a day in Haryana. He said, “By cycling for a day in Haryana you will see your promise of 'Achhe Din' in the state.” On the other hand former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has been continuing with his own public outreach campaigns. After the demonetisation fiasco of the Modi government and shoddy implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) he began with kisan panchayats that were followed by Dalit panchayats and vyapaari sammelans. It was in February this year that he launched the his 'Jan Kranti Yatra' which he intends to continue right till the polls. He has been trying to portray the Khattar and Modi governments as 'Event management governments' and has been highlighting the economic down slide both at the national and state levels in his interaction with the people. He has been hitting out at the government for interfering in the functioning of autonomous institution. For now the Congress is moving ahead as a divided force with various factions carrying out their own drives. Both Hooda and Tanwar have been avoiding each other and are yet to come on a common platform. But sooner or later the party will have to come under a unified command if it wants to make electoral gains and this divided house is also becoming a challenge for Rahul Gandhi. The sooner he overcomes this, the better.",2018-06-25,," Despite divisions, Congress launches public outreach to revive itself in Haryana | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/despite-divisions-congress-launches-public-outreach-to-revive-itself-in-haryana-119525.html

641,Anurag Dey,"Party leaders are now claiming the programme to be a success having swayed popular opinion in BJP’s favour. “The outreach initiative is a massive success. The narrative of unemployment, price rise or agrarian crisis has been overshadowed and people are talking about the huge achievements and successes of the Modi government,” said a BJP leader. “All the personalities, to whom we are reaching out, command a high place in the society and are all convinced by the great work done by the Modi government. This has led to people around them getting influenced. The result is people are talking about how every village in India has electricity and not about unemployment,” added the leader. While the BJP functionary may boast about the success of the outreach programme, the question remains about the efficacy of the entire campaign particularly for the fact that whether the celebrities leaving aside their busy schedule, would come out endorsing Modi and his government. The outreach programme surely is grabbing eyeballs and providing photo opportunity for Shah and the likes, but it is only to be seen whether the efforts yield the desired result for the BJP in its next big battle. At a time when Opposition parties are steadily closing ranks, the much vaunted “Modi wave” which propelled the BJP to power in 20 states, also appears to be on the wane, particularly in the wake of recent bye-polls. Dealing a blow to the BJP, Opposition parties emerged victorious in 11 out of 14 Lok Sabha and Assembly bye-polls, including the high-profile Kairana Parliamentary seat in Uttar Pradesh. The outreach programme is also crucial for the BJP which is up against huge anti-incumbency in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh- three states which are slated to go to the hustings later in the year. While the BJP may harp on the positives and achievements of its government, but it has failed entirely in giving answers to the questions raised by the Opposition and the common man. The statistical jamboree provides facts such as how much loan has been given to the youth for self-employment or the millions of women who have been benefited under the LPG scheme. But it remains eerily silent on the question of rising unemployment, on the question of growing agrarian distress and farmers suicides or the rising fuel prices.   It’s not just eminent personalities, Shah used the initiative also to mollify disgruntled allies,   and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). Having lost an important ally in Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the BJP chief met Thackeray in Mumbai where he is said to have discussed several issues. It may the oldest BJP ally, but the Shiv Sena, but it has not missed any opportunity to have a go at Modi and his policies. Be it the Prime Minister’s China visit or ceasefire violations by Pakistan or fuel prices, Thackeray and his Sena has been attacking Modi left, right and Centre. The meet came days after the two parties fought a bitter bye-poll in the Palghar Lok Sabha constituency which the BJP won. Shah also met SAD patriarch and former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in Chandigarh. It may not be as critical as the Sena but SAD too has been expressing its displeasure with BJP’s ways and asking it to “treat its partners better”. While the BJP may be hoping Shah’s talks would help in diffusing tensions between the allies, the party is yet to get a positive response either from the Sena or the SAD. In fact, Sena just after Shah’s meeting raised suspicions on why former President   was invited to a RSS event. The Sena said that the “RSS was preparing itself for a situation where it might project Mukherjee as Prime Minister if the BJP fails to get required numbers"". Shah who has 50 personalities on his list, met former army chief Dalbir Singh Suhag, former cricketer Kapil Dev, Olympian Milkha Singh, actress  , industrialist Ratan Tata, Union minister   met actors Nana Patekar and Salman Khan. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman met former cricketer VVS Laxman and tennis ace  , Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath met actor Sanjay Dutt. While the prominent leaders have been meeting the who’s who, party cadres have been entrusted with spreading the message at the grassroots. Meeting with farmers and commoners, party activists are informing them about the various central schemes and how the BJP government has been working to change their lives.  In the fifth and final year of its term, the   led BJP government has nothing much to show on the ground. Battling rising unemployment, spiraling prices, agrarian crisis and reverses in recent bye-elections, going has been getting tough for the BJP. And now the saffron party is banking upon star quotient and propaganda to bolster its fortunes ahead of the 2019 mega battle. While political parties often field celebrities as candidates in elections, the BJP has undertaken a massive campaign reaching out to cine and sports stars, religious leaders, business magnates, jurists and other prominent faces from the society to hard-sell Modi government’s “achievements”. Packed with statistics and graphs collated data from across ministries, the initiative christened 'Sampark for Samarthan' (Connect for Support), is a door to door campaign about “transformative initiatives” undertaken by the Centre. Having reached out to the likes of Bollywood superstars  ,  , sports icons Milkha Singh, Kapil Dev, former CJI RC Lahoti among others, the BJP firmly believes each one of them could influence the opinions of people around them. It not just the 'Sampark for Samarthan' campaign but the BJP has gone overboard using various media to endorse the government’s “success stories”. Going through testing times, the party known for its reliance on propaganda, has fallen back on the tried and tested formula. From TV, movie theaters to the social media and the internet, all are flooded with advertisements of Modi and the achievements of his regime. The extravagant propagandist that he is, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too has joined the bandwagon. Interacting with selective beneficiaries of Ujjwala Yojana, Mudra Yojana, Awas Yojana etc., Modi has been endorsing how the various government schemes have “transformed” lives of Indians.  ",2018-06-12,, Will BJP’s Sampark for Samarthan outreach be more than just a photo-op? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/will-bjp-s-sampartk-for-samarthan-outreach-be-more-than-just-a-photo-op-117654.html
642,Charu Kartikeya,"Just days ago, her former colleague Barkha Dutt also tweeted that she received “veiled threats” that “sections of the Establishment” will “use any tool” to stop her from working. Another senior journalist Ravish Kumar, also working for NDTV, has been saying for at least three years now that he regularly receives death threats. Kumar said just last month that the threats have now gone up  . Independent journalist and author Rana Ayyub has also reportedly received multiple threats  . The most chilling evidence of what these threats can transform into was the assassination of senior journalist Gauri Lankesh in Bengaluru, in September 2017. The entire conspiracy behind her murder is yet to be unraveled but Karnataka police have made some key arrests. For several years, India has figured low on global indices of press freedom and the ranking fell further this year. The increasing incidence of intimidation that journalists keep reporting would have been a cause of alarm for state machinery in any responsible democracy. However, the NDA government under Prime Minister   is yet to take any cognisance of this trend. The Union Home Ministry and the organisations under it have not even announced any move to tackle this threat, let alone take any action. In stark contrast, Union Home Minister   promptly convened a high-level meeting of the security establishment following unconfirmed reports of vague death threats to the PM. Pune police claimed that they recovered a letter purportedly written by Maoists, talking about a “Rajiv Gandhi type incident”. The police did not reveal what was done to establish authenticity of the letter and identity of its writer and addressee. The letter didn't even mention Modi or PM but it was enough for leaders of the governing BJP across the country to stir up emotions in the name of a concocted plot to assassinate the PM. The Home Minister has even announced that the PM's security will be stepped up. Having witnessed the assassination of not one but two prime ministers, India can not afford to take even a hint of a death threat to the PM lightly. However, this phantom that the regular intimidation of journalists in the country has is no less deserving of prompt attention. Yet, the PM, the Home Minister and all those who have been feeling alarmed over the purported death threat to Modi have been consistently silent on the murder and intimidation of journalists. Is it because all these journalists do not hesitate from pointing out the Modi government's failures and the governing party's divisive agenda? Is it because that these journalists do not toe the government’s line, unlike many of their colleagues in other organisations who are carrying out the government's propaganda day in and day out? If yes, then the government should clearly spell that out so that the threatened journalists do not live in any false hope that the State and its agencies will protect them. If no, then the State must intervene immediately and tackle the intimidation of journalists seriously. Most of the threatened journalists have lodged FIRs that are calling out loud for attention and follow-up. Prompt action must be initiated to conduct professional and time-bound probe and identify those guilty.NDTV's Executive Editor Nidhi Razdan has become the latest entry in a long list of journalists to face criminal intimidation. Razdan recently announced on twitter that she got a death threat via Instagram, the photo-sharing website owned by Facebook. Just days ago, her former colleague Barkha Dutt also tweeted that she received “veiled threats” that “sections of the Establishment” will “use any tool” to stop her from working.  https://mobile.twitter.com/BDUTT/status/1004609085533122561?p=v    ",2018-06-12,, Let journalists get raped and killed.

643,Sulagna Sengupta,"  Congress President   met a divided West Bengal Pradesh Congress on Friday on the question of political alliance with the All India Trinamool Congress for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. A group led by Congress MP Abu Hasem Khan Chowhdury, brother of late Malda strongman ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury batted for an alliance with AITC, while the group led by Pradesh Congress Chief Adhir Chowdhury opposed any kind of alliance with the ruling party saying that it would lead to total destruction of the party in Bengal. The latter section is said to favour an alliance with the Left Front. Sources in Congress said that the AICC chief Rahul Gandhi is yet to take a call on the pros and cons of aligning with Trinamool Congress or aligning with the Left for the Lok Sabha elections. During the meeting, Bengal Congress leaders spoke with Gandhi individually and expressed their views. While a section of Congress leaders like Abu Hasem Khan Chowdhury, Mausam Noor, Somen Mitra, MLA Moinul Haque are in favour of aligning with Trinamool Congress. They feel that this would enable the party to get the maximum number of seats in 2019. However, leaders like Deepa Das Munshi, Manoj Chakraborty and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury are not in favour of aligning with AITC. Congress MLA Moinul Haque said “If we want to defeat the BJP we have to go for an alliance with Trinamool Congress in Bengal. We can speak with Trinamool Congress regarding seat sharing. Only such an arrangement will lead to a healthy tally for the Congress in 2019”. Senior Congress leader Somen Mitra, who was briefly in AITC, said “ We feel that presently it is difficult for the win many seats number of seats on its own, especially with the BJP gaining grounds in Bengal. I do not support an alliance with CPI(M). This arrangement was tried in 2016 and we couldn't win. Therefore it is necessary to align with AITC. I have expressed my view to the Congress president.” According to Congress leader Deepa Dasmunshi, aligning with Trinamool Congress is not an option. “West Bengal Congress can win on its own might,” she said. According to Manoj Chakraborty, “ In 2016 Assembly elections, in around 72,000 booths, the difference in vote share wasn't very high. The Congress and Left Front alliance may have failed to come to power in 2016 but they got nearly 39% votes. The Congress High Command should look into the possibility of an alliance with CPI(M).” Even though he is against an alliance with AITC, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury says that all the leaders will “respect the decision of the Congress president”.  ",2018-07-06,, Fight for survival: Rahul Gandhi meets leaders of a divided West Bengal Congress | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/fight-for-survival-rahul-gandhi-meets-leaders-of-a-divided-west-bengal-congress-121270.html
644,Anurag Dey,"  Turning on the heat on the Ram Mandir-Babri Masjid dispute in Ayodhya, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has declared that a mosque at the disputed site was unacceptable to it. The radical right wing organisation also said that it is pressurising the  -led central government to pass a law for building the Ram Temple in case the Supreme Court which is adjudicating the dispute, fails to deliver its verdict by 2018. The Ayodhya issue was the core agenda at the VHP’s Governing Council meeting where it resolved to urge the apex court for hearing the case on a day-to-day basis and delivers the verdict by October when it intends to start building a grand Ram temple at Ayodhya. The two-day meeting at the national capital which concluded on Monday (June 25), was the first after the change of leadership earlier in the year. In April former Rajasthan High Court judge VS Kokje was elected as the international president. He defeated former VHP chief Pravin Togadia’s aide Raghav Reddy. Informing about the agenda of the meeting, VHP Working President Alok Kumar said building the Ram Temple at Ayodhya was the organisation’s prime objective. “The Supreme Court has already clarified that it is treating the case as a title dispute and adjudicate only about the ownership of the disputed land. Whether a mosque should be built or not at the site, does not come under its jurisdiction. Any mosque at the disputed site is not and will not be acceptable to us,” said Kumar. While insisting that the VHP wanted the Ram temple to be built legally, Kumar said that in case there is delay by the Supreme Court in giving verdict, it will then decide on the future course of action. “We are keenly observing the proceedings before the Supreme Court and we urge it to hear the case on a day to day basis. We will observe till July and if we see that the court doesn’t appear to be in a position to deliver the verdict in 3-4 months, we will talk to seers from across the country and then chalk out the future course of action. “We want the judicial process to end in a timely manner and want the temple to be built either through court order or through a law. We will push the Centre for enacting a law for building the temple in case there is delay in the SC,” he said. Kumar also took a swipe at ousted VHP chief Togadia and his newly launched outfit Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP). “Any organisation which is created out of jealousy, personal ambition and copying doesn’t last for long. I have seen the posters of his new outfit, the logo and the name are copied from the VHP. We don’t think his organisation can do us any harm,” said Kumar. Asked if there was any chance of a reconciliation with the estranged Togadia, Kumar replied: “the doors are open, it is for him to decide”. Togadia who has been attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP for ditching the issue of Ram temple, has asserted his new outfit is aimed at consolidating Hindu votes in the country and present a political alternative to the BJP ahead of the next general elections. Launching his outfit on June 24, Togadia said the AHP’s priorities are building Ram Temple in Ayodhya and bringing a law to ban nationwide cow slaughter- two of the prime objectives of the VHP. At the Governing Council meeting, the VHP also passed a resolution seeking a “Ministry for Cow Progeny Protection, Preservation and Promotion”, both at the Centre and all states. It also demanded that a law banning cow slaughter be enforced in the entire country. The VHP said the Constitution under the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) provides for banning cow slaughter, as such the Centre should honour that and endeavor to create a cow ministry. The VHP also passed a resolution declaring the influx of Rohingya Muslims in the country as threat to both internal and external security. To deal with the issue of Rohingya “infiltration”, the VHP demanded the government to enact a law providing push back of the all the Rohingyas, completely seal the Indo-Bangladesh border and deploy additional security forces along with the BSF at the borders. It also demanded that a Parliamentary Committee be formed that shall deal with the infiltration issue on an urgent basis and deport the infiltrators without delay. The VHP also urged the people of the country to socially and economically boycott Rohingyas and hand them over to the police.  ",2018-06-25,," Mosque on disputed site in Ayodhya unacceptable, SC must decide in time: VHP | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/mosque-on-disputed-site-in-ayodhya-unacceptable-sc-must-decide-in-time-vhp-119526.html
645,Sulagna Sengupta,"  The Congress is not only the only party in West Bengal which is facing desertions, the CPI(M) too is facing similar problems. Barely a day after MP Ritabrata Banerjee joined the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), another senior CPI(M) leader and former Murshidabad MP Moinul Hassan declared on Saturday that he is quitting the party. He had spent 42 years in the party. Sources in the CPI(M) said that differences of opinion compelled Hassan to take this decision. Hassan said “I left the party as party leaders did not want to take my opinion. I always said that BJP is gaining ground across India and trying to strengthen its base in West Bengal. To oust BJP from the Centre, there needs to be a grand alliance of all parties. But CPI(M) doesn't share this point of view. It is not even conceding that BJP is a fascist party”. “BJP is out principal opponent but the (West Bengal) CPI(M) does not agree,” he added. According to Hassan, “In Muslim dominated villages CPI(M) has failed reach out to the people as there is a lack of ground workers. On several occasions, I urged the party leadership to hold meetings in villages, but no one paid heed”. Hassan feels that the CPI(M) blundered by treating all its opponents in the same manner. “A different approach is needed towards different rivals,” he said. Hassan said that while he is quitting CPI(M), he would remain in politics. “I quit CPI(M), but not politics. I will remain in politics till my last breath. Quitting CPI(M) is like leaving my own home, but I don’t have any other option now.” Although Hassan did not clearly say whether or not he is going to join Trinamool Congress, the party said that many senior CPI(M) and Congress leaders are likely to join it in the near future. State parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said “ Many senior leaders of both Congress and CPI(M) have expressed their desire to join our party . They will be joining officially after the our party's rally on 21 July.” On Friday, Trinamool Congress appointed expelled CPI(M) leader Ritabrata Banerjee as the chairman of the newly constituted tribal development commission.  ",2018-07-07,," Former MP Moinul Hassan quits CPI(M), says party refuses to acknowledge BJP threat | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/former-mp-moinul-hassan-quits-cpi-m-says-party-refuses-to-acknowledge-bjp-threat-121443.html
646,Anurag Dey,"The Centre’s ruling BJP is facing flak over the appointment of Justice AK Goel as National Green Tribunal (NGT) chairman, which has not just caused severe heartburn among Dalits but also triggered discontent among NDA Dalit MPs, who are now demanding his removal. Justice Goel, who retired from the Supreme Court earlier in the month, was part of the two-judge bench which laid down stringent safeguards to prevent the “abuse” of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, thereby diluting the law. The 20 March judgment by the bench of Justices Goel and UU Lalit led to a massive nationwide outrage among the Dalits who also observed a Bharat Bandh in protest. The bench in the verdict acknowledged instances of “abuse of the Act by vested interests” and removed the mandate of immediate arrest and made “preliminary inquiry” and “sanction by the competent authority” prerequisites for arresting an accused. It also removed the bar on an accused taking recourse to anticipatory bail. Following his retirement from the apex court in July, Goel was named as the NGT chief drawing immediate protests from Dalits and Dalit rights activists who claimed the appointment was a “reward” by the   government for the anti-Dalit verdict. Goel becoming the NGT chairman amounted to adding insult to the injury of Dalits, who were already anguished over the Supreme Court verdict and the Narendra Modi government’s delayed response in filing a review petition. It’s not just common Dalits but even SC/ST legislators within the BJP-led NDA are peeved at the decision and are now demanding his removal. Over two dozen SC/ST MPs from various NDA constituents and the BJP met Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Tuesday to discuss the issue. Among those to attend the meeting included Union ministers Arjun Ram Meghwal from the BJP and Ramdas Athawale from Republican Party of India (A). BJP MP Vinod Sonkar was also present. “At the meeting there was consensus among all, that Goel’s appointment as the NGT chairman is not appropriate and is against the sentiments of Dalits. It was decided that Goel cannot be allowed to continue on the post. As such Paswan will be meeting both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ramnath Kovind seeking Goel’s removal,” said Sonkar who is also the chief of the BJP’s SC Morcha. Following the meeting, Paswan admitted before the media that Goel’s appointment to the post sent a “wrong message”. Another Dalit leader and BJP MP Udit Raj too expressed concern over the issue saying Goel’s appointment has saddened Dalits. “Dalits have been in unease over the Supreme Court’s March 20 judgment diluting SC/ST Act. Dalits are sad that Judge A.K. Goel, who gave the judgment, has been made NGT chairman,” Raj told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. BJP in a quandary Amidst the growing clamour for Goel’s removal, the BJP finds itself in a tricky situation especially in view of the next Lok Sabha polls. While admitting that the Goel’s appointment may have backfired, party sources said it was unlikely that the demand for the sacking of NGT chief will be accepted. “The appointment has caused unnecessary controversy, it is unfortunate that Goel’s appointment is being perceived as a message for the BJP being anti-Dalit which is not true at all. Neither such appointments nor removal are guided by political considerations, therefore it is unfair to demand his removal over political reasons. Removing from a statutory post require solid grounds,” said a party source. “His appointment has caused enough controversy and I don’t think the party or the government can afford some more by acceding to the demands of his removal. However, the decision rests with the Prime Minister and the President,” added the source. The issue has cropped up at a time when BJP which is increasingly looking to woo Dalits with an eye on the next Lok Sabha polls. Also it comes at a time when the review petition by the Modi government is pending before the Supreme Court. Whether or not the government accedes to the demand of Goel’s removal will have a huge bearing not just on the BJP’s own Dalit MPs but also those from the allies, especially the LJP and Paswan considered the NDA’s most prominent Dalit face.",2018-07-25,, NDA Dalit MPs slam Modi govt over Justice Goel's appointment as NGT chief | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/nda-dalit-mps-slam-modi-govt-over-justice-goel-s-appointment-as-ngt-chief-124532.html
647,Sulagna Sengupta,"Despite her claims of being a crusader for honest and corruption-free governance, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has taken her office out of the purview of the West Bengal Lokayukta Bill 2018. The Bill is set to be placed in the West Bengal Assembly on 28 July. Section 9(a) of the Bill mentions that “notwithstanding anything contained in any of the provisions of this Act shall not investigate into any matter involved in or arising from or connected with any allegation of corruption against the chief minister relating to public order.” The Bill also stipulates that if any action has to be taken against a public servant, the state government's permission has to be taken. Section 9 (b) of the Bill mentions that “notwithstanding anything contained in any of the provisions of this Act shall not investigate into any matter any of the complaint against a public servant without prior approval of the state government.” Despite criticism that it would harm the fight against corruption, the state government has defended these amended clauses. According to state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee, “It is necessary to make some amendments in the Bill 2003 for effective implementation. In the West Bengal Lokayukta Bill 2003, there was no provision for taking action against public servants accused of corruption, but the amended Bill says that the Lokayukta can take action against public servants after taking permission from the state government”. Justice Samaresh Banerjee was the first Lokayukta of West Bengal. After his retirement, the Left Front government and later the Trinamool Congress government did not appoint any Lokayukta. Opposition parties have said that the new amendments are “black clauses” and they would not be supporting the Bill. Congress leader Abdul Mannan said, “We oppose the clauses in the Bill which state that action cannot be taken against chief minister if he or she is accused of corruption. It will end up shielding the corrupt”. CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty, said “The Bill will only have a negative impact in the minds of people"".

648,Rajeev Khanna,"The popularity of Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat seems slipping. So much so that people of the hilly state have started doubting whether he can complete his term. Several BJP leaders reportedly have been unhappy, but are yet to come out in the open as they fear the wrath of the party's National President   and Prime Minister  . Uttarakhand already has a dubious distinction of having nine chief ministerial changes in its short life of 18 years. Barring Narayan Datt Tewari, the first elected CM, none have been able to complete a five-year term. The unpopularity of Rawat can be gauged from the two episodes that made headlines in the state last week and were shared widely on the social media. The first was his ordering the detention and suspension of a school teacher at his 'Janta Darbar'. The teacher had sought a transfer to Dehradun after having served in a remote district for more than two decades. He was punished after a heated exchange with the CM with the latter showing absolute “insensitivity”. He has come in for massive criticism from across the cross section of society, particularly when it came to light that his own wife has been posted in Dehradun for the last 22 years and so has been the case of wives of other BJP ministers and members of Parliament who have been enjoying postings at places of their convenience. The second episode was again of a woman hurling abuses and threats at him when he went to the spot of a bus accident in Dhumakot where 48 people had died after an overloaded bus had tumbled in a gorge. So what makes Rawat unpopular? He was chosen to head the state government after a resounding victory of the   (BJP) in the Assembly polls in March 2017 due to his long association with the   (RSS) and his proximity to both Modi and Shah. The party won 57 of the 70 seats, decimating the Congress. But there are questions galore on his performance. There is a major resentment among the leaders in his own party, particularly the heavyweights who had left the Congress and had contested successfully on the BJP ticket in the Assembly polls. Sources say that these leaders have been ruing in private how their works are being stalled in the government. Another reason is his not appointing two ministers against existing vacancy. “The government has been in existence for one and a half years; yet these posts are vacant. The same is the case with ministerial level posts that are lying vacant in different bodies. “Only four such appointments have been made to these bodies and the latest appointment of Usha Negi to the constitutional position of chairperson of the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has been controversial as she is said to be his distant relative,” pointed a political observer based in Dehradun. The elected leaders who are being denied their pound of flesh are seething in anger pointing that what face would they show to their supporters and with what enthusiasm would the latter work for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls if such a scenario continues for long. Among those who have reportedly complained is the former BJP state unit chief Bishan Singh Chauphal.  “You have people people who have won up to eight polls in their life not getting any ministerial berth or an equivalent post in any body in the state. Their anger is on expected lines,” said the observer. The agitated leaders do not buy the argument that giving posts to a few would offend the others in the party. They say that their cadres and they themselves worked hard to secure a poll victory and this needs to be rewarded to keep morale high.  According to a source, the BJP's victory in Gujarat and the recent Tharali bye-election gave some reprieve to Rawat and as of now he continues to enjoy the support of Modi and Shah despite opposition to him. “But much will depend on the performance of the party in the Lok Sabha polls if they decide to go into the battle without any change and he would have completed half his tenure by then,” the source added. For the last one week speculation have been rife about who can replace Rawat. Among the various names doing the rounds, senior cabinet minister Prakash Pant seems to be a frontrunner. Several people have also pointed out the disconnect between the CM and the masses. The local media now holds his media adviser, Ramesh Bhatt, for letting the CM down on several occasions. Journalists have complained about how Bhatt has been throwing his weight around. According to sources, Bhatt has been issuing 'orders' to journalists, especially those with the electronic media, to avoid reporting the duel between the teacher and Rawat unflatteringly. Many reporters alleged that he was more keen for his own publicity than for the CM.",2018-07-07,, Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Rawat's popularity on decline.

Mitra, who runs the Pioneer daily, has been a Rajya Sabha member from the saffron party. But of late he had reportedly fallen out of favour with the current party leadership. He, however, told Catch News: “I don’t have any grievance. The BJP put me in its national executive and also sent me to the Rajya Sabha twice. I held important positions in the party.

In 2014, he unsuccessfully contested from the Hooghly Lok Sabha seat in Bengal.

650,Rajeev Khanna,"'s (BJP) national president   chose the occasion of Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJP's initial avatar) ideologue Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's 'martyrdom day' to start the process of reclaiming the lost support of his party in the Jammu and Ladakh regions of Jammu and Kashmir. The BJP recently withdrew support to the   led Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with which it had allied after the 2014 Assembly polls. The state has been placed under the President's rule. Ironically, Shah sounded apologetic on the occasion which has been used by the BJP to propagate its ideology among the masses with vigor for decades across the country. In the past it was an occasion for the party to propagate how the BJP was a party with a difference. But this time, Shah confined his much awaited address in Jammu on Saturday evening to convey to the people of the Jammu and Ladakh regions which had elected BJP candidates to the state Assembly that the reason why the withdrew support to the Mufti government was that the Jammu and Ladakh were not getting their due share in the development and were being ignored. He also tried to use the occasion to paint the Congress leadership black accusing it of plundering the state in connivance with thee two families, the Abdullahs and the Muftis. He continued with the campaign of depicting the recent statements of Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Saifuddin Soz as anti-India and asked Congress president   to apologise for them. “Look at the statement of Ghulam Nabi Azad. I cannot even repeat it. Lashkar (militant organization Lashkar-e-Toiba) supports it. I want to ask the Congress president Rahul Gandhi what kind of frequency matching is there between the Congress and Lashkar.. I want to tell Saifuddin Soz that even if you take 100 rebirths BJP will never allow separation of Jammu and Kashmir.” Shah played up the recent killings of senior journalist Shujaat Bukhari and security personnel Aurangzeb besides the discrimination against the Jammu and Ladakh regions. “Under the PDP government, a newspaper editor was murdered. Children took up stone-pelting. Attacks on army and security forces increased. We could not be part of such a government. The  -led central government gave several financial packages amounting to Rs 80,000 crore to the state. Modi came here over a dozen times. But Jammu and Ladakh were discriminated against. If development is not balanced and Jammu does not progress, we decided that we cannot be part of this government,” he said. Shah tried to convey that only BJP is a nationalist and a patriotic party. “BJP is a patriotic party. We don’t care about power, we care about the development of the state,” he said. He targeted those questioning a change of gears in anti-terror operations in Jammu and Kashmir following the imposition of President's rule. “Media is creating its own narrative, linking anti-terror operations to the Governor’s rule. I appeal to the media to change the narrative. Ours is a narrative of development,” he claimed while asking the people to let the security forces do their job while they focus on development. He claimed that maximum number of terrorists have been killed under the Modi government. In his speech Shah elaborated at length on the discrimination faced by the Jammu and Ladakh regions. He said,“The Centre approved AIIMS (all India Institute of Medical Sciences) for both Jammu and Kashmir but the PDP government did not allocate land for AIIMS in Jammu. It is our right to demand our share.” Similarly he accused the PDP government of not utilizing Rs 400 crore allocated for building bunkers along the International Border. He attacked the Mehbooba government for not initiating the process of delimitation that would have proved beneficial for the Jammu region. He said that no steps were taken towards granting Scheduled Tribe status to Gujjars and Bakarwals. The BJP is trying to regain its support base in Jammu and Ladakh regions. Its popularity in these regions had dipped considerably during the time it shared power with the PDP in the state. In 2014 the party had won 25 seats in the assembly polls and all of them were in Jammu region that sends 37 legislators to the house of 87 members. While 87 members are elected directly, two are nominated to the house. Sources say the party would be wiped out in the Jammu region if polls are held today. The party in any case has no support in the Valley. This scenario has made the BJP leadership jittery as both the Lok Sabha and assembly polls are not very far away. The party joining hands with the PDP, a party that it opposed tooth and nail, had left its supporters disillusioned. “It could not get the Article 370 removed and it could not deliver on its promises on recruitment and jobs to the people who elected its candidates in the Jammu region as it has confessed. There was no let up in the militancy. It stands alienated. It is back to the politics of polarisation,” said local Congress leader Ravinder Sharma. The party has also been drawing flak on continuing shelling from across the International Border in the Jammu region. The shelling has seen a spurt in the recent days and has led to further fleeing of people from their villages. The people have been demanding more bunkers. There are villages where people just go in the day time to take the cattle out for grazing or to attend to their fields only to return to safer locations for the night. Sources say that many local BJP leaders have been facing hostility from the local population in such areas. They talk with sarcasm about the BJP's pre-poll talk of killing ten enemies for every one casualty of Indian security personnel.",2018-06-23,, An apologetic Amit Shah tries to regain BJP's lost base in Jammu and Ladakh | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/an-apologetic-amit-shah-tries-to-regain-bjp-s-lost-base-in-jammu-and-ladakh-119256.html
652,Speed News Desk,"I cannot claim intimacy with Atal Bihari Vajpayee. I knew him for over four decades. He had an engaging personality, verbal spontaneity, sense of humour, he was free of pomposity, was approachable, literary, had a first-rate political judgement, was an orator of the highest calibre and a skilful, disarming superb parliamentarian. I had first met him in the early 1970s. I was Ambassador to Poland. He had come to Warsaw as a member of a Parliamentary delegation. Unlike most of his colleagues he did not make outrageous demands. He was dignified and did not throw his weight around. I had a couple of worthwhile conversations with him, both about Poland and her relations with Soviet Union. I told him that Poland attached considerable importance to Indo-Polish relations, but had no independent foreign policy. The foreign policy of the East European countries, was dictated by Moscow. However, in private the Poles were not over fond of the Soviets. Atal ji left a good impression on me and his Polish hosts. He was for a short period External Affairs Minister in Morarji Desai’s rickety government. During his tenure he visited Lusaka, capital of Zambia. I took him to meet President Kaunda, who over did his praise of the Indian High Commissioner. Vajpayee did not share the enthusiasm of the Zambian President. On leaving the President’s residence, I asked the driver to drop the External Affairs Minister at his hotel. He said to me in Hindi,” aap mujhe apne ghar nahin le jainge…” (Will you not take me to your house?) I said no, not after the way your government has been treating me. “Natwar Singh is Indira Gandhi’s man etc”. From London I had been abruptly posted to Zambia. My monthly reports to the Ministry were filed not read. Vajpayee ji insisted, “I want to meet your wife. Your mother-in-law asked me to see her.” It was not the cell phone age. I telephoned my wife from the reception desk telling her to prepare lunch. For half an hour we sat in Vajpayee ji’s suite. The lunch was not a success. I did not let my diplomatic guard down. I was formal, stiff and mostly silent. He enjoyed the meal, chatted with my wife, talked about her mother. When I finally got back to Delhi in 1982 after my Islamabad posting, I saw him from time to time. He was critical of our Pakistan policy in particular. He asked about President Zia. “Why did he hang Bhutto.” I enlightened him, “Zia was a small and vengeful man.” After a minor but open tiff we got on very well. This was at an all-party meeting on Iraq in Parliament House (probably in 2001). The Congress was represented by  ,   and myself. The PM held forth on the merits of his Iraq policy. I politely contradicted him. Uncharacteristically he retorted, “Natwar Singh ji ko adat hai hamari policy ko criticize karneki”. I could have replied but restrained myself. Three days later there was a meeting at 7 Race Course Road. I was present. After the meeting as I was leaving the room, a man ran after me, “PM is calling you, Sir”. When we met, the great man won me over for life. I give the English translation of what he said, “The other day I said to you, more than I should. Please do not take it to heart.” Here is large-hearted greatness for you. His passing away, ends an era. He was an exceptional statesman.  By - K. Natwar SinghWhat is the criteria for calling someone a great man? Isaiah Berlin, the Oxford philosopher/historian’s definition is in my judgement ideal. Berlin wrote, “To call someone a great man is to claim that he has intentionally taken a large step, one far beyond the normal capacities of men, in satisfying, or materially affecting, central human interests… Permanently and radically alters the outlook and values of a significant body of human beings.”",2018-08-21,, A Great Son Of Mother India An Exceptional Statesman | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/a-great-son-of-mother-india-an-exceptional-statesman-129033.html
653,Catch Team,"The state government and the governing   (United)-  coalition have drawn flak over the Muzaffarpur case because of government largesse towards prime accused Brajesh Thakur. The Hajipur case, however, has the potential to reverse that narrative and put the Opposition on the mat. Nidan, the non-government organisation that runs Alpawas, is headed by a man who also dons the cap of the head of one of the Congress party's national cells: Arbind Singh, executive director of Nidan, also chairs the All-India Unorganised Workers Congress. This special All-India Congress Committee (AICC) cell was launched by Congress President   last November and is believed to be one of the projects close to his heart. Singh is believed to be close to Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken. The JD(U) has already tried to create an uproar over Thakur's alleged links with Congress parliamentarian and former Union minister Akhilesh Singh. Alpawas and Nidan may become another source of embarrassment for the Grand Old Party. Bihar Congress chief Kaukab Qadri told Catch that since his party has been constantly raising its voice to hold the state government accountable for the Muzaffarpur case, it would not hesitate from acting if any Congress leader was found to be involved in any such case.  He added that though AICC officials were beyond his jurisdiction, he would discuss the issue with the party high command. Weeks ago, old photographs of Thakur with Akhilesh Singh had come out, giving JD(U) an opportunity to allege that Thakur had links with the Congress. Thakur himself had reportedly said he wanted to contest elections from Muzaffarpur on a Congress ticket. With Nidan and Arbind Singh in the picture now, the JD(U)-BJP combine may get yet another opportunity to turn the tables on the Congress.Even as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into allegations of mass rape at a shelter home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur goes on, another case of exploitation of female inmates at a shelter has surfaced. The institution, Alpawas Grih, is in Hajipur, 50-odd kilometres from Muzaffarpur. Several inmates of Alpawas alleged that a senior functionary at the shelter, Manmohan Prasad Singh, often visited their floor alone and touched them inappropriately. The inmates alleged Singh also forced them to massage his legs and hit them if they refused. At least one inmate also alleged he recently tried to tear her clothes off. Singh is serving the Women Development Corporation, under the social welfare department, as its Vaishali district programme manager. Shelter manager Karuna Kumari confirmed that Singh would order all staff members to go downstairs while he himself would visit the inmates either alone or with another official, Priyanka Kumari. The inmates had reportedly complained against Singh about a month ago, following which the district magistrate ordered for a probe.

655,Waquar Ahmed,"Goa has been thrown into political crisis as the state’s chief minister   has been ailing for the past some months. Parrikar, who was the Union Defence Minister before becoming the chief minister of the state, was sent back by the BJP top brass to Goa to form the government in the state despite gaining less seats than the Congress in the last assembly elections. Parrikar did it and formed the government taking support from other political parties – Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) - and Independent MLAs. Out of 40 MLAs, BJP has 13, GFP and MGP have 3 each and there are 3 Independents while the Congress has 16 MLAs. One of the primary reasons for which GFP, MGP and Independent MLAs supported the BJP to form the government was Parrikar himself. That’s why, he was sent back to the state to get the BJP government formed. Now, as 62-year-old Parrikar has been undergoing a prolonged treatment for a pancreatic ailment and is not able to discharge his constitutional duties; the threat to the existence of the BJP government is looming large. The allies of the BJP are not ready to accept any other BJP leader as the chief minister and also forcing the saffron party to come up with a permanent solution to the current impasse. At the another hand, the Congress which has 16 MLAs, needs 5 MLAs to gain simple majority, has already met the governor Maridula Sinha to stake a claim to form the government. However, after a meeting held between BJP’s central representatives with its allies in the Goa government, the party rejected to replace ailing Parrikar with any other leader as the chief minister. It is not clear yet that how long this impasse will continue to exist. There is a discontent in regard to prevailing political situation in the state among BJP leaders too. “The situation continues to be fragile in the state. Parrikar is indisposed and he may require prolonged hospitalisation. It’s not easy to find his replacement since allies aren’t amenable to accept anyone from within the party in the chief minister’s chair,” a senior BJP functionary was quoted by the New Indian Express as saying. The possible situation that may prevail on the political landscape of the state may be like Karnataka. The Congress had formed the government there by giving the chief ministership to the JD(S) despite the BJP was the largest party in Karnataka assembly elections. Here in Goa, the Congress may repeat its Karnataka strategy to form the government. If Congress’s Karnataka strategy works here successfully, the allies of the BJP may switch to the Congress and the BJP-led government will collapse.   Also read: ",2018-09-18,"Goa political crisis,Manohar Parrikar,goa government,Ailing Manohar Parrikar,Goa Chief Minister,Goa BJP,BJP-led Goa government", Goa political crisis: Is BJP-led government heading towards collapse? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/goa-political-crisis-is-bjp-led-government-heading-towards-collapse-133193.html
656,Speed News Desk,"Clearly both, the Aryans and Dravidians were migrant races that traveled eastwards in search of pastures for their cattle and fertile land for agriculture. This is where we run into ideological problems with the ultra-nationalist and conservative Hindu gerontocracy that are foisting a new genealogy upon our nation. The word out now is that we, Indians of today, are an indigenous people. Nothing can be further from the truth. There are scientific ways to discover who we are. The recent advances in genetics have made it possible to draw linkages between peoples of different regions. Studies in India have not only confirmed that Nihar Ranjan Ray was right when he said that the Adivasi of Central India was the only real native of this country. A study by Dr. Michael Bamshad MD, geneticist at the University of Utah published in the June 2001 of Genome Research, explicitly states that the ancestors of modern upper caste Indian populations are genetically more similar to Europeans and lower caste populations are more similar to Asians. Another study conducted by Andhra University scientists BB Rao, M Naidu, BVR Prasad and others, has found the southern Indian to be quite distinct to the northern Indian, in terms of genetic makeup at least. Despite the divergent trails of genetic markers, Aryans and Dravidians may not be that far removed from each other. Linguists have for long been agreed that “English, Dutch, German, and Russian are each branches of the vast Indo-European language family, which includes Germanic, Slavic, Celtic, Baltic, Indo-Iranian and other languages, -- all descendants of more ancient languages like Greek, Latin and Sanskrit. The linguists have reconstructed an earlier language from which the latter were derived. They call it Proto-Indo-European, or PIE for short.” Dr. Alexis Manaster Ramer of Wayne State University, USA digs even deeper and finds common roots between PIE and two other language groups: Uralic, which includes Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian; and Altaic that includes Turkish and Mongolian. All these three groups, Dr. Ramer argues, find their roots in an older language called Nostratic. If he is right then all Indian languages, Sanskritic or Dravidian are descended from Nostratic, spoken about 12000 years ago? Dr. Vitaly Shevoroshkin at the Institute of Linguistics at Moscow, and another Russian scholar, Dr. Aaron Dogopolsky now at the University of Haifa, did a pioneering work in establishing the Nostratic language in the 1960s, and this today is the inspiration to younger linguists like Ramer. Language, as linguists see it, is more just the heard word and the spoken for we can even communicate with gestures and signs. According to Dr. Derek Bickerton of the University of Hawaii, “the essence of language is words and syntax, each generated by a combinational system in the brain.” Dr. Asko Parpola, a prominent Finnish scholar raises a fundamental question as to whether Sanskrit is a Dravidian language and advances enough evidence to suggest that is just what it is. Scholars have written on the similarities of words and syntax between the Dravidian languages, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Tulu, and the Finno-Ugrian languages. While the modern versions of these Dravidian languages are considerably influenced by Sanskrit words, the old writings “do not contain a single Sanskrit word.” On the other hand, some scholars argue, a number of Dravidian “loanwords” appear in the Rig Veda. Not only Sanskrit but languages like Latin and Greek too have a number of loanwords from Dravidian. For instance, the proto-Dravidian word for rice, arici is similar to oryza in Latin and Greek, and ginger is inciver in Tamil while it is ingwer in German, zinziberis in Greek. This lends much credence to the theory that the original Dravidians were of Mediterranean and Armenoid stock, who in the 4th millennium BC had settled in the Indus Valley. The continued presence of a Dravidian language, Brahui, in Pakistan’s Baluchistan province still spoken by more than half a million people, further suggests that the Dravidians moved eastwards and southwards under Aryan pressure. Whatever be its origins, it seems clear that the Sanskrit that emerged out of the Aryan Dravidian fusion was the language of a light skinned elite and was replaced by Persian, another Indo-European language of another light skinned elite. Santosh Kumar Khare on the origin of Hindi in “Truth about Language in India” (EPW, December 14, 2002) writes: “the notion of Hindi and Urdu as two distinct languages crystallized at Fort William College in the first half of the 19th century.” He adds: “their linguistic and literary repertoires were built up accordingly, Urdu borrowing from Persian/Arabic and Hindi from Sanskrit.” They came to represent the narrow competing interests of emergent middle class urban Hindu and Muslim/Kayastha groups. But the real sting is in the conclusion that “modern Hindi (or Khari boli) was an artificial construct of the East India Company which, while preserving the grammar and diction of Urdu, cleansed it of ‘foreign and rustic’ words and substituted them with Sanskrit synonyms.”   By - Mohan GuruswamyThe only indigenous people in India are the Adivasis, who Nihar Ranjan Ray described as “the original autochthonous people of India.” The rest, be they Dravidian or Aryan, Hindu or Muslim, Rajput or Jat, are migrants with as much or as little claim as the European settlers in the new world have to be known as Americans. It is true that the colonizing people in the Americas have managed to forge a distinct new identity and the world acknowledges them as that but to believe them to be an indigenous people would be akin to the patently bogus Afrikaner claim to be an indigenous African people.",2018-08-22,, WHO ARE WE? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/who-are-we-129142.html

661,Speed News Desk,"The attack on human rights workers is an attempt to silence the messenger. Given the very high credibility of the people concerned, an orchestrated campaign with the media has been used. News has itself become a strange brew of half-truths, rhetorical statements and deliberate mis-communication. In addition, the state and corporate interests exercise huge commercial control over the media, and many of the causes of tribal communities that are espoused by these activists are in direct conflict with the commercial interests of the media ownership. Users of “social media” advocate causes, make twisted statistical representations, and generate propaganda –all under the credibility that “media” enjoys in large part. The citizen is caught in a web of cross cutting information, where truth is elusive, and it is difficult to differentiate between fact and fiction. Let’s try and examine some of the facts of this FIR. The Elgar Parishad was an event organized by Dalits in celebration of an old tradition- a historic defeat of the Peshwas at the hands of the Mahars in the 1800s. Two ex judges, Justice Patil and Justice Sawant, former Supreme Court judge and former Chair of the Press Council, were part of the organizing team. On January 1, 2018, there was a clash between the Dalits and the upper castes. FIRs were lodged by the Dalits and a cross case later by the others. The accusations now added to the list, were not in the FIR and none of those arrested were present either at the Elgar Parishad, or on the of January 1. The first claim made by the Pune police was, that these were Maoists responsible for planning and fomenting the violence that took place on January 1. The claim that the arrested activists were a threat to the state and national security has been added subsequently. There is no doubt that rising inequalities in India are the leading marginalized communities – particularly Dalits and Tribals-- to organize to fight for survival and reclaiming citizenship. The citizen’s exercise of sovereignty, ie asking questions about land and natural resources, non-delivery of services, justice and dignity, especially for the most marginalized and discriminated, is branded as anti- national to escape scrutiny. Their advocates suffer the same fate and are hounded to prevent the amplification of the voices against corruption and injustice. The categorization of “anti-national” has now a twin in “urban naxal”. Vague and subjective and incomprehensible; and yet they are used to prosecute and silence people. The governments, normally riddled with corruption and arbitrary use of power, are afraid of disclosures, accountability and the rule of and by law. When they are confronted by public scrutiny into the exercise of unconstitutional power, they take refuge in accusations of terrorism, sedition etc. to suppress all questioning. The suffering communities and individuals are often the victims of the privileged elite. The RTI has legitimized questioning and the corrupt system is feeling threatened by it, as the attempts to amend and the killing of RTI users amply prove. Branding of opposition as “Maoists or terrorists”, and “urban naxalites” has enabled governments to build public acceptability, supporting arbitrary decisions made in camera. Rationality falls victim to the fear of government vendetta and silence prevails. The system protects its charges with dossiers and secret files created to indict activists. The use of the RTI has proven quite clearly that the sovereign citizen is often in ignorance of acts done in her/his name. Therefore any claim of “evidence” is suspect unless it is allowed public scrutiny. There are few tools besides the RTI to test sources of the evidence and the veracity of the testimonies. This attack on civil rights defenders is in some ways worse than the declaration of the Emergency in 1975, where the motivation was to cling to political power. This is not just about political power, but to change the ideas of justice and equity. Like then, civic space is being narrowed down and an atmosphere of fear is created. But today, people who have dedicated their lives to and speak for constitutional rights are branded as criminals and terrorists and there is a vicious attempt to destroy their credibility. An attack on the rights of civil society by gagging its spokespersons will destroy the idea of India. This idea was crafted carefully by the constituent assembly to give legitimate space for the peaceful and just co-existence of disparate cultures, ideologies and thought, to enable a steady, though difficult journey towards a more just and equitable India.   BY ARUNA ROYThere have been a set of simultaneous raids and arrests of eminent social activists and public intellectuals over which the BJP government in Maharashtra and the Centre, and many human rights organizations have been locked in a sharp polarized debate. The arrest of Sudha Bharadwaj, Gautam Navlakha, Vernon Gonsalves, Varavara Rao and Arun Ferreira, in the Bhima Koregaon is a case that has all the elements of an attempt to use an FIR to target a particular kind of dissenting voice, and use undefined terms like “urban naxal” to divert from the main issue itself. This is not just baffling for the ordinary reader – but is a new kind of threat to the democratic practices in India. ",2018-09-21,,   Attack on the conscience keepers; Attempt to silence the messenger    | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/attack-on-the-conscience-keepers-attempt-to-silence-the-messenger-133682.html
662,Speed News Desk,"Days after   chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speeches on ‘Future of India: an RSS perspective’, Congress Chief   alleged that the country’s top institutions like Supreme Court, Election Commission were being ‘systematically captured’ by the RSS. “(RSS chief) Mohan Bhagwat in his earlier speeches has said: 'We are going to organise the nation'. Who is he to organise the nation? The nation will organise itself. In next couple of months, their fantasy will be smashed,"" said Gandhi while interacting with eminent academicians from across the country at the Siri Fort. He also said that the saffron group is trying to impose one idea on the entire country but India cannot be governed by any one idea. He was further quoted by ndtv.com as saying ""What we are fighting is the attempted capture of this 'golden bird' by the RSS. They have understood very clearly that electoral battle for them, they can win it once, but they can't repeatedly win it. They have understood that. So, now what they are doing is that they are saying elections will come and elections will go, let us capture all of India's institutions and let us capture the golden bird with a bypass surgery”. Describing it how it is being done, Gandhi said “When Mr (Narendra) Modi came to power, a person from Gujarat was chosen to head the SPG. In a short time, he left the position. He told me that he refused a list of SPG officers handpicked by the RSS, and that is why he was sent home”.   Also read: ",2018-09-23,"Rahul Gandhi,RSS,rashtriya swayamsevak sangh,Inda's top institutions,Supreme Court,Elections Commissions"," After Mohan Bhagwat’s speech, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi explains how India’s top institutions being ‘systemically captured’ by RSS | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/after-mohan-bhagwat-s-speech-congress-chief-rahul-gandhi-explains-how-india-s-top-institutions-being-systemically-captured-by-rss-133880.html

He said that the game has just begun, he will do more things in the coming 2-3 months.  While addressing social media workers in his parliamentary constituency Amethi, he accused the Prime Minister Narendra Modi of snatching away money from the poor and gave it to industrialist Anil Ambani. ""Ye jo bhrashtachaar ke khilaf ladne aaya tha, isi ne Anil Ambani ko 30,000 crore rupaye pakda diye. Abhi toh shuruwat hui hai, abhi dekhna, maza aayega, aane wale 2-3 mahine mein aisa maza dikhayenge hum aapko (The one who came to power to fight corruption, handed over Rs 30,000 crore to Anil Ambani.

665,Speed News Desk,"After the Central government brought in ordinance criminalizing triple talaq, West Bengal state minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury refused to adhere by the law and called it playing with the religion and the constitution. He also said that the Quran will prevail over the constitution. Chowdhury was quoted by the Indian Express as saying “For us, our holy scripture, the Quran Sharif, is supreme and if any constitutional provision or any law contradicts the Quran, then our scripture will prevail and not the law or Constitution… BJP is playing the religion card and is playing with Constitution. The ordinance will have no effect on Muslims. No one will adhere to it, but will follow the religion and the holy book”. Some of the Muslim groups are reportedly planning to hold protest the ordinance and called it an interference with the religion. The state minister, who is also the state president of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, further said “Whatever tricks BJP may play, they will not be able to influence Hindus or Muslims. In 2019, they are on their way out. The ordinance is just a way of winning Hindu votes, which they will not succeed. Hindus and Muslims will throw them out of power”. Pointing to daily violence against women, the minister said “Every day, women and girls are being raped. Every day, women are being burnt and brutalised. What are they (BJP government at the Centre) doing? They are doing nothing about it. But for cheap vote bank politics, (they are) hurting the sentiments of Muslims”.
